Many of you may be quarantined with an abuser or dealing with their ramped up abuse due to their proximity or need for that outlet. Abusers are coming back from years ago to get to you with hoovers. Being isolated is very hard and this is a situation completely unexpected and anxiety driving in and of itself. So we wanted to put together a listing of resources, many of which are listed in our resource listing in the sidebar for you in this difficult time. Stay safe out there, folks. We are right here with you, and we will get through this together. \\n\\n\\nSupport for Domestic Abuse:\\n\\n* [Thehotline.org]( https://www.thehotline.org/) is available 24/7 for chat and calls (1800-787-3224) during this crisis for women, men as well as LGBTQ folks.

They will then also be in the area for you to use in person when the pandemic ends allowing you to have consistency and develop an effective relationship.

       "'We know many of you are struggling to manage with already traumatic events and now are dealing with a global pandemic of COVID-19. Many of you may be quarantined with an abuser or dealing with their ramped up abuse due to their proximity or need for that outlet. Abusers are coming back from years ago to get to you with hoovers. Being isolated is very hard and this is a situation completely unexpected and anxiety driving in and of itself. So we wanted to put together a listing of resources, many of which are listed in our resource listing in the sidebar for you in this difficult time. Stay safe out there, folks. We are right here with you, and we will get through this together. \\n\\n\\nSupport for Domestic Abuse:\\n\\n* [Thehotline.org]( https://www.thehotline.org/) is available 24/7 for chat and calls (1800-787-3224) during this crisis for women, men as well as LGBTQ folks. Please be sure to use safe electronics to contact them or any agency if an abuser has access to them. They also offer a [Safety Planning]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/for-yourself/safety-planning/interactive-safety-plan/) through [LOVEISRESPECT]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/) which is also available 24/7. \\n\\n\\n* [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) is still operating their crisis lines 24/7 along with chat capabilities. They can be there for sexual assault victims. \\n\\n* [1in6]( https://1in6.org/) is a resource for men who have been abused/sexually assaulted. They are available right now with weekly support group online meetings in addition to a 24/7 chat line. They work with [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) for a resource just for men. \\n\\n* [SurvivorsUK]( https://www.survivorsuk.org/) is there for male rape and sexual abuse victims 12PM-8PM in the UK. \\n\\n* [CODA]( https://coda.org/) runs online support groups for people struggling with Codependency. They have physical meetings in many places in normal times, but have a number of online support groups for those needs. \\n\\n* [HOTPEACH]( https://hotpeachpages.net/) is a site where they direct you to services for domestic abuse internationally. It’s a great resource for non-US resources. \\n\\n* [DomesticShelters]( https://www.domesticshelters.org/) is a resource to help you locate shelters and resources. They also have online support groups. \\n\\n* [FAMILY SANCTUARY]( https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/safety-planning-covid19/) offers safety planning direction and support. \\n\\n* [REDROVER]( https://redrover.org/news/coronavirus-covid19/) helps with safety planning for your pets and resources. \\n\\n* [LGBT Foundation]( https://www.lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/domestic-abuse) is still working to provide you with services during this stressful time to the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nResources For Suicide Hotlines (Please dial emergency services if you are a threat to your safety):\\n\\n* [SUICIDEWATCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=NarcissisticAbuse&amp;utm_content=t5_2ys1m) is the sub at Reddit that has the listings of suicide hotlines and organizations there to help you in your time of need. It’s a vast listing with an FAQ. Please reach out. \\n\\n* [US Suicide Hotline Directory]( http://suicidehotlines.com/national.html) for those of you in the USA.\\n\\n* [International Suicide Hotline Directory]( http://suicidehotlines.com/international.html) for crisis lines internationally. \\n\\nTherapy Options:\\n \\n* [WEAREHEARTED]( https://www.wearehearted.com/) is offering video calls for help and support during this time of isolation and social distancing.     \\n\\n* Many therapists in your local area are offering their services through [TELEMEDICINE]( https://www.goodrx.com/blog/what-is-telemedicine/) so that you can have sessions online through ZOOM/SKYPE/FACETIME. They will then also be in the area for you to use in person when the pandemic ends allowing you to have consistency and develop an effective relationship. Please still know you want to find one with experience treating victims of abuse. \\n\\n* [AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OVERVIEW]( https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/online-therapy ) for the AMA discussion on how online therapy works and how to select a service for yourself. \\n\\n* [ONLINE THERAPY SERVICES]( https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-therapy-4691206) and [ONLINE THERAPY SERVICES]( https://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/)  gives a overview of various companies (we do not endorse their ratings and do not know if they are sponsored) as well as [TALKSPACE]( https://www.talkspace.com/) and [BETTERHELP]( https://www.betterhelp.com/online-counseling/)  but again, we do not endorse any one company. \\n\\nWe also want to point out that we will not allow medical discussion here about COVID-19 or giving medical advice. Please seek out the facts from the original sources:\\n\\n* [/r/COVID19]( https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\\n\\n* [r/CORONAVIRUS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Centers For Disease Control And Prevention]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\\n\\n* [World Health Organization]( https://www.who.int/)'"
