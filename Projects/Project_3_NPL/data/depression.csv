###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,0,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2316,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2316,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

Depression is a lack of energy. 

Lacking the energy and motivation to do the most mundane tasks. From doing dishes, to even personal hygiene like taking showers and brushing your teeth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is Wanting to maintain relationships but also, not wanting to maintain relationships. 

Relationships involve energy. You want to have people in your life but they want to do things like hang out and text and call. Depression makes you not want to socialize. Depression makes getting dressed and ready to go out somewhere like its a grueling task. Even the thought makes you overwhelmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression makes even the smallest inconveniences feel like the end of your world. 

forgetting that a subscription was taking your last 15 dollars out of your account, puts you into a whirlwind of downward spiral. It's not the thing itself that makes you want to die but its what brought up all of your suicidal ideations again.

 

Depression is the everyday longing of not wanting to exist.

Most of the time you don't want to kill yourself. But you sure as hell don't want to be alive. You imagine crossing a road and a bus accidentally wipes you out, and it brings a glimmer of hope that maybe that will happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is needing someone to talk to but not wanting to burden your loved ones. 

You wish you could tell someone all of your deepest darkest thoughts but everyone in your life is dealing with their own issues and you wouldn't want to add yours to theirs. So you stay quiet. Letting it eat you a little more inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is actively telling yourself it will get better. 

When you're in your deepest depression, even thinking ""it will get better"" makes you feel sick, like its some joke. How could anything get better? I'm stuck. There's nowhere to go from here. But you have to think it will get better. You're brain, your innate instinct to survive, tells you to just hold on a little longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meds. They might work some day. You might get the right dosage, the right meds, the correct combination. You might. But then the depression says it takes too long to try. It's so much effort. So much trial and error. The doctors say it takes roughly 30 days for an anti depressant to tell if it's working. That's a month, every time you get a new med to try that ultimately doesn't work... Again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is exhaustion. physical but mostly mental. 

It's being tired of trying. Tired of the fight. Tired of telling yourself the meds might work this time, you're feeling a little bit better. but that turns into false hope and you're right back where you started. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you continue on. Smiling every now and then. Maybe even feeling happiness once in a while. But it's always there. It's always lurking in the background. Waiting, stalking. But you'll get through it right? You have to get through it. Too many people rely on you to be alive.

&lt;p&gt;Not only for myself, but just seeing things out in the general public sphere. You know what I mean, old guys tousling young boys hair. Seeing guys do the &amp;quot;Bro&amp;quot; handshake (as I call it), in all its permutations, manners and variations. Girlfriend hugs. The way guys slap each other on the back in that collegial and familiar way. Grandmas hugging grandkids. Grandfathers as well. Friends, siblings and lovers throwing each other that good natured joshing elbow, or light punch to the shoulder...messing around, playing around, joking, happy, having fun. High fives, low fives, mid-range fives. Dancing. Playful wrestling. So called &amp;quot;Horseplay&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything where people are enjoying each other, and enjoying that person-to-person contact. The pleasure of meeting new people, interacting with them, that closeness of an intimate conversation, a harmless secret with someone not known well...but still done without fear or reserve. I miss humanity...sometimes. I mean usually, human beings get on my nerves, lol, but you know what I mean.   :)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"TW: suicide, child abuse

It's funny, despite all the hullabaloo about 'mental illness awareness' you see these days I have never felt more alienated. People just simply do not care, in fact, a lot of them think your suffering is funny. Remember Chester Bennington? He put how he felt into his music. People's response was to mock it and make a meme out of it. ""Haha crawling in my skin, amirite?"" What a melodramatic pussy. Nevermind that Chester was molested as a child, an act that causes severe psychological damage that someone will have to deal with for the rest of their life. Obviously Chester did not know true suffering, like when that bitch Becky wore the same green dress as me despite the fact she knew I wanted to wear it, or that time some asshole in front of me was only going 5 miles over the speed limit instead of the 20 I wanted to go. You know, real world problems.

Of course, when he ended up taking his life due to his pain suddenly all these same people were fans who got through hard times thanks to his music. Absolutely sickening. Completely and utterly fucking fake. It's amazing how fake people are. Not long ago they were mocking how he felt, now they were getting those sweet likes and retweets off of his suicide.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny, despite all the hullabaloo about &amp;#39;mental illness awareness&amp;#39; you see these days I have never felt more alienated. People just simply do not care, in fact, a lot of them think your suffering is funny. Remember Chester Bennington? He put how he felt into his music. People&amp;#39;s response was to mock it and make a meme out of it. &amp;quot;Haha crawling in my skin, amirite?&amp;quot; What a melodramatic pussy. Nevermind that Chester was molested as a child, an act that causes severe psychological damage that someone will have to deal with for the rest of their life. Obviously Chester did not know true suffering, like when that bitch Becky wore the same green dress as me despite the fact she knew I wanted to wear it, or that time some asshole in front of me was only going 5 miles over the speed limit instead of the 20 I wanted to go. You know, real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when he ended up taking his life due to his pain suddenly all these same people were fans who got through hard times thanks to his music. Absolutely sickening. Completely and utterly fucking fake. It&amp;#39;s amazing how fake people are. Not long ago they were mocking how he felt, now they were getting those sweet likes and retweets off of his suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2019 I left an abusive relationship for good. In 2019 I left my toxic home environment for good. I went abroad and found myself – outside of abuse and harm. I spent the year learning and growing. I made new friends and had new experiences. I got my first tattoo. After I left such a toxic environment, the skills I had been learning for the past 7 years finally began to work. I could finally comfort myself, appreciate myself and feed myself without hating my body. I finally developed relationships with real boundaries and genuine care. 

In March of 2020, I moved back to the house I never thought I would be in again. I began to hate myself. My own thoughts drowned by the mindless shaming that I experienced. My family filled my room with their unwanted items. I began to feel swallowed with the feeling of being forgotten. Surrounded by unwanted items, I began to feel unwanted. I woke up in pain and I fell asleep in pain. I cried until my head hurt so badly that I couldn’t move. I watched my dad welcome my sexual assaulter into my home. I listened to my mom as she told me that they loved me, and that this – the toxicity – was all in my head. 

In June 2020, I can’t decide if I am more scared to die or to live the rest of my life with these feelings inside of me. I feel like I am locked inside of 4 green walls.

,depression,"Hey y'all. This is going to be one of those long-ass posts I don't expect anyone to read; I'm writing this to get my thoughts down without the expectation of an answer. But if you do finish it and have something to add, some words of encouragement, a slap in the face, etc. I would warmly accept that. 

A few things about me, since I'm quite new to this community: I am living in Los Angeles, 29 years old, married, and have a baby daughter. I completed my teaching credential in February but am currently unemployed after an aggressive job hunt this year and several failed interviews. My wife works from home and makes OK money, but we're barely getting by after her post-lockdown pay cut. 

I have been battling depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old and have considered suicide many times but have not carried it through. In March, when the lockdowns first started, I was turned down for a job and had a breakdown. That was the first time I had ever called the suicide hotline and began to take my mental health very seriously. The reality is that I have a family now and can't fuck around with my health anymore. 

I did carry on and got into a daily routine that worked for me. The last couple of months have been challenging, but it wasn't until the past week that I started to get that ""I don't see the point in waking up today"" feeling that was so prevalent throughout my childhood. And I've been trying to figure out why that's happened.

The crux of it, I think, is that **I don't think people really care what I have to say about anything, nor do I suspect they ever will**. The older I get, the easier it is to picture a future where I accomplish virtually nothing of value in my life and have no lasting impact on the world. Which is to say, I'm losing hope.

As I already mentioned, I want to be a teacher. With everything going on in my country, I'm more certain of that than ever. Kids need good teachers with passion and something to say. But will I ever get hired? I don't know. The interviews so far haven't given me reason to hope. I look in the mirror and I see a spindly, weak, boyish-looking 29 year old with bad teeth that can't grow a decent beard and I wonder why *anyone* would want to put me in charge of a classroom. God, it seemed like every fucking day when I was student teaching, someone asked if I was a student. My supervisors thought I did great work and gave me glowing recommendations, but I don't feel like it matters. And I *know* that's part of the problem. It's a cycle of defeat.

The other thing that's beating me down, and I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible, is that a project I've been working on for years - my dream, really - suddenly feels pointless. To me, anyway. 

Four years ago, I got off Lexapro and went into a spiral, so I started re-evaluating what mattered to me. I rekindled a silly dream I had as a kid: I wanted to start my own cartoon show. I contacted an artist friend of mine at college and we made a lot of progress. In fact, we've turned the series into a graphic novel and I'm trying to find representation for it so we can ink it and make some money. The work that has been done on this project has been a major source of pride for me.

But, all of a sudden, with current events being what they are, I don't think anyone wants the story I'm trying to tell. Crucially, the cast is largely white and male, set in a rural portion of America that is often forgotten. It's kind of a...King of the Hill meets Daria kind of thing. I wanted to tell my story growing up in a small town, how the youth of America can overcome racism, sexism, poverty, domestic violence and alcoholism in their communities to become good, upstanding people. How the cycle can be broken. That middle America can be a place of hope, not an anchor dragging everyone else down. 

On paper, maybe that sounds promising. But when I look at how painfully *white* and *masculine* this concept is, coming from a white male, I feel embarrassed. I see what's coming out and just want to shelve the whole thing. Like...who the fuck cares? 

And I suppose that gets to the heart of the matter: I'm not proud of who I am and I don't feel like anyone needs to hear from me right now. My wife and daughter need me, yes. I'm not going to kill myself. I'm going to stick things out to the end. I shudder to think what my life would be like without them. But do I feel strong, meaningful, valuable in a greater context? No. I'm a just a guy, who can't even get a job after all the education in the world, and whatever ambitions I had for the future seem frivolous and wildly unrealistic now. More so every day.

I think that's enough about me for now. If you read this entire thing, thanks a lot. It helped me out just to verbalize some of the really dark, hopeless feelings I've been having lately.",t2_t8id4,False,,0,False,"Feeling irrelevant, unmotivated and hopeless",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hcj0lb,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592672932.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;#39;all. This is going to be one of those long-ass posts I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to read; I&amp;#39;m writing this to get my thoughts down without the expectation of an answer. But if you do finish it and have something to add, some words of encouragement, a slap in the face, etc. I would warmly accept that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things about me, since I&amp;#39;m quite new to this community: I am living in Los Angeles, 29 years old, married, and have a baby daughter. I completed my teaching credential in February but am currently unemployed after an aggressive job hunt this year and several failed interviews. My wife works from home and makes OK money, but we&amp;#39;re barely getting by after her post-lockdown pay cut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been battling depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old and have considered suicide many times but have not carried it through. In March, when the lockdowns first started, I was turned down for a job and had a breakdown. That was the first time I had ever called the suicide hotline and began to take my mental health very seriously. The reality is that I have a family now and can&amp;#39;t fuck around with my health anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did carry on and got into a daily routine that worked for me. The last couple of months have been challenging, but it wasn&amp;#39;t until the past week that I started to get that &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t see the point in waking up today&amp;quot; feeling that was so prevalent throughout my childhood. And I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out why that&amp;#39;s happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of it, I think, is that &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think people really care what I have to say about anything, nor do I suspect they ever will&lt;/strong&gt;. The older I get, the easier it is to picture a future where I accomplish virtually nothing of value in my life and have no lasting impact on the world. Which is to say, I&amp;#39;m losing hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned, I want to be a teacher. With everything going on in my country, I&amp;#39;m more certain of that than ever. Kids need good teachers with passion and something to say. But will I ever get hired? I don&amp;#39;t know. The interviews so far haven&amp;#39;t given me reason to hope. I look in the mirror and I see a spindly, weak, boyish-looking 29 year old with bad teeth that can&amp;#39;t grow a decent beard and I wonder why &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; would want to put me in charge of a classroom. God, it seemed like every fucking day when I was student teaching, someone asked if I was a student. My supervisors thought I did great work and gave me glowing recommendations, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like it matters. And I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that&amp;#39;s part of the problem. It&amp;#39;s a cycle of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that&amp;#39;s beating me down, and I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this as concise as possible, is that a project I&amp;#39;ve been working on for years - my dream, really - suddenly feels pointless. To me, anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I got off Lexapro and went into a spiral, so I started re-evaluating what mattered to me. I rekindled a silly dream I had as a kid: I wanted to start my own cartoon show. I contacted an artist friend of mine at college and we made a lot of progress. In fact, we&amp;#39;ve turned the series into a graphic novel and I&amp;#39;m trying to find representation for it so we can ink it and make some money. The work that has been done on this project has been a major source of pride for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, all of a sudden, with current events being what they are, I don&amp;#39;t think anyone wants the story I&amp;#39;m trying to tell.

,depression,"Let me try to explain what makes it such a piece of shit. 

I was born with Fibromyalgia, I was in an accident in 2013 that left me with a broken back, major head injury and hip issues. Since then I have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. They are not sure if I have always been schizophrenic or if it was brought on by the head injury. Since I don't remember most of my childhood now, I can't be sure either. 

Why does it matter? Because every day I wake up in immense pain. Live a 7 on the pain scale. I'm exhuasted and I never sleep. I am confused more often than not. I can't remember anything. Can't hold on to knew information well. I have multiple voices in my head and I hallucinate regularly. 

I had a relationship when I hit my head. A relationship of a solid 7 years. And then all of a sudden I was a different person. He stayed. He tries. But I can see this life takes a toll on him. I'm not the woman he married. How could he love me? I am so different and he now has to endure spending time with my other sides when they decide to take over. (Yes I am aware this is Atypical for schizophrenia, but I have been informed that I do not have D.I.D as when they take over I do not black out, I just cannot do anything to control my movements or speech. )

Over all my life is shit. I can't get a job. My doctor is an ass hole who thinks a 29 year old female with xrays of her broken fucking back is too young to be in pain so he refuses to prescribe me anything go help. Instead I take 6-8 over the counter back pain pills (basically rpbaxacil) and tylenol when I can afford it. Said ass hat doctor won't fill out the disability forms because I'm 29. According to him, it's my period. I live very rural and I don't have any money to travel anywhere. My partner was disabled when we moved in together and is on a fixed income.

My best friends (we’re a group of 3) that I’ve known since I was 13 were one of my main support systems. To be honest, I don’t approach anyone else other than them and my clinical psychologist to talk about my depression.

,depression,"Recently broke up with my gf of nearly a year. I didn't realize how much I liked her until I got dumped.

I can't stop trying to make light and jokes about things and acting like I'm okay or like I'm a chad who doesn't give a fuck. I can't control it I just lie and retreat into this fuck boy like persona whenever my break up comes up. 

My ex was always shy and pretty tsundere like, almost never expressed her affection in words but usually in the form of a rare grapple to my arm as we study. Always had a fear that she didn't REALLY like me but i kept burrying it because of the joy i had just being with her at the time. 

She was almost asexual making me also feel like she didnt like me, and now that i dwell on it she probably didnt. It wasnt until 3 months of us being a couple and spending the nights together until took her bra off and bit later give me a blow. It was probably out of pity. She never took her pants off and would refuse to change in front of me unless i looked away. I'm more of one to want to give pleasure and this kinda threw me off but i knew she had a lot of insecurities and i always wanted to make sure she was okay so i never pushed her on it. This lack of sexual desire from her led my already low confidence even lower and maybe i was just not good enough. I just wanted her to be happy.

She was an exchange student and eventually she had to back to her home country and I was commited to stay with her and meeting this summer. With covid i couldn't fulfil that and as the months went by i could really feel her distancing herself from me. My messages would be met with short answers and long waits. I even thought that maybe i should break up with her. 

One night she asks if im free and we call as usualy and she says how she feels like she doesn't like me as much as i like her and that makes her feel bad so she wants to break up. Atm i was also thinking the same thing and this is probably the best option and we left off and friends.
Since then no contact but she seems to be the first person to see my stories SMS but maybe thats just my brain. Being broken up and looking back at evrything made me realize that she didn't love me. She never once said ""i love you"" without me asking or saying it first, to which i would just get ""i do"" or ""me too"". 

It really pains me that it seems like I'm always in a one way relationship, maybe im too clingy.

To everyone i act cool about it, but i can't control myself. I'm not okay, I want to feel loved. 

God, when did i become so pathetic. What happned to me. I just want this to end.
I'm leaving a lot out and I really dont want to post this but i can't sleep.

This lack of sexual desire from her led my already low confidence even lower and maybe i was just not good enough. I just wanted her to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was an exchange student and eventually she had to back to her home country and I was commited to stay with her and meeting this summer. With covid i couldn&amp;#39;t fulfil that and as the months went by i could really feel her distancing herself from me. My messages would be met with short answers and long waits. I even thought that maybe i should break up with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night she asks if im free and we call as usualy and she says how she feels like she doesn&amp;#39;t like me as much as i like her and that makes her feel bad so she wants to break up. Atm i was also thinking the same thing and this is probably the best option and we left off and friends.
Since then no contact but she seems to be the first person to see my stories SMS but maybe thats just my brain. Being broken up and looking back at evrything made me realize that she didn&amp;#39;t love me. She never once said &amp;quot;i love you&amp;quot; without me asking or saying it first, to which i would just get &amp;quot;i do&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;me too&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really pains me that it seems like I&amp;#39;m always in a one way relationship, maybe im too clingy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone i act cool about it, but i can&amp;#39;t control myself. I&amp;#39;m not okay, I want to feel loved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, when did i become so pathetic. What happned to me. I just want this to end.
I&amp;#39;m leaving a lot out and I really dont want to post this but i can&amp;#39;t sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things I&amp;#39;ve just been extremely anxious about other life events. God I&amp;#39;m all over the place rn and the spelling and format of this post will probably drive me insane.&lt;/p&gt;

Then my mom told me today I was going to go out and eat with my family. I didn’t want to but I didn’t have much choice. I showered and no joke, a few hours after being with my family made me feel a lot better.

I leave tomorrow for a few days in the forests and I have already started seeing a therapist so please dont feel any need to respond or anything. I just wrote this so I can start the process of clawing my way back to reality. This is to acknowledge my past inability to be open and to force myself into self-expression and forgive myself for one of many regrets. So yea I&amp;#39;m sorry to be selfish and unload this on you, again don&amp;#39;t respond if you r uncomfortable in the slightest which you probably should be considering how weird this all is. Still Ive decided to be open and stop worrying, I dont regret sending this I regret waiting so long to do so. So in case you dont respond have a good life I genuinely wish you the best and don&amp;#39;t worry about me I think Im finally on my way back to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this. Im scared of missing out and being left behind too. I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I believe that i won't ever have kids or a wife like everyone else . I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls. Most people i know are in relationships and i want one with all of the good stuff that comes along with it because im sitting her fucking lonely, upset , jealous, sick to my stomach 24-7, LIKE WHY DO WOMEN ON TINDER AND IRL HATE SPEECH PROBLEMS???

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours on some nights). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

,depression,"Hi. I don’t know if I’d say I’m depressed now, but up until recently I had been for years. Like all of middle school, high school, and most of college. 

Probably the most noticeable aspect of my depression for others was just how silent I was. I remember sitting in lunch rooms in high school and not speaking a single word even as I sat at a table full of people I knew. This went on for years. I think I now have social anxiety just due to being completely unused to speaking up and sharing with others and being in the spotlight. This exists in every realm of my life. On reddit I hardly post or comment, I never actually tweet, my instagram account is like 6 years old but has 4 pictures. Its not that I don’t want to use these things. Or that I don’t want to talk to people and be social. I do. I just don’t think the things I have to contribute are valuable enough, or I don’t want the attention that comes with speaking. 

But I’ve been working on it, and I’m becoming much more confident. So much so that recently I have been talking a fair amount. It’s felt really nice actually. But that’s where the issue is. Last week I was talking to my best friend and I knew she wasn’t listening to me and I pointed it out. She simply said that I talk too much for her to be able to pay attention to all of it. That might be fair. I get that I can’t have someone’s complete and undivided attention. It still hurt though. And I’ll occasionally bring up things I’ve talked about or told her in the past few days, but she’ll always say I never actually told her that. But I did, she just doesn’t listen to it. A person I dated last year literally asked me if I had ADHD because they thought I talk too much. I was just excited and telling a story. Today I was talking to my sister and I could tell she wasn’t listening to me and I told her about how I feel like no one ever listens to me. Literally as I was saying it she interrupted me and changed the subject. 

I get that its not a huge thing, but it just kind of sucks. I was miserable for years and now that I’m finally feeling like I’ve made some progress, it’s like it’s unwanted. It’s like everyone is used to the depressed version of me and now that I finally feel like I’m finally making progress I’m too much. So I guess I talk too much and overshare. Which just feels like no one cares about what I have to say which really feels like no one cares about me. So now I’m talking less. And I’m getting worse. And it feels like shit.

,depression,"ok so lets just get into it then

&amp;#x200B;

so i am a 14 year old girl from the USA (Georgia)  and I am so tired and depressed because of a few things

1. i am a closet atheist to my Jesus freak christian family (that is also raciest and homophobic btw) and i don't want to come out because i am afraid my family will kick me out and disown me, just leave me on the streets to die   
2. i am also a closet pan-sexual that is in a poly relationship (3 other amazing people that are the only reason I haven't went through with killing myself yet) to my family (my friends know i""m pan but only one knows i""m in a poly)
3. i also sometimes do self harm due to my sever anxiety and depression. I have confessed the anxiety and suicidal thots(heh)  to a therapist  and got meds. i have been getting different kinds of meds and different therapy for a wile (its a year in 2 weeks yay) and none of it has worked so now all i feel is........just sleepy
4. i have migraines that come on with sound, stress, and sometimes i just wake up with them in the middle of the night sooooo... that hasn't been helping my mood at all

i just need to know what i can do to make it a bit better because the thots (he he i'm funny) are getting to be to much and i don't want to leave my partners or my friend (she is more like the sister i never had tbh) i couldn't care less if i left my family (i might do a r/entitledparents post on them) so any advice on if i should come out to my family or other things i can do to help my anxiety  and thots(lols)

&lt;p&gt;so i am a 14 year old girl from the USA (Georgia)  and I am so tired and depressed because of a few things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am a closet atheist to my Jesus freak christian family (that is also raciest and homophobic btw) and i don&amp;#39;t want to come out because i am afraid my family will kick me out and disown me, just leave me on the streets to die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am also a closet pan-sexual that is in a poly relationship (3 other amazing people that are the only reason I haven&amp;#39;t went through with killing myself yet) to my family (my friends know i&amp;quot;m pan but only one knows i&amp;quot;m in a poly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i also sometimes do self harm due to my sever anxiety and depression. I have confessed the anxiety and suicidal thots(heh)  to a therapist  and got meds. i have been getting different kinds of meds and different therapy for a wile (its a year in 2 weeks yay) and none of it has worked so now all i feel is........just sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have migraines that come on with sound, stress, and sometimes i just wake up with them in the middle of the night sooooo... that hasn&amp;#39;t been helping my mood at all&lt;/li&gt;

,depression,"It all started last Summer.

I was 19, had finally escaped from an abusive and toxic relationship, and found myself working a new job at a small, failing cafe.

This is where I met Stuart (Not his real name.)

He was 21, charming, funny, handsome, everyone adored him, and - he was my supervisor, and he made it clear that he had the power to fire me (Not to mention the owner of the cafe likely had hickeys on her ass the way Stuart kissed it).

Stuart became my de facto shoulder to cry on as my ex boyfriend continued his attempts to abuse me after our breakup and I struggled with the aftermath of experiencing years of emotional/physical/sexual/financial abuse.

I detailed to him every cruel word, and every violation of my boundaries. Typically, I’d make jokes about my pain and trauma, quoting “I laugh, because I will cry if I don’t”, so I’m not sure if he took it too seriously. Humor was my coping mechanism.

He was willing to listen to my stories and offer comfort and support, but would occasionally discredit what I said, accusing me of making it up, “Oh, he didn’t really say that”, “You make him sound like a villain”, I remember him retorting.

I also admitted to him my issues with my physically absent father, my body image issues and past struggles with anorexia/bulimia, and low self esteem.

I always have had a problem with oversharing, and looking back I really regret opening up to Stuart the way that I did.

He opened up to me too, about his GAD, his toxic relationship with his ex of five years - their constant verbal and physical fights, their drug use, and their mutual cheating on each other.

Stuart also opened up to me that he, too, endured sexual assault at a young age. He assured me that not all men were like my ex, that he was a nice guy, the exception. I believed him.

Stuart was a big promoter of mental health awareness and therapy, and would constantly spout his insights and what he’d learn from being a psychology major, and when I told him how I felt quite miserable and hopeless after escaping the abusive relationship and didn’t know if I was truly depressed, he said “You don’t have depression. That would mean you can’t get out of bed”. I hid the fact that I felt quite suicidal from him because he talked shit about a girl he had slept with because she cut herself. I don’t even feel like I deserve to call myself depressed now, because it’s not like what’s happened to me was a big deal.

We flirted, I sent him racy pictures in a desperate plea for validation (My ex would body-shame me and I struggled with an eating disorder my entire adolescence). He repeatedly asked me to “hook up” with him. I told him, however, that I could only have sex with someone I was in a relationship with.

In between his declarations of my beauty and sense of humor and intelligence, he would pepper in a few insults he‘d call “jokes” after seeing how they offended me.

He would make fun of me for having an unathletic, underweight body, how I had a weird laugh, how I showed signs of autism, how I’d make mistakes at work, etc.

Although he picked on me, he’d insist on skipping his lunch breaks because he liked spending time with me at work.

I thought “he’s so much nicer than my ex”.

When he stood me up for a date to see Midsommar, he texted me days later that he wanted to just be friends, that he was dealing with a lot, and that he was in the process of being diagnosed with bipolar.

He told me that he knew I had a crush on him. That was true. I did.

Despite my crush, I agreed with staying platonic friends, and tried to avoid flirtation as best as I could, though I did send him the occasional picture or talk about sex if he mentioned it.

He would still shower me in a delicate blend of compliments and thinly veiled insults disguised as “jokes”. I knew if I wanted everything to stay normal at my job, I’d have to play along.

A few months later, Stuart admitted to me that he was going to rehab for an addiction to painkillers. The night before he was scheduled to be admitted, he asked if we could be “friends with benefits”.

I said “I thought you just wanted to be friends”

“Friends can have sex”, he replied

I told him no, with my body image issues and struggles with past assault, I didn’t feel comfortable.

He attempted to convince me he could make me feel comfortable with men and sex again. He mentioned that we both found each other attractive.

I was confused, as friends with benefits implied no feelings. He knew I had feelings for him. Why would he initiate this type of relationship with me?

I felt so pressured, the way he’d been asking me for such a long time. I was scared of what would happen if I kept saying no. I was never able to tell my ex no.

A few days later, he was out of rehab, and we made plans to go to the movies after our shift together. I wanted to cheer him up and support him because of his substance abuse problems. 

We didn’t go to the movies. We went to his house.

Fooling around on his air mattress, I asked “Do you have a condom?”

“Um, no”

“I don’t want to have sex without a condom” I repeated every time he got a little bit too close for comfort.

Eventually, he ignored me and stuck it in. It hurt.

Stuart didn’t pull out until a few seconds after I started hitting him. I was so shocked, I acted like it didn’t just happen. 

Driving me home, he asked “Remember when you said you’d only let a boyfriend fuck you?”

My mind was racing. My self worth was so tied up in my “number”, my self esteem was in the gutter, he technically already had sex with me, I still had a crush on him, and - we still worked together; he was still my manager.

So - I continued to have sex with him. I hate myself for doing so.

He complained that his Zoloft prescription made it impossible to get hard while wearing a condom, and bitched and moaned that I was the only girl to make him wear one. I felt pressured.

I thought “Well, if I were to catch something, I’d have already caught it”.

I quit making him wear condoms.

When I had a flashback from a past assault and cried during sex, he complained that I made him feel bad.

He kept trying to stick his finger in my ass when I told him not to until finally, I let him, to make him happy.

He spat on my face and, when I was visibility upset, said “You told me you were into that”. I never told him that.

Sex was excruciating for me, so he’d force me to be quiet when it hurt, because he still lived at home and didn’t want his mom to hear.

When I jokingly mentioned the time he fucked me without a condom when I told him not to, he said “You’re making me sound like a predator”

I let him film me occasionally with the promise of not recording my face. He recorded my face in the videos. I overlooked this at the time.

He wrote a song for me called “(my name) is a whore/When she comes over/I know I’ll score”

Pathetically and regrettably, I thanked him for being “more respectful than my ex”.

Looking back, that’s like thanking your cat for shitting on your tile floor instead of your white polyester sofa, when your cat should be shitting in their litter box. (a classy simile)

Despite all this, he’d tell me how beautiful I was and how he adored me and how he quit talking to other girls because he was obsessed with me.  He’d ask me for more racy material as he said I “ruined porn” for him. Even though our relationship was sexual, he told me he could play Monopoly with me fully clothed and not have sex and he’d still be perfectly happy, because he loved me as a person. 

I thought “Whatever happened to no feelings? He’s being more affectionate than my ex”

Eventually, I left my job because, as it was a failing business, they couldn’t afford to give me more than fifteen hours a week.

Yet, I continued to have sex with him. I was so desperate to prove to myself that he was the good guy that he said he was. I wanted to believe that he really did care - that I wasn’t cursed romantically and sexually.

I’d praise him for being such a wonderful guy in an attempt to convince myself that he really was.

I thought I was empowered and having sex on my own terms, because when I told him to stop, he’d stop most of the time, unless he said that my “stop” confused him, because he didn’t know if I was being serious or not. 

When I tried to break things off with him because I equated sex with love and our “no feelings” situation was confusing me, he said he was obsessed with me, but couldn’t commit because I planned on moving away for my career, and he didn’t want to set himself up for heartbreak. 

Towards the end of our relationship, he mentioned several times that his ex was trying to contact him, but he assured me that he was done with her and was ignoring her.

Then he stopped texting me, when we used to text each other daily. Weeks went by.

I asked him if he could return the DVD’s I left at his house (Several rare, expensive copies that were valuable to me), and he blew me off and ignored me.

I saw a photo of him with his ex on social media. I was enraged. He didn’t even have the guts to tell me directly that he wanted to end things.

I angrily texted him to give me back my DVD’s, to delete the photos/videos he had of me, and to never talk to me again. I told him that I couldn’t believe that I thought he respected me.

Sure, I overreacted, but I felt so hurt.

I should mention I was very upset during this time because my grandmother had died after a long illness where I was her part time carer, and I had lost two close friends of mine recently.

“I hope we can be mature enough about this to stay friends”, he responded, after emphasizing that he was “always respectful” towards me.

When I told him I thought it best if we didn’t speak to each other anymore, he replied “Just trying to be nice”

He added that I was too emotional and that’s why he got back with his ex without telling me, that I “was always upset about something” so he didn’t want to tell me, reminding me that it was nothing but casual sex with no feelings, that he never really liked me, and I was delusional for thinking that he did. Every nice thing he said to me, he remarked, he only said because he was high.  

He complained that I never shut the fuck up, despite having “such an easy life”. I know my life is easy, it just stung. I felt invalid.

He argued “You’re an adult, you wanted to fuck, so we did. You’re emotionally immature.”

The whole time, I believed he liked me, because that’s what he told me. That’s how I justified what I did with him, despite him not being my boyfriend. I felt deceived. Lied to. Even though it seems like everyone who has casual sex doesn’t feel the way that I do.

He refused to give me back my films, telling me to come get them myself. Note: I don’t drive after a traumatic incident with my ex, and it would’ve been humiliating to ask my mom to drive me to his house.

After back and forth arguing and insulting each other, (I brought up how he cheated on his ex and abused drugs - which was so mean of me to say, and he brought up how I was a slut for sending him him racy material) he gave up and agreed to return them.

I texted him “The first night we were at your house, I told you I didn’t want to have sex without a condom, yet you fucked me anyway. Why would you do that?”

Stuart became defensive, arguing that I only brought that up because I was upset at him, that he didn’t remember that night, that I told him myself that he was respectful towards me, that I was “always down“ to have sex without a condom.

To be fair, I did only bring it up because we were arguing. Besides, what kind of girl has feelings for a guy who assaulted her?

Answer: Me, twice.

After my accusation, he blocked me. I felt terrible for what I said during our argument. 

Not to mention - he possibly lied about deleting the pictures/videos he had of me on his phone (he kept his former ex’s photos over a year after the broke up). Those would ruin my career plans. He could get in contact with my ex who might try to hurt me. He could shit talk me to our friends/old coworkers. I couldn’t have him angry with me.

He also was charming, popular, everyone liked him. I was introverted and awkward. I rationalized that I had to be in the wrong, because he was so perfect and put together on the outside.

To add to this, during our argument, he said he pitied me for painting myself as a victim all the time. I did not want to be a victim anymore. I didn’t want the only men I was sexually involved with to have both assaulted me. I didn’t want a complete stranger to have assaulted me. I wanted to believe that he was a good guy who wouldn’t hurt me. After all, I had thought that I really liked him.

Since he blocked me, I used a fake number to apologize to him (my ex used fake numbers to harass me after our breakup, that’s how I got the idea. Crazy, I know). It was a lengthy apology about how I overreacted and that I was the one in the wrong. 

In further attempts to mend the situation, I sent him a gift card and apologized again for my behavior. His girlfriend found out and asked me why I did that. I don’t know why I did. I was just desperate. I lied and told her I was a platonic friend sending him a small gift. I’m sure she assumed I was a girl Stuart was cheating on her with.

Stuart probably thinks he’s some hero who cured my trauma with his dick. He probably thinks I’m a crazy bitch who only pointed out what happened the first night I was over because I was bitter. He doesn’t know that what he did is eating me alive.

I’ve given up on romance. All I’ve gotten from it is pain and self-disgust. I took a chance, and I want to die because of it. I never want to have sex again.

I quit therapy because he was the one who recommended that I try it again in the first place. My therapist told me that I likely had depression and PTSD, but I feel like I’m just immature and too emotional, like Stuart said I was.

There’s nothing I can even do about what he did now. No one would believe me. As far as anyone’s concerned, it was just a relationship gone sour.

I’m worried he already talked shit about me to our old coworkers and friends, because none of them really talk to me anymore. 

I hate the fact that every man I’ve ever been close to has assaulted me or at least attempted to. I feel like a piece of meat. I feel like I deserved it. All of it. I’m so disgusted with myself.

I wish I could call him and scream at him for what he did to me. Then again, I feel like he didn’t really do anything to me, as it was just “casual sex”, and I apologized for accusing him of rape. I can’t take it back.

He got what he wanted, and I’m left to suffer with the questions I ask myself every day, questions I don’t think I will ever have a definite answer for:

After all this, do I even have a right to call it assault? Rape? Abuse? Or, did I deserve it?

It was so easy to recognize that my ex boyfriend was abusive. I was able to talk about what he did to me days after our breakup. With Stuart, even months after our friendship ended, I have doubts on what really happened between us.

&lt;p&gt;He spat on my face and, when I was visibility upset, said “You told me you were into that”. I never told him that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex was excruciating for me, so he’d force me to be quiet when it hurt, because he still lived at home and didn’t want his mom to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I jokingly mentioned the time he fucked me without a condom when I told him not to, he said “You’re making me sound like a predator”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let him film me occasionally with the promise of not recording my face. He recorded my face in the videos. I overlooked this at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote a song for me called “(my name) is a whore/When she comes over/I know I’ll score”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathetically and regrettably, I thanked him for being “more respectful than my ex”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, that’s like thanking your cat for shitting on your tile floor instead of your white polyester sofa, when your cat should be shitting in their litter box. (a classy simile)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, he’d tell me how beautiful I was and how he adored me and how he quit talking to other girls because he was obsessed with me.  He’d ask me for more racy material as he said I “ruined porn” for him. Even though our relationship was sexual, he told me he could play Monopoly with me fully clothed and not have sex and he’d still be perfectly happy, because he loved me as a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought “Whatever happened to no feelings? He’s being more affectionate than my ex”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I left my job because, as it was a failing business, they couldn’t afford to give me more than fifteen hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I continued to have sex with him. I was so desperate to prove to myself that he was the good guy that he said he was. I wanted to believe that he really did care - that I wasn’t cursed romantically and sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d praise him for being such a wonderful guy in an attempt to convince myself that he really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was empowered and having sex on my own terms, because when I told him to stop, he’d stop most of the time, unless he said that my “stop” confused him, because he didn’t know if I was being serious or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried to break things off with him because I equated sex with love and our “no feelings” situation was confusing me, he said he was obsessed with me, but couldn’t commit because I planned on moving away for my career, and he didn’t want to set himself up for heartbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of our relationship, he mentioned several times that his ex was trying to contact him, but he assured me that he was done with her and was ignoring her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he stopped texting me, when we used to text each other daily. Weeks went by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him if he could return the DVD’s I left at his house (Several rare, expensive copies that were valuable to me), and he blew me off and ignored me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a photo of him with his ex on social media. I was enraged. He didn’t even have the guts to tell me directly that he wanted to end things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I angrily texted him to give me back my DVD’s, to delete the photos/videos he had of me, and to never talk to me again. I told him that I couldn’t believe that I thought he respected me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I overreacted, but I felt so hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention I was very upset during this time because my grandmother had died after a long illness where I was her part time carer, and I had lost two close friends of mine recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hope we can be mature enough about this to stay friends”, he responded, after emphasizing that he was “always respectful” towards me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I told him I thought it best if we didn’t speak to each other anymore, he replied “Just trying to be nice”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that I was too emotional and that’s why he got back with his ex without telling me, that I “was always upset about something” so he didn’t want to tell me, reminding me that it was nothing but casual sex with no feelings, that he never really liked me, and I was delusional for thinking that he did. Every nice thing he said to me, he remarked, he only said because he was high.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He complained that I never shut the fuck up, despite having “such an easy life”. I know my life is easy, it just stung. I felt invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argued “You’re an adult, you wanted to fuck, so we did. You’re emotionally immature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole time, I believed he liked me, because that’s what he told me. That’s how I justified what I did with him, despite him not being my boyfriend. I felt deceived. Lied to. Even though it seems like everyone who has casual sex doesn’t feel the way that I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He refused to give me back my films, telling me to come get them myself. Note: I don’t drive after a traumatic incident with my ex, and it would’ve been humiliating to ask my mom to drive me to his house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After back and forth arguing and insulting each other, (I brought up how he cheated on his ex and abused drugs - which was so mean of me to say, and he brought up how I was a slut for sending him him racy material) he gave up and agreed to return them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted him “The first night we were at your house, I told you I didn’t want to have sex without a condom, yet you fucked me anyway. Why would you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuart became defensive, arguing that I only brought that up because I was upset at him, that he didn’t remember that night, that I told him myself that he was respectful towards me, that I was “always down“ to have sex without a condom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I did only bring it up because we were arguing. Besides, what kind of girl has feelings for a guy who assaulted her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: Me, twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my accusation, he blocked me. I felt terrible for what I said during our argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention - he possibly lied about deleting the pictures/videos he had of me on his phone (he kept his former ex’s photos over a year after the broke up). Those would ruin my career plans. He could get in contact with my ex who might try to hurt me. He could shit talk me to our friends/old coworkers. I couldn’t have him angry with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also was charming, popular, everyone liked him. I was introverted and awkward. I rationalized that I had to be in the wrong, because he was so perfect and put together on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this, during our argument, he said he pitied me for painting myself as a victim all the time. I did not want to be a victim anymore. I didn’t want the only men I was sexually involved with to have both assaulted me. I didn’t want a complete stranger to have assaulted me. I wanted to believe that he was a good guy who wouldn’t hurt me. After all, I had thought that I really liked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he blocked me, I used a fake number to apologize to him (my ex used fake numbers to harass me after our breakup, that’s how I got the idea. Crazy, I know). It was a lengthy apology about how I overreacted and that I was the one in the wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In further attempts to mend the situation, I sent him a gift card and apologized again for my behavior. His girlfriend found out and asked me why I did that. I don’t know why I did. I was just desperate. I lied and told her I was a platonic friend sending him a small gift. I’m sure she assumed I was a girl Stuart was cheating on her with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuart probably thinks he’s some hero who cured my trauma with his dick. He probably thinks I’m a crazy bitch who only pointed out what happened the first night I was over because I was bitter. He doesn’t know that what he did is eating me alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given up on romance. All I’ve gotten from it is pain and self-disgust. I took a chance, and I want to die because of it. I never want to have sex again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit therapy because he was the one who recommended that I try it again in the first place. My therapist told me that I likely had depression and PTSD, but I feel like I’m just immature and too emotional, like Stuart said I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing I can even do about what he did now. No one would believe me. As far as anyone’s concerned, it was just a relationship gone sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m worried he already talked shit about me to our old coworkers and friends, because none of them really talk to me anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the fact that every man I’ve ever been close to has assaulted me or at least attempted to. I feel like a piece of meat. I feel like I deserved it. All of it. I’m so disgusted with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could call him and scream at him for what he did to me. Then again, I feel like he didn’t really do anything to me, as it was just “casual sex”, and I apologized for accusing him of rape. I can’t take it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got what he wanted, and I’m left to suffer with the questions I ask myself every day, questions I don’t think I will ever have a definite answer for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this, do I even have a right to call it assault? Rape? Abuse? Or, did I deserve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so easy to recognize that my ex boyfriend was abusive. I was able to talk about what he did to me days after our breakup. With Stuart, even months after our friendship ended, I have doubts on what really happened between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Part I

First of all, I would like to apologize as this is going to be quite lengthy. Buckle up, because what I'm about to say is some pretty wild stuff.

I guess I will start at the beginning of this long and sordid tale. Like so many others, I found myself at the hands and mercy of a family member who decided to teach me the finer points on how to pleasure men when I was 8 years old, and yes I am a male. This abuse happened on a regular basis for quite some time, though this many years later I am kind of fuzzy on the exact length of time, but it wasn't short by any stretch. 

The very first fucked-up thing about this is after a time, I began to like it and look forward to it. I should also mention that during this time my seven-year-old sister was also the focus of some of his attention. Sometimes he even made us play so he could watch, though I only remember this happening a few times. After a while it mainly seemed he was interested in me maybe because after a time I was more receptive than she was.

This went on for a time, and then I remember one day me and my sister were outside playing with these dangerous metal battery powered helicopter toys. Some of you may remember these, it had a red cylinder that you held onto and you put the batteries in with a silver button. This was attached to the little helicopter by steel wire which was very thin, and when you pressed the button the blades would turn quite fast if it had fresh batteries. I learned that you could really tear some shit up with those things... 😁

Anyways, we were just sitting there playing and she all of a sudden just said I think we should go tell Mom about what is going on. For some reason it struck me as being a good idea so after sitting there for some time we went in and we told our mom.

She literally laughed at us.

It took some doing, a bit of screaming and crying on her part, to get my mom to actually start to quote-unquote take this shit seriously. Well, little did I know that she was already cooking up some bullshit. She decided the first thing to do was to take us to the doctor. She did this by lying to my dad and telling him that she thought we may be coming down with the measles. Did he question her? No he did not. Did he go into the examination room with us? No he did not. Did he bother following up with my mom about this? Not to my knowledge. What I do remember, is having a strange doctor shove his fingers up my ass, and then give me a balloon and a piece of candy for my trouble. 

I changed.

I remember the time before all of that happened, and I was a sharp bright brave little boy. I never had trouble talking to the girls, and was well-liked by the other children. And then, through no fault of my own I was scarred, grievously injured in such a way that my young mind could not understand it. I became withdrawn, scared to engage people, lashing out with horrible bouts of rage and anger.  I immediately went to the status of ""that kid."" Did anybody at the private school I went to stop and ask themselves how such a rapid change in a person could occur? No they did not. I began to almost immediately fall victim to bullies, and I became the staffs favorite whipping boy when anything happened even if I had nothing to do with it. I was an outcast, and this had a huge effect on my social skills and development. 

By the time I reached my teenage years, things were very very bad. My social skills were stunted, and had the vitality of a fallout ghoul with a severe case of alopecia. Of course, this shit followed me into adulthood, and wreaked severe havoc and caused even more damage to my already damaged soul. And as logic would dictate, this shit haunts my soul to this very moment, which is also why I'm here. I am genuinely hoping that there is one soul out there, somebody who can help me, because I am very tired now. Do I want to harm myself or others, hell no, I might have my problems but I don't roll like that. Now in the past in earlier years did I consider suicide? Oh yes I did, got close a couple of times too. 

Now we come to the present.

I'm just going to spill it as I see it, because I have no other way to organize it, so I apologize for the monolith of text, but it is necessary because I have to get everything out. And I will also say that I am most certainly willing to answer any questions anyone may have, who knows, it may be helpful.

I'm going to stop part one right here, I think I may be getting close to the post limit, so I will immediately begin part 2 as a reply to this one.",t2_6m0sx66b,False,,0,False,"I need help, bad.",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hcfm92,False,dark,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592655639.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part I&lt;/p&gt;

Also, I’m not actually clinically diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness because I haven’t went to seek help and I don’t even know what I’m feeling and experiencing. 

I come from a society which places a huge importance on education and where there is a huge stigma on mental health issues. I’m 18 and all my life I’ve done extremely well in my academics and people have high expectations of me. Not that anyone forces their expectations on me and makes me stress or anything but I just know they all expect me to do well because I’ve been getting good grades all along. I also have a huge and rather loving family. Amongst my friends, I would say that my life is sort of more “complete” in a sense because I don’t lack anything. I’m not exceptionally close to my family though. To add on, I have few friends in my life and I feel that I can’t actually keep friends. We all seem to just drift apart after some time, especially when we move on to different paths in our lives.

There is absolutely no reason for me to be depressed and I don’t know if I’m actually depressed. I don’t know what I’m feeling and I’m just really confused and helpless. I don’t know how long it has been, maybe 4 or 5 years, but I’ve been feeling super unmotivated to do anything and I’ve always blamed it on me being lazy.  I procrastinate a lot and always find it hard to complete tasks even though I so desperately want to. I find myself to be an extremely sensitive person and I’ve actually been really shy most of my life until these recent few years. 

I’ve always just brushed it off but recently I’m just super lost. I find no purpose in living. I have no goals in life and I have nothing to look forward to. However, i don’t think that I’m suicidal and I would never consider taking my own life but every single day, I just wish to no longer exist. I wish for my life to be taken away and I just don’t want to be here anymore. Living just seems so boring and so tiring. I’m tired of repeating the same cycle everyday and I just wish to never wake up. I’m not afraid of death but I’m afraid of feeling pain. That’s why I have never considered taking my own life.  

These past month was super mentally draining to me especially since school started again. Every single day, I dread going to school. I just breakdown every night and cry for hours for absolutely no reason. During my breakdowns, I feel absolutely helpless and trapped. I feel so suffocated and my mind is just filled with so many things. School drains me more than anything and I find it absolutely tiring. I just don’t want to deal with anything. To add on, I don’t understand why but I’ve been feeling anxious and uneasy every single day for the past few weeks. Maybe it’s because exams are nearing but I’ve never felt this way my whole life. I just feel on the edge all the time. 

I hate that I breakdown and cry every night and I hate feeling anxious all the time. I hate being so unmotivated and I hate that I don’t have a purpose in life. I hate that everyone seems to think I’m okay but I’m actually not. I hate myself because even I don’t understand myself and why I’m feeling like this. I hate that I can’t tell anyone about this because I’m afraid of being an emotional burden. I hate that I’m slowly destroying my life because of my lack of motivation. I hate that I was born into this world. I hate myself for being so ungrateful for all that I have. I just hate the way I feel and I just hate myself so much.

I just feel on the edge all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that I breakdown and cry every night and I hate feeling anxious all the time. I hate being so unmotivated and I hate that I don’t have a purpose in life. I hate that everyone seems to think I’m okay but I’m actually not. I hate myself because even I don’t understand myself and why I’m feeling like this. I hate that I can’t tell anyone about this because I’m afraid of being an emotional burden. I hate that I’m slowly destroying my life because of my lack of motivation. I hate that I was born into this world. I hate myself for being so ungrateful for all that I have. I just hate the way I feel and I just hate myself so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read till here, thank you for reading and for listening. I appreciate it. Sorry for the really long and messy post and for my poor english.&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated university with my bachelor's degree in psychology back in 2014, excelling academically, making Dean's list consistently and earning 'magna cum laude' distinction along with my degree. Up until the end of my time in university, I struggled with a number of mental health issues, including severe social anxiety (to the point where I had to commute instead of staying on campus in student dorms) and depression. Despite all of this, I was always motivated and perhaps a bit too idealistic that all of the hard work I put into my studies would pay off. Needless to say, I was taken aback by how challenging it was to find and secure work in my field after graduation. I had applied for a number of clinical research positions to no avail, as they were seeking someone with prior clinical experience. I had to settle for retail work for some time to make ends meet   before finding a position as a ""counselor"" at a major psychiatric hospital in my area. I use the term loosely, as my position didn't require any formal training (master's degree, etc.) to obtain. In fact, you needed nothing more than a high school diploma to have a fighting chance at this job. With that said, it was a position relevant to my interests so I figured it would serve me well. Unfortunately, I let my anxiety get the best of me here again, as I opted to work overnight shifts, with minimal exposure to patients and aspects of their treatment (exposure-response prevention therapy, de-escalation, check ins about individual well being and so in). And when tasked to assist with helping patients, I would often allow my coworker to handle the task while I completed paperwork at my desk. There have been times I pushed myself outside my comfort zone to connect and offer support with patients, but I found it emotionally draining and overwhelming almost every time. I began to second guess the career path I had chosen, but have great insurance and benefits associated with this job that I just couldn't give up. I've been in this position for just about 5 years now and I think it would be best to move on now, but I simply don't have the motivation or inclination to put forth any more effort. I've resigned myself to the idea that this likely will be my reality for some time to come. I spend my days off sleeping all day as I don't have the energy to confront my situation. I don't even know where to go from here. I was accepted to a master's of counseling program at NYU two years ago, but these plans ultimately fell through as I felt I just wasn't ready. I'm 28 years old, turning 29 next month (in July) and I don't know when or if I'll ever feel ready. Looking back on all of this, part of me questions whether I really put in all this work to get here just to feel validated and accepted or if this was what I truly wanted the whole time. I think my time for introspection is running out and I may be screwed, for lack of a better word.

,depression," I feel pathetic. Everyday. Every damn day. I can’t help it. Most of the times I don’t have a reason as to why I feel disgusting and pathetic and I feel even more sick if I don’t have a reason. I’m tired. So so so so so tired of life. Im tired of living through each day, looking at the same things, sometimes new things but they don’t bother me — all I get is an empty/blank mind. I’m tired of things and people around me as well as myself. I hate the body I was born in. I look disgusting. My skin looks disgusting. My eyes, my hands, my stomach, everything.
Why was I even born? My parents could have had better lives without me: no financial, physical and mental burdens. I feel sorry for them. They fight pretty often. But on the other hand I do sometimes feel annoyed. My father always is shoddy. He is great in terms of work but with family stuff? No. He always uses the excuse: “you’ll get rid of me soon, since I’m already old.” Or “if you dont like me i’ll go away.” Whenever he starts treating me like a straight up baby which doesnt even know the basics of common knowledge. Thats NOT THE DAMN POINT- why can’t he improve to be a proper father? I tell him stuff of the fathers of my classmates who are always volunteering with chores and actively supporting their child. My dad doesn’t  even know what grade I am in with this stupid piano exam. And I have been doing it for years now. Speaking of piano, as much as I love it, I hate it now. I hate everything about it. I hate how I suck at it even after 10 years of practice, i hate how i have to do these STUPID piano exams when I don’t even want to study music, i hate how im always being compared to with other people, etc. I despise it. So, so, so SO MUCH. Apropos my mother, I can never... NEVER cry in front of her. She scoffs and treats me like a delusional, weak person. I had a breakdown with my graduation exams and she looked down at me. Laughed at me and turned her back. “Get yourself together. Stop crying, you’re so weak” is what I was told. Now I subconsciously tell myself the same thing. I can never open up my true feelings. They won’t understand. And trust me I have told them— nothing changed.
I’m sick and tired and pathetic. I’m scared too. I’m scared of dying. I always think: “if i just die... i won’t have to go through this embarrassing life of mines.” 
I work so hard to be good academically but in the end, its all worth nothing. Im not capable of doing anything. Im just a frail, weak child who cried at everything in secret. I’m always comparing myself and being compared to other smart and younger people. I wish I was good at something. But no, I’m not. Im just horrible at everything. I thought that after graduation life will get better but its getting worse. I used to cut and I gave up due to fear of death but now I started again. Im scared. But when I grab the cutter I start crying again and I can’t let go of it. I feel like I deserve it. I deserve all bad things. Nothing good will come out of anything anymore. Its just no use. Nothing helps. When I do cut I feel even more pathetic, like I didn’t cut deep enough.
 “I should cut deeper, this isn’t enough pain. I deserve more pain, I’m a pathetic thing.” 
I try so hard to not talk about it because no one understands.  Sometimes I am happy but it just keeps crawling back to me and reminding me that I’m pathetic and stupid. I don’t want to die yet I still want to kill myself. The main reason I don’t want to leave is that in my next life I will have to go through the same thing again and I don’t want that- I hate this. My mother told me a story that people who commit suicide will be bound to do it again in their next lives. I don’t want that. I want my next life to be happier so I try so hard to be a good person even though I know I’m not a good person. I go out of my way to help people but in the end I still feel disgusting.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry for not having a real reason to be like this. I just can’t help it.

,depression,"Hello, i am 16 years old from Charleston West Virginia and i think i am struggling with depression. I have tried to think of happy things when i get depressed but nothing seems to work. I was hesitant about coming to reddit with this because trolls and stuff but i honestly don't care anymore, my life honestly couldn't get any worse. When i was about 9 years old i was taken from my parents because they were using meth,heroin and Xanax but life seemed pretty good to me because i was only a child. My brother, sister and i were taken to my grandmother house to stay for a while and we were having visits with our parents but then a couple of months after we were living with my grandmother my sister and her got in a argument ending in my grandma slapping my sister down on the floor, so we went on another visit with my parents and told them and our ""visit guide"" Laura who was a total babe and just a cool person to be around lol all about it and we were then moved to my step grandmothers house. She wasn't the best person but she sure as hell didn't slap us. Life was alright living with her and eventually my parents got off the drugs and soon enough we moved back in with them. But to this day they still do Xanax sometimes which tears me the fuck up and i kinda want to fight my dad sometimes but anyway now im in high school and the depression has hit me harder than ever. The only thing that seems to make me happy anymore is my niece who is about 5 months old now and i love her to death and back. I would do anything for this little girl. Before she came along i had thought about suicide every day of my life. I still think about it sometimes but then i see that baby and think how it would make her life in the future, i would never do anything to hurt her but i hurt all the time, i think im slowly losing my mind. My uncle killed himself and i still think about that all the time. I also can't get this girl out of my head, i won't say her name because i don't think i am aloud to, to be honest. But she is perfect in every way, her skin is light brown and as soft as a feather, her hair is puffy like cotton candy and her smile is as beautiful as the sky is blue. I am head over heals for this girl lol. I have been thinking of telling her but i am not sure if she has a boyfriend at the moment. We have flirted back and forth in guitar class a lot. But I'm not sure if she was being serious or not, It wouldn't matter if she really has a boyfriend because im not like that, cuz i know if i had a girlfriend and she cheated on me i would almost certainly commit suicide but that is beside the point. I also hate entitled assholes who have muscle and get nudes by the daily and then go on snapchat and bitch about how they don't get girls, its like no bro that isn't your role. They don't know the struggle, i haven't had a girlfriend since sixth grade and you haven't had a gf for a week and then you come and cry on the internet like honestly stfu. I once posted on snapchat how badly i wanted to die and somehow my school found out, they told me to go to a doctor or something. Im not gonna pay someone to sit in a chair for a half hour and not do anything about my fucking crazy head. I really do think im a psycho sometimes. I have fantasized about taking a gut to my school during a pep rally and making everyone sit down and listen to my problems then i would tell them all to leave and as they were doing that i would shoot myself in the head. I have no intentions on killing anyone for the record, it just doesn't seem interesting to me and it honestly makes me sick, i would never take another life unless they did something unspeakable to my family or my friends.

When i was about 9 years old i was taken from my parents because they were using meth,heroin and Xanax but life seemed pretty good to me because i was only a child. My brother, sister and i were taken to my grandmother house to stay for a while and we were having visits with our parents but then a couple of months after we were living with my grandmother my sister and her got in a argument ending in my grandma slapping my sister down on the floor, so we went on another visit with my parents and told them and our &amp;quot;visit guide&amp;quot; Laura who was a total babe and just a cool person to be around lol all about it and we were then moved to my step grandmothers house. She wasn&amp;#39;t the best person but she sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t slap us. Life was alright living with her and eventually my parents got off the drugs and soon enough we moved back in with them. But to this day they still do Xanax sometimes which tears me the fuck up and i kinda want to fight my dad sometimes but anyway now im in high school and the depression has hit me harder than ever. The only thing that seems to make me happy anymore is my niece who is about 5 months old now and i love her to death and back. I would do anything for this little girl. Before she came along i had thought about suicide every day of my life. I still think about it sometimes but then i see that baby and think how it would make her life in the future, i would never do anything to hurt her but i hurt all the time, i think im slowly losing my mind. My uncle killed himself and i still think about that all the time. I also can&amp;#39;t get this girl out of my head, i won&amp;#39;t say her name because i don&amp;#39;t think i am aloud to, to be honest. But she is perfect in every way, her skin is light brown and as soft as a feather, her hair is puffy like cotton candy and her smile is as beautiful as the sky is blue. I am head over heals for this girl lol. I have been thinking of telling her but i am not sure if she has a boyfriend at the moment. We have flirted back and forth in guitar class a lot. But I&amp;#39;m not sure if she was being serious or not, It wouldn&amp;#39;t matter if she really has a boyfriend because im not like that, cuz i know if i had a girlfriend and she cheated on me i would almost certainly commit suicide but that is beside the point. I also hate entitled assholes who have muscle and get nudes by the daily and then go on snapchat and bitch about how they don&amp;#39;t get girls, its like no bro that isn&amp;#39;t your role. They don&amp;#39;t know the struggle, i haven&amp;#39;t had a girlfriend since sixth grade and you haven&amp;#39;t had a gf for a week and then you come and cry on the internet like honestly stfu. I once posted on snapchat how badly i wanted to die and somehow my school found out, they told me to go to a doctor or something. Im not gonna pay someone to sit in a chair for a half hour and not do anything about my fucking crazy head. I really do think im a psycho sometimes. I have fantasized about taking a gut to my school during a pep rally and making everyone sit down and listen to my problems then i would tell them all to leave and as they were doing that i would shoot myself in the head. I have no intentions on killing anyone for the record, it just doesn&amp;#39;t seem interesting to me and it honestly makes me sick, i would never take another life unless they did something unspeakable to my family or my friends. Anyway i feel terrible every day pretty much and i don&amp;#39;t know how to stop. If you have answers please tell me. Thank you and i love you&lt;/p&gt;

I still feel sad and overwhelmed all the time. I feel like I see all that free space in my schedule for becoming better doing something. I can't even tell you what.

It is like I feel meant for something but I don't know what it is. Everything else just doesn't really feel like anything honestly. I just see my goals and then feel and think through every grueling minute it takes to get there.

I want to lose weight and do sports and learn more shit and develop and socialize. I even know how to get there. But the actual getting there the ""hustle"" isn't at all fun to me.

I have friends and they enjoy doing things. Not just products and outcomes. They like the process. And most things in life just kind of happened to me to lead me where I am now. But I feel like to get further from here I'd need drive and follow through and I don't even know where to conjure that.

I am bored out of my mind. I feel lost and confused and I want a million things but I am paralyzed to start actually achieving anything.

I feel empty and purposeless... Pointless.

I am 30 now and I feel like a failure by my own standards. My standards that measure myself against knowing what I could have achieved if I where capable of putting the work in.

Now the truly horrible thing is that I don't know how to get myself out of it if I am unable to follow through on these promises I make to myself.

How am I supposed to get better when Will itself escapes me?

I am looking for therapy but it's not easy. I have a supportive girlfriend who is good and kind and patient with me.

I have family and friendsi could count on, yet I feel I cant talk to or them bother with how I am feeling. I have a job but it feels horrible because I am deathly afraid of not outgrowing this job quick enough by my own standards or just that I am beneath my own potential. II am afraid that potential is a lie. That I am just not smart or strong enough.

I feel overwhelm with the life I've ""built"" so far and am so afraid of going forward like this.

I feel trapped and hollow and ashamed. And most of all I feel guilty for being so fucking useless while I have some many good things and foundations I could use to better myself.

,depression,"Hi there, thanks in advance for reading :)

My husband is a highly educated professional in a demanding field he has always excelled in. The job has high expectations and long hours but he has always liked his work. He has worked so hard and because of this he was offered an exciting new job a few months at one of the big companies in his industry using some connections and we were really excited about what the future held. 

That being said, my husband has been suffering from mental illness since he was a teen and it has always been something he was in denial about, but for some reason these issues hit him especially hard since beginning this new job.  This has had a major impact on his performance and turned him from the driven, dependable all-star he has always been to a shell of his former self. He misses important meetings, is chronically late due to oversleeping and takes an unreasonable about of time to complete tasks, often missing deadlines altogether. He also has a very negative mindset and sees every day as being terrible. Every single day I say “how was work, what did you work on today?” And every day the answer is something along the lines of “it was shit, I got nothing done” or “it was shit, I made a bunch of mistakes”. If I am anything other than boundlessly positive and optimistic about these comments he becomes angry and cold.  If I voice my concerns he gets more and more upset too which is understandable. 

This has been heartbreaking to see, but after years of encouragement from me he finally agreed to start seeing a therapist. I set up the appointments, paid for them, reminded him of them, etc. All he had to do was show up, which I know is a BIG DEAL, and he did (I am so proud!). There have been 3 sessions in total now and I am so proud of him for taking this step, but it doesn’t seem to be making a whole lot of difference and I am starting to get really worried. He says he doesn’t find it overly helpful?? 

Anyways, he told me he had a meeting with his boss today about some recent deadlines he missed and basically the theme of the meeting was that it can’t keep happening. They are aware of his mental health issues and are willing to accommodate him but he doesn’t know what help to ask for and I think their patience is running out. 

I am terrified he will be fired due to this poor performance. Mostly I am extremely afraid his self esteem will never be able to recover and he won’t get another job and be even more miserable, and we truly cannot afford to lose his income either. And if he is fired for poor performance he will not be eligible for benefits where we live. This puts our financial security at risk (we live somewhat modestly but do have a mortgage etc). 

I want my husband back. I want him to feel fulfilled, confident, satisfied, and proud of himself. I would love for him to be happy. He is an amazing person who deserves this so much. 

A relevant fact here is that he is pretty much estranged from his mother but she is extremely mentally unwell and has had several suicide attempts in recent years, including this year. His best friend is also depressed and has had countless suicide attempts, also in this current year. I live in fear of my husband trying to hurt himself. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation and could offer some tips from the other side? Should I try and convince him to try a new therapist or make more sessions with the current one? Is there anything in particular I can do to be more supportive?

I can’t sleep at night because I am so worried about his health, wellbeing, safety, happiness, and our financial future. He is such a good man and deserves all the happiness in the world. We also want a family but obviously we need to be in good health first, but I am afraid that will never happen. 

Truly any tips or guidance would be endlessly appreciated, thank you!!!

Back when we all went into quarantine, my therapist and I emailed a few times back and forth, to see about setting up sessions online.

,depression,"Hi, I am a 19 years old girl that has been having a crippling deppression that only seems to get worse over time since 13.

At first I thoughn I was just a really sad person, but oh whatever.

I work on a call center, I have not been able to acomplish my dreams, my only boyfriend ever left me (he was the only one because I trusted him and look how that ended up) it has already been 7 months he has already another girl, I have no friends. I talk to boys and then tell them we can't talk anymore because I am not ready for that, I am an EMOTIONAL VAMPIRE.

I hate myself deeply. And I wonder why is it selfish that I take my own life but it is not selfish for them to keep me here because if I die it would be so sad for THEM. Why can't I just go away and die and finally have peace.

&lt;p&gt;I work on a call center, I have not been able to acomplish my dreams, my only boyfriend ever left me (he was the only one because I trusted him and look how that ended up) it has already been 7 months he has already another girl, I have no friends. I talk to boys and then tell them we can&amp;#39;t talk anymore because I am not ready for that, I am an EMOTIONAL VAMPIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself deeply. And I wonder why is it selfish that I take my own life but it is not selfish for them to keep me here because if I die it would be so sad for THEM. Why can&amp;#39;t I just go away and die and finally have peace.&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight, out of no where while laying in bed with my husband and admitting that I havent felt connected to anyone or anything in so long I started crying. I havent cried like this in years. Like everything was coming out. 

It was one of the single most painful cathartic moments in my life. I switched between feeling happy about having feelings, to feeling sad there was so much pain, to being happy I could look at my husband with emotion, to being sad I've been trapped all this time.

I cried for an hour. It felt like it lifted something. But not everything. Like it was a glimpse into how I used to feel.

,depression,"I didn't mean for this to sound funny but I've been trying to find a way to describe how I feel. 

My life feels exactly like I'm a NPC. For those who don't know a NPC is a character from a videogame that is not controlled by a player but has no freedom whatsoever. 

A NPC does the same thing over and over, so much that sometimes doesn't feel like a person but more like a robot. A NPC might be sad or angry but it feels unnatural because he's just following a programming code, he/she is not really sad but just doing what is more acceptable in the specific situation. 

That is my life most of my days I'm not even sad or angry, I'm very neutral to most things. I don't even stress about things because I never leave my routine, I never do other things because I don't think about them. 

I'm breathing, living and that's it. 

I'm not resentful with life or with anyone, and I might even say my life has been good. 

But then it happens something that isn't part of the routine and I just push it down. I haven't cried or been sad enough for the ones who parted before me. 

My promises, my dreams and hopes are nothing but an illusion of something that never existed.

I just relive the same say over and over again, while watching another personality activate when interacting with other people. That is not me. I have no idea who i am anymore. I can&amp;#39;t even kill myself properly. I don&amp;#39;t wanna go on. I keep hurting everyone around me. I am just a placeholder or replacement anyways. The third choice, the one that is mostly just &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;. nothing would change if i was gone. I just get fucked over and over by the world. I know that i am being used by a lot of people, bcs apparently i am good at listening to people who need to vent. And that&amp;#39;s great, but they could find other people. I am just tired of this stuff. I feel like i am watching my body existing. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel like i am alive. I am tired of this world and of the people in it. It&amp;#39;s actually fucked that good people get fucked over for being nice. I hate it&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
Its effected the way i look at life

That why im kinda okay with it


It makes me so self aware or something




And ive always found life

And the world unimportant


Like there are like


Spiritual things way more important


And like the universe

And eternity shit

Time shit

And mind shit

Im probably talking bullshit

And probably bc im mentally ill

But i don’t care

And it will maybe change bc borderline make you change the way you think alot

I feel like

I shouldn’t believe this

Bc I actually think

There is nothing more to than just this

But something makes me believe this now

And I don’t care about life

So im just gonna believe en do whatever i want


Bc all of this isn’t worth anything

Like actually psychical life


And even if there wasn’t spiritual things


I don’t care bc life isn’t worth anything
  

Its just how i feel


Iknow it sounds crazy

Iknow 

I am aware 

But idc


The way i see life


There will never be a reason to think otherwise


Im doing the things i want


Bc i don’t care

Even if thats doing nothing all day


Bc it doesn’t matter


Bc doing things I don’t want isn’t living the life the way i want


Bc nothing really matters and is i guess good enough for me everything is boring


Everything feels empty sometimes 

I just found out i have alot of symptoms of dissociating  i never realized it wasn’t normal 

Sometimes i kinda feel things and i forget, im distracted of how i feel

And when i’m alone i can understand myself better and that feels good i hate being around people sometimes 


Especially lately maybe its just a bad few days but thats how i feel now and i feel it very deep 


It must mean something 


I just wish i was never born


These feelings are very complicated and weird 


Its just not worth it to even live while this is how i feel bc nothing will ever be fun


But i also never want to feel different bc i feel this so deep its kinda comforting 

Also when i feel and think alot about this i forget any other feelings and forget how i felt before this 


But iknow I feel this way all the time but i just kinda forget about it bc im distracted and than i forget about the feeling I actually feel or something 


I have to do so many things i need to be in a different mind state for but I can’t and I don’t want to bc i would hate it either way

There is no way out


I need to go to school and work at the daycare don’t think i can handle that. Its something I don’t want to do but i have to do so i wish i wanted to do it and they deserve it bc they are people who want to help me but i can’t have help 

I can’t ga any other way bc i will hate life everyway 


There is now way out for me bc I don’t want to think any other way but also i need to think different bc i will fuck life up and it will be boring and then there isn’t anything to like about life there still isn’t anymore but later it will be even worse 

Bc i give no effort bc im lazy and i don’t think its worth it bc i don’t want to i do things I don’t want to do and i know that sounds so dumb but I can’t think any other way bc nothing matters so why would i even do things I don’t want


I  can’t explain it 


Its just too much or something but i need it and I don’t want to have help with not thinking this way bc I don’t think its worth it I can’t help it 



The only way out is dying 


But i’m too scared to kill myself 


Iknow this sounds stupid but I decided to believe a few videos its so stupid iknow i sounds stupid but nothing matters and if those videos give me a little hope for dying i guess i will take it 


So I won’t be afraid to die or kill myself 


 But still afraid to kill myself 



i wish i wasn’t 



I know i sound maybe so crazy for people who don’t look at it my way and im just crazy but I don’t care why would life be important to me


You die there isn’t really anyway of it even ever meaning something and I don’t even need it to mean something bc it just doesn’t either way




I wished i wanted help to think otherwise 


But I don’t want to bc this is actually how it is nothing can change my mind 



The only way out is dying 


But im too scared 


Im living in a endless loophole of agony


Im glad im distracted sometimes but still its always the way its gonna be.",t2_6zel298f,False,,0,False,Idk just wanted to share,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hce7zx,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592649456.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its effected the way i look at life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That why im kinda okay with it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me so self aware or something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ive always found life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the world unimportant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like there are like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual things way more important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like the universe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And eternity shit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time shit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And mind shit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im probably talking bullshit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And probably bc im mentally ill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i don’t care&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will maybe change bc borderline make you change the way you think alot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t believe this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc I actually think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more to than just this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something makes me believe this now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t care about life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So im just gonna believe en do whatever i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc all of this isn’t worth anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like actually psychical life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if there wasn’t spiritual things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care bc life isn’t worth anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its just how i feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iknow it sounds crazy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iknow &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But idc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way i see life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will never be a reason to think otherwise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im doing the things i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc i don’t care&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if thats doing nothing all day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc it doesn’t matter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc doing things I don’t want isn’t living the life the way i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bc nothing really matters and is i guess good enough for me everything is boring&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything feels empty sometimes &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just found out i have alot of symptoms of dissociating  i never realized it wasn’t normal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes i kinda feel things and i forget, im distracted of how i feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when i’m alone i can understand myself better and that feels good i hate being around people sometimes &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially lately maybe its just a bad few days but thats how i feel now and i feel it very deep &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must mean something &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish i was never born&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These feelings are very complicated and weird &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its just not worth it to even live while this is how i feel bc nothing will ever be fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i also never want to feel different bc i feel this so deep its kinda comforting &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when i feel and think alot about this i forget any other feelings and forget how i felt before this &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But iknow I feel this way all the time but i just kinda forget about it bc im distracted and than i forget about the feeling I actually feel or something &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to do so many things i need to be in a different mind state for but I can’t and I don’t want to bc i would hate it either way&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I apoligize if there is a better subreddit for this but I need help.

I will do my best to make a long story short.

I am 26, I have struggled deeply with depression and anxiety. It has hindered me severely and I just finally started to get my shit together. I take medication, I (before covid) saw a therapist weekly, I was finally able to face the day and handle my depression (yay)

My mother however, has not. She has severe depression and is too stubborn to take care of herself. She has been in and out of the hospital since I was 19 for alcohol related diseases. Got sober for 2 years, and started drinking again. Today I called her (I call my parents every day. I live 30 mins away and visit about every 2 weeks) to tell her how proud I was of myself that I did very well on my accuplacer test to go to community college after 9 years of being out of school and having shitty dead end jobs and wallowing in my own self pity. But she sounded very fucked up. Perhaps drunk but more
... opiate downer type of fucked up and she informed me she has pancreatitis again and the doctor wants her to go to the hospital immediately but she refuses.

My father had never gone to a doctor since before I was even born. Last year the pain got to be too much and I convinced him to go. He did, and he has been a trooper ever since going to his cancer treatments. He starts radiation next week. 

There is much more to this but I'm trying to not write a novel.

I love my parents but I feel so alone in this.
 They are both very ill and I know through therapy that they are grown adults and I have no control over their decisions if they refuse to hear my input. However, perhaps I'm being selfish, I am trying very hard to overcome depression and live my best life but I feel that phone calls and visiting is not enough. I dont know what to do anymore, my depression has come back full force today and my thoughts will not stop racing with thoughts of how my parents will die before I get married, have a baby, yadayada. I dont want to lose them. I dont know how to take care of them. My head is spinning. I need help.

,depression,"My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.",t2_vmwwp1m,False,,0,False,"My life has been a mess for years and I don't know what to do anymore, please help me.",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hce2sj,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592648837.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life has been a mess for as long as I&amp;#39;ve been alive, but this&amp;#39;ll be long enough as it is so I&amp;#39;ll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90&amp;#39;s rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn&amp;#39;t hear her but someone yelled out &amp;quot;wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom&amp;quot; so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn&amp;#39;t know, she didn&amp;#39;t have plans, she just didn&amp;#39;t wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn&amp;#39;t even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn&amp;#39;t even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn&amp;#39;t wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don&amp;#39;t wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn&amp;#39;t my fault, I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven&amp;#39;t gotten anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, and I don&amp;#39;t think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

It was almost as if I had returned to the same spot that I was at in high school. Like there wasn't really a change in routine. 

I think that even when I was in grade school I would use video games as an escape from life. I still play video games now but I have been shying away from them because whenever I play them, all they ever seem to do is make me angry.

I seriously can&amp;#39;t remember a time in my life when this wasn&amp;#39;t the case, no matter what the circumstances have been. &lt;/p&gt;

The other hallucination he had was during his sleep. His vision included a demon-like figure that was hovering above him and his body was jerking up and down rapidly. A very supernatural seeming experience by his description.

,depression,"I [26M] have been battling my depression since I was young, diagnosed when I was 16 and got on meds when I was 19. Stayed on the meds for 2 years and what I learnt was, I could control the depression when I saw signs of it coming (like the really bad states, you know?). Things like; elevated mood in the morning followed by utter disgust with myself and my life because I spilt some coffee on my shirt, the normal stuff right? Well, a lot of this changed when I met my wife to be. I do NOT promote codependency as I believe we all should learn to love ourselves, but wow did she save me. The overwhelming positivity she has for life seemed to counteract my relentless pessimism and depression. 

A quick aside: I moved from Australia to live in England which is where I met my wife. After dating for a short time (3 months) she informed me that her family was moving to the US. Young and in love I decided I had no reason not to join her, so I moved over to follower her. I started studying college here which allowed me to stay...for now.

Well fast forward, we got married and soon after started a family, a beautiful boy. This was all seemingly fine as I had a good job after graduating from an A.S. But alas, will all steps in my life it seemed to be fruitless. I couldnt qualify for a work visa and so I had to either leave the country, or reenroll in school. I chose the latter obviously and sadly we had to move back in with the in laws. 
If there is anything worse for depression, its stripping someone of all their I dependence, their privacy and freedom to use money. 
We are now expecting baby number 2. I know what you're thinking, ""idiots, why?"" We had it a planned out believe it or not. She was about to receive citizenship and then I could legally apply for my permanent residency. Then...covid. Now throughout this time my mental state has been gradually decreasing. I slowly isolated my self, lost the ability to smile and joke around and then finally and most detrimentally lost my sleeping and eating patterns. 

When I wasnt a parent, this behaviour was unacceptable. Now that I'm a parent, it's a fucking joke. I am so stressed, so petrified that I am going to mess my children up. Not only because their father is unable to care for himself, but he snaps at them and expects way too much. 
I am so shit that I get mad at my 16month old son that he doesnt listen to me....he's a fucking infant, what's wrong with me? 
People are now commenting on my behaviour all the time, like I control this fucking disease. ""Why not have fun?"" ""Why doesnt he talk?"" ""How does he sit in the room all day?"" Because I'm fucking depressed!!! 
My wife asks me to describe why I can't try harder and don't blame her, but I replied like this. ""You know when your shoe gets caught in the mud, you try to pull it out but it begins to pull your shoe off? Well inside my mind is the depression (the mud) pulling all the happiness and rational thought straight off/out (the shoe). You cant just rapidly pull out of it, or you're left without a shoe. So, you stand in it and wait and hope slowly pulling it out will fix the issue."" But this time...it hasn't fixed it. 

To cap this all off. We think we now have to move back to England, which I'm happy about (the US is not for me, no offense) but I am scared to death. How am I going to provide for my family? How can I afford rent? They basically wont give two shakes about my US degree, it's not useful to them. How have I done this? How have I messed it up this bad. Why am I always such a friggen failure? How can I fail my family like this?

Things like; elevated mood in the morning followed by utter disgust with myself and my life because I spilt some coffee on my shirt, the normal stuff right? Well, a lot of this changed when I met my wife to be. I do NOT promote codependency as I believe we all should learn to love ourselves, but wow did she save me. The overwhelming positivity she has for life seemed to counteract my relentless pessimism and depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick aside: I moved from Australia to live in England which is where I met my wife. After dating for a short time (3 months) she informed me that her family was moving to the US. Young and in love I decided I had no reason not to join her, so I moved over to follower her. I started studying college here which allowed me to stay...for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well fast forward, we got married and soon after started a family, a beautiful boy. This was all seemingly fine as I had a good job after graduating from an A.S. But alas, will all steps in my life it seemed to be fruitless. I couldnt qualify for a work visa and so I had to either leave the country, or reenroll in school. I chose the latter obviously and sadly we had to move back in with the in laws. 
If there is anything worse for depression, its stripping someone of all their I dependence, their privacy and freedom to use money. 
We are now expecting baby number 2. I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;quot;idiots, why?&amp;quot; We had it a planned out believe it or not. She was about to receive citizenship and then I could legally apply for my permanent residency. Then...covid. Now throughout this time my mental state has been gradually decreasing. I slowly isolated my self, lost the ability to smile and joke around and then finally and most detrimentally lost my sleeping and eating patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wasnt a parent, this behaviour was unacceptable. Now that I&amp;#39;m a parent, it&amp;#39;s a fucking joke. I am so stressed, so petrified that I am going to mess my children up. Not only because their father is unable to care for himself, but he snaps at them and expects way too much. 
I am so shit that I get mad at my 16month old son that he doesnt listen to me....he&amp;#39;s a fucking infant, what&amp;#39;s wrong with me? 
People are now commenting on my behaviour all the time, like I control this fucking disease. &amp;quot;Why not have fun?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why doesnt he talk?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How does he sit in the room all day?&amp;quot; Because I&amp;#39;m fucking depressed!!! 
My wife asks me to describe why I can&amp;#39;t try harder and don&amp;#39;t blame her, but I replied like this. &amp;quot;You know when your shoe gets caught in the mud, you try to pull it out but it begins to pull your shoe off? Well inside my mind is the depression (the mud) pulling all the happiness and rational thought straight off/out (the shoe). You cant just rapidly pull out of it, or you&amp;#39;re left without a shoe. So, you stand in it and wait and hope slowly pulling it out will fix the issue.&amp;quot; But this time...it hasn&amp;#39;t fixed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cap this all off. We think we now have to move back to England, which I&amp;#39;m happy about (the US is not for me, no offense) but I am scared to death. How am I going to provide for my family? How can I afford rent? They basically wont give two shakes about my US degree, it&amp;#39;s not useful to them. How have I done this? How have I messed it up this bad. Why am I always such a friggen failure? How can I fail my family like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the disorganized thoughts...I have probably missed out on a lot of what I wanted to say as well, the mind gets that way when your depressed and havent eaten because you forgot...&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm just gonna write this down without thinking about it, I can't take this all for myself anymore

I've had depression twice in my life, one diagnosed and one that I've took alone, and I'm 19y/o

I know I shouldn't give any importance to this problems, cause a lot of worst things will come in life, I try to focus on that but I just can't anymore.. all I want is for everything to fucking end.

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years now, and her parents are the only people I've ever felt hatred towards in my life.. they treat her below shit, they have all life, she has dozens of scars on her body because of everything she's been through.
We both live in a small town in Portugal, she lives on my street, 3 houses apart, and she doesn't enter my house in almost an year at this point. We have to have sex in abandoned homes, or find any other crazy solutions at the little time she has alone. 
She works for them in a small cafe at our home town, she's been there since summer 2018, and things have just gone worst every single day.

They never paid her 1 cent. She opens the cafe every single day (no days off, last time she had one was last summer.) at 7am, alone, cleans, prepares everything for the day, does everything til the hour her parents wake up (they never set up an alarm, they sleep how many hour they want), that's usually close to 10:30/11:00AM, they go down to the cafe, she has to prepare lunch for the 3 of them, always, no chance for switching, while they sit on the fucking chairs doing go knows what. When a client shows up they call her (this also happens while their behind the counter), so she has to leave the lunch, come from the kitchen, do their job at the counter, receive the payment, and go back to slavery.

She can't get out of the house. She stays at the cafe from 7AM to 11PM (only because of Covid-19, before it was close to 2/3AM, without breaks in between) all she wants to do afterwards is to sleep, she doesn't even look at her phone while she's at home, this has been going on for an year. She can't get another job because they threaten to kick her out and she has absolutely no money, place to stay, anything in her name, anything, she's a complete fucking slave.

I don't know what I can do anymore, all I can see everyday is their face, happy, laughing, eating the food she makes them, making jokes about the situation, all I want I wanna do is kill them.
I got a job for this summer, If I rationalise my money at the point of not buying anything except food and hygiene I'll have close to 2k by the end of the summer (have some money I gathered from random 1 day jobs and last summer's job) but how will I get her out of this hell, of this fucking town with 2k? I'm completing high school in a couple of weeks, I have dream grades, no going to college with the opportunity I have would be a crime.

I just don't know what I can do anymore, I've been drowning this in drugs, alcohol, anything I can get inside to forget that I'm still here, only because she couldn't take it if I did it once and for all, I think about it more and more every single day, I lost so many people because of these thoughts, of this situation, from life friends to family, I can't remember most of this year cause I was sober from everything only for a couple of weeks, I don't even know myself anymore, I want the old me, I want everything back, I wanna talk and not explode, I wanna be sober from everything but I can't

,depression,"Hello Reddit.

(M/17) Yesterday, I visited a psychiatrist who said that I have probably a Bipolar Disorder with a current Severe Depression. (I had 1x ""Hypomanic"" episode  and a Severe Depression in 2018/2019) My last ""Hypomanic"" episode was a month ago and after that my mood was getting worse and worse.

Is this normal or do I have a big problem?

It's my fault I allow them to but I like being able to be an outlet for them. Anyways...I grew up in a very strict Muslim home and from a very young age I've been questioning religion and at the age of 23 I decided I'm not going to follow religion. Parents don't know but can clearly see I'm not a fan. Yet they keep forcing down religion down my throat. Not to mention I'm a closeted gay so I've just been holding an entire part of me back for years. It's fucked me up mentally just not being able to express myself how I genuinely want to and always having to think how I will come across. I honestly feel like I'm still mid teens even tho I'm mid 20. They allow my brother to be free but always force this Muslim shit on me. Always making comments how I'm looking like a sheikh or like I'm an Arab trying to force this ideal on me to want to be like that. My dad is like a ticking time bomb with anything always ready to pop off and argue about anything. He has never apologized about anything he's said to anyone in this house. He literally told my brother that he will cut off his head because he tried to stop my dad from fighting my uncle. I've literally gotten beaten up when I was a teen because my dad didn't think I put enough effort in a project about religion even when I scored high on it. He's just a piece of fucking shit. Loves to act like he's not an ass when he's with other people. I don't have friends near to my home so I'm usually on my PC talking via a call or something. And my dad had a huge problem with that. He hates to see me on my computer even though he lives behind his phone 24/7 and only uses his earbuds when he watches porn like if he's fooling anyone. I have horrible sinus allergies. This morning I woke up feeling like shit because I slept with my fan on a speed higher than one because it was hot last night. I just ate and took some meds and went back to sleep. I didn't even realize today is Friday and we have to go to mosque. Had I known I would have just toughed it out because as I said he's a time bomb and you know he's a saint in his eyes because he prays. I woke up to him shouting at my mom because she saw me sleeping when it was time to leave and he went off on this huge argument about how I'm always on the computer late at night and why don't I love to pray one a bunch of other shit. It's so fucking depressing to be surrounded by people who don't and will never accept who you truly are (meaning in the house not my friends) and I get so fucking jealous when I see gay kids and my friends being able to live how they want and not have to be forced to live a certain way or follow a certain religion. Everyone just wants me to be my brother. They want me to be muscular and handsome and look like a Muslim and have all the girls after me and have a job and be charismatic. I know everyone will say I'm 26 I can leave but it's not possible for me right now. I've fucked up my life and I'm trying to un fuck it but it's not getting better.

Anyways...I grew up in a very strict Muslim home and from a very young age I&amp;#39;ve been questioning religion and at the age of 23 I decided I&amp;#39;m not going to follow religion.

Not to mention I&amp;#39;m a closeted gay so I&amp;#39;ve just been holding an entire part of me back for years. It&amp;#39;s fucked me up mentally just not being able to express myself how I genuinely want to and always having to think how I will come across.

Ive been diagnosed with a digestive disease called Ulcerative Colitis. It has made my life hell. Long story short I’ve been shitting blood and having so much stomach pain in the past few months. 

Today, I finally managed to find a place that would do an exam called Colonoscopy. That is there they send a camera up your rectum to find the cause of the bleeding.

The problem is they require someone to sign me out of the hospital. I HAVE NO ONE. No friend. No family. 

I want to emphasis just how hard it is to:

A). Find a place that does it at an affordable price

B). Just how badly I need this exam

Therefore, I cannot cancel the exam. That’s out of the question. Question is, how do I find someone to sign me out of hospital?

Obviously there’s a reason behind this policy (for the smartasses who’ll be commenting). But, this really puts pressure on people who have no one to help them.

,depression,"I woke up in a terrible mood, still suction cupped to my bed until I absolutely had to go to work.

On my walk there, in and out of panic attacks, someone almost hit me with a car on the sidewalk.

Got to work shaking, feeling slightly manic, not sure if I should even be into work today.

I got right into it - sanitizing everything, cleaned the bathroom, swept all the floors and started organizing part of the store I haven't touched yet - the utility closet.

I'm the new manager here so the utility closet, the smoke room and the basement are still places I want to whip into shape (and one employee...oh well).

Suddenly the person that owns a live music place next door offered me a job. I won't take it - last time I worked at a place that served alcohol, I ended up picking glass out of a co-worker's skull. He had to get 18 stitches and my ptsd just can't take it but it was really nice that he thought that I would be a good fit.

So after that confidence boost (cuz people see the work I'm doing and want me to also work there? that's so nice) I found purpose in bringing up all the old furniture in the basement that everyone else is afraid of.

I've made $15 already for the store and found a huge mirror that I gave myself a pretty good deal on.

Then the person that took most of the furniture happened to live upstairs from the shop. He said that he runs several businesses and can already see that cleaning his giant apartment is going to be a problem for him.

Boom, scored a job I'd do once every few weeks for a little extra cash and/or weed. I also freakin LOVE cleaning. That's all I am going to do tomorrow at my own place.

I suppose these instances themselves didn't turn my day around. I realized whilst typing this out that I am in such a place in my life and mental health that all the little things I do for myself day to day really helped to boost my happiness over the last 24 hours.

Every time I'm doing well, I do everything I possibly can like premaking something simple to warm up over the next few days, etc, just in case depression hits and I can't take care of myself like I should.

Idk, I guess I just wanted to post an update because yesterday I thought this bout was going to last for weeks the way it felt. But I think I'm breaking free from it already.

Remember, even though it sounds empty until you can feel it for yourself but things can get better.

,depression,"So these past few weeks I've been getting extremely frustrated with my girlfriend, every time she opens her mouth I hate what comes out. It's usually something she thinks is funny or something. She ALWAYS says stuff but then like changes it later, but then she said I should never listen to her, but she gets mad when I say one or the other. Like she never takes care of her teeth, and every time I say she never brushes her teeth she gets offended but sometimes says she doesn't. But today she finds out she had gum disease. She is immature and irresponsible, but I know I am too, I am irresponsible, but I feel more responsible. Sometimes I feel like our relationship is bad, but I don't know what I'd do without it. She can be suicidal and I feel like If I left her she'd do something. But I love her, but I need her to grow up. I need her to keep myself from cutting, I need her for comfort, I need her because she is everything I have, I need her because she is my best friend. I know I'm a shit person for feeling this way, but I have trouble caring when my girlfriend talks about why she is sad because it doesn't make sense to me, it's not rational, but I know that that's not nice. she sometimes tells me that she and her parents 'notice' something I did that was rude, but lately every time she opens her mouth I get pissed. She had amazing parents who she could talk to and they'd listen. She is always sad but only because of me. I get so jealous of her life even though she had depression longer. She is the one who tried to commit suicide many times, several during our relationship. I get angry and feel like she is selfish for not appreciating the good she has. My parents are divorced and my mom is a bitch to my dad. My mom leaves every day to be with her boyfriend, and my girlfriend knows my mom is bad. She hates her more than I do  


Last week I got the news my grandpa passed away. I was told it was swelling or a clot, but during the funeral, I found out he shot himself. I found out he was struggling with the same problems as me. He was annoyed at his wife, he was annoyed at the world. I know I am just like my grandpa, he wrote down every symptom, every medication he took, and every problem it had, he would be horrified of every shot he got, ask his wife if it was red or swollen, or crawling bugs.... when I learned that, I knew I was just like him. I write down all my symptoms, I write down the concerns I have about my relationship. I wish I could have talked to him before he died. I could have helped, we could have helped each other. My dad lost his dad and now his wife (my stepmom) is in the hospital barely hanging on. She had a few seizures earlier this year but the doctors overlooked it. When they got to TN to be with my grandma, she had non stop seizures and is in the hospital. She missed the funeral and her kidneys are starting to fail. They don't know why, and my dad is worried. My dad won't be back for another 2 weeks or until she gets out of the hospital. I lost my friends when I moved with my girlfriend to another school. I feel like our relationship is extremely toxic but I can't let her go.

I talked to the crisis text line and pretty much just said the same stuff, but even after repeating it, I feel no better. I can't afford any more doctors or psychological help. I'm stuck, and I just want to slit open my wrists and watch them bleed for hours. But I want to wake up the next day and do It all over again.

,depression,"Hey everyone,

So my mom’s father died 18 months ago and her sister has been suffering from stage 4 cancer and is in pretty bad shape too. Naturally, she’s very beat up about this and has been consistently exhibiting signs of severe depression since my grandfather’s death. Although I’m in the US, our ethnic/family culture stigmatizes mental health and it would be rude of me to straight up tell her to see a therapist or something.

Furthermore, I’m not very good with this sort of thing because I have a very low emotional intelligence. I really want to do something for her because the atmosphere in our home and my parents’ marriage has been horrible over the past year and I just want to make her smile for once. It’s been so painful watching her cry every day. Even the things I pushed myself to do that would make her so happy no longer affect her.

Sorry for the sob story, but my question is, how can I help her? Is there any way for me to schedule some consultation or appointment for her or do something else?

,depression,"My experience with doctors, medication, and therapy have all been negative since I started trying to get help.

Every time I see my doctor, I end up waiting an hour. When I finally see him and try to explain what's going on, he cuts me off and says that he only has five minutes. All he needs to know is if I need a new prescription. I tell him that the medication isn't working, that it's making me too drowsy and I'm feeling worse. He just tells me to take more before leaving the room. I'm not his target demographic, and it shows. He only cares about seniors, babies, and women who want children/are pregnant. There are times where I think he's getting paid by companies to promote certain medications. He always tries to push the newest brand name products on me that cost hundreds of dollars.

Every medication that I've tried doesn't work. It doesn't change anything for the better. They just make me drowsy to the point that I'm a zombie and even more mentally fragile because I'm even more tired 24/7. I get withdrawal symptoms every time. More headaches. More irritability. More exhaustion and despair.

Every therapist that I've been to has made me feel like I should just end it and save everyone time. The drop-in therapists that I've seen all told me that I don't have real problems. They told me that wishing people cared about me is selfish, and that they all have bigger problems to worry about rather than me whining about non-issues. The multi-session therapists I've seen just tell me to be grateful for what I have, which just translates into me being ungrateful. They tell me that I should meditate and go for walks. Yeah, because I can *totally* meditate in a home environment where I have no privacy, and where trying to have some peace and quiet by myself is impossible. And sure, I can *totally* go for a walk when I feel anxious from just being in a public space, and I can *definitely* exercise when I have zero energy at the start of the day.

It's all pointless. It doesn't help. I just feel worse. All of this just proves that I don't deserve to be happy, and that I need to just shut up and accept my place in life. I'm never going to be loved. I'm never going to be cared about. I'm just someone to fill space until someone better comes along. I'm just someone for people to take their anger out on.

,depression,"Hello everyone. I never wanted to talk about my life in a place like this but this is my last chance I guess. I am normally a person who can manage to throw it in and forget about it. But everything has been filled up in me to the point that I'm even crying while writing these lines haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try my best to keep everything tidy and short for you but it will still most likely be a long read. I apologize in advance. And if you feel like my problems aren't actually that big, I can't blame you, I'm also aware that there are people that goes under much more stuff and still manage to stay strong. The thing is, I'm not that strong.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next two paragraphs I will be giving some context and tell you how I got into this position. So I'm a male. If this was a year ago, I wouldn't even consider calling myself depressed or problematic at all. I was a great student in my school, I had really nice friends that would always support me and be on my side. But since the end of the last summer, my life is becoming progressively worse. I have always been a calm and quiet person. But I wasn't the socially gifted type. The reason for that is because my childhood wasn't the most pleasurable experience, if anything, it was damaging.

At the beginning of the 12th grade, everything was completely fine. All I had to do was to study for university exams, and I was keeping my grades really steady. I wasn't in a relationship, nor that I was desperately searching for one. But around December I got a girlfriend, who was already a good friend of mine for a long time. And she was perfect. I couldn't think of being with anyone else at all and even the thought of losing her was immensely painful. For a few months everything was mostly fine. My grades were still good. Our relationship was decent even though we would argue sometimes. But as time passed on, the things didn't go very well. My grades dropped fast, Our arguments got much worse, and my family was nagging me A LOT. And in the end she broke up with me, all because of my stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in a position that cannot be fixed at all.  Literally next week, I have a university exam I have been studying for a year and I am not prepared at all. In fact, I was more ready at the beginning of the year compared to now. And I don't even care to be honest. I have no drive to do anything. All the life energy in me feels like got pulled out completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationship between me and my family is getting worse too. My dropping grades was the cause at first. Then they started to get offended by my simplest actions and most innocent words (One example would be when I told my dad calmly that I didn't enter an online exam because no one else was entering either. He didn't talk to me for more than a week.). And recently I don't have any appetite, and don't feel like eating anything. This also causes my family to pressure me even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt like a person that could support other people when they need help (mostly because of my asocial background.). That's why I never talked about my feelings, since I didn't want people to provide me something that I couldn't return them back. But this never felt like a problem until this year. I was so weak at supporting my girlfriend that it would hurt our relationship more than anything. And not just that, but I also offended and hurt both my closest friends and my cousin (Who is literally like a big brother for me.) on the smallest things on multiple occasions. I should also say that this was the first time in my life that I ever offended my cousin. I tried to get better at social interactions but I f\*\*ked up really hard. 6 months passed and I only started to improve at my social skills recently. But it doesn't even matter anymore since I lost both my girlfriend and people around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel like my words don't have any effect on people unless I degrade them, swear at them, or simply talk bad to them. Whenever I apologize to people, say I feel sorry for them or say that I feel guilty for what I've done and I will take responsibility, no matter how sincere I am, they tell me that this is not enough and that they expect me to be more understanding. I do my best to encourage people, make them feel better, and make them laugh, but all my attempts seem to be unsuccessful. Due to this, I feel like everyone thinks that I'm the worst person alive. Whenever I tell someone something they interpret it in the worst way possible. And even when I thoroughly explain myself, it seems to have no effect on how they interpret my words.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I want to talk to someone about something that bothers me, either I get snubbed, or rebuffed. And when I try to make things better by saying stuff like ""Don't worry, It isn't that important actually, It doesn't bother me that much, I don't mind"" then they scold me for how I talk. I never felt much more weak in explaining myself ever before.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved life. I loved everything about it. The sounds of birds in the morning, crickets chirping at night, going for a swim in summer and drinking a hot tea in the winter... I can count lots of things that would  have made me happy. Now none of these makes me happy at all and I wish my life would just end instantly. I hate myself for saying these but I seriously want it to end. The only problem is that I am not courageous (or stupid, whichever way you want to interpret it) enough to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

,depression,"I walked into my parents room as they were half asleep, and asked for a therapist. They kept asking if I was okay and if I wanted to talk, but honestly I don’t ever see myself opening up to them. But they agreed to getting me a therapist.


I haven’t really enjoyed life for a long time, as long as I can remember. The cons of life just seem to outweigh the pros, making the logical decision to not be alive, if that makes sense. I can’t because it would hurt my family and close ones, though. I have friends, aspirations, loved ones, but life is just too much. I’m not struggling to get out of bed, at most I have some mild insomnia, I have energy, I have emotions, I honestly wonder if I’m even depressed. I suppose that is why it took me so long to finally get a therapist. I’m glad I finally mustered up the courage to ask, I hope this will make me happy.

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t really enjoyed life for a long time, as long as I can remember. The cons of life just seem to outweigh the pros, making the logical decision to not be alive, if that makes sense. I can’t because it would hurt my family and close ones, though. I have friends, aspirations, loved ones, but life is just too much. I’m not struggling to get out of bed, at most I have some mild insomnia, I have energy, I have emotions, I honestly wonder if I’m even depressed. I suppose that is why it took me so long to finally get a therapist. I’m glad I finally mustered up the courage to ask, I hope this will make me happy. I hope that this won’t make my relationship with my parents too awkward. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Probably in about July or August of last year I started to feel different, not terrible, but consistently only like 90% of normal. It wasn't a big deal because I just started exercising harder and more often, ate healthier, went vegan, started cooking for myself, reading more, spending a ton of time outside, doing well in school, etc. Basically every good thing you could be doing and I felt like a god.

But my parents wouldn't stop making me feel like shit about everything I did. No matter what I did it wasn't good enough and I started to hate coming home from school. I don't want to go into too many details but it culminated with my mum screaming at me as I left the house to go to a Christmas Party. It was so bad that I left an hour early and just sat on the street corner crying waiting for my friend to pick me up and take me to the party. I got completely wasted and don't remember much of the night. I could feel that I had just snapped and immediately felt like shit about everything. Since then I've just felt like garbage probably about 95% of the time.

I've lost all interest in everything I loved, and most of it actually makes me feel worse. Running, swimming, cooking, baking, eating healthy, exercising in general all make me feel worse about myself, but I already feel bad for not doing them. So I'm basically in a constant state of feeling like shit. I really briefly thought about suicide when I was feeling my worst, but I haven't thought about that in a few months.

I haven't been feeling this way for that long (6 months or so) but I hate it so much and I just want it to end. I really want to feel good about myself and life again.

I know this community isn't supposed to be used for specific advice, but I looked into anti-depressants and I just want to know if they might make me feel motivated to care about myself again, because I don't have any motivation and I really want to do those things again and be back to how happy I was when doing everything that I loved.

,depression,"When I was a kid, my mother isolated me (yes I know I was abused). She didn't let me hang out with friends except for at school, she never let anyone come over (I wouldn't want anyone over anyway the house never got cleaned), I wasn't allowed to go over to friend's houses, to their birthday parties, and I had to beg and throw a fit for her to let me talk to my friend over the phone. She told me I wasn't allowed to have friends. I would get embarrassed when friends showed up at my house out of the blue. My mom would get angry and yell and tell me to tell them to go away. 

Now I'm an adult and unfortunately I still live with my mother. I have a boyfriend and no actual friends. I always thought of myself as an introvert. I'm really quiet and can't communicate with people very well. I've been slowly but surely learning how to communicate the best I can.

I value my alone time but I would spend 24/7 with my boyfriend if I could (obviously I don't). On days like today, when I'm off work and my boyfriend is at work, I feel alone and depressed.

,depression,"Hello everybody, 

my close relative has a serious mental health problem for years, she is functional most of the time, underwent a basic therapy and is on medication, but the problem persists, although major drops are somewhat less common (once or twice a week). There are some underlying, possibly related problems accumulated over years, both of psychological and physiological nature, but I do not want to go to details because it could derail the question I want to ask.

Basically, what I am looking for is someone who experienced similar symptoms and I want to ask what was your cause and how (if) did you cope with it. I am not looking for a medical diagnosis (can not be done online), but need a comparison and maybe it could help me to find another approaches to the situation.

Basically, she is in her 30s and experiences major drops of mood without a direct apparent cause. These are usually tied to being tired (like sleeping for less than 10 hours) or to an otherwise minor problem (like being unable to find something). Such preconditions do not launch the drop every time, it more seems like that the drop is present in background some days and waits for any inconvenience that can start it. The drop is accompanied by severe anxiety (""I do not belong here, I feel like in a trap, Everyone hates/should hates me, I am completely unable to do anything, I am doing everythong wrong""), passive aggression (""Say something, You all probably hate me, All the problems are there especially to hurt me, Do you really like living here with me etc.,) and general negativity (like refusing any attempts to being helped because of feeling that it will not work anyway). There is also a sort of tunnel vision - if an everyday problem started it, then she is unable to try a new approach to it and repeats the not working approach with increasing intensity until exhausted. The main phase, if not reinforced by any further negative experience, lasts for about half an hour, but the descent and reconvaslescence are both gradual. What is interesting is, that it is always accompanied by ache of shoulder muscles and increased sensitivity to pain both there and on other parts of body - even a slight touch is felt as painful. 
The condition returns in waves about every other hour, usually disappears for a few days after sleeping.

The medication she receives decreased length of the drops and their frequency, but seems not to work completely and it still comes too often and complicates her finding a job or raising her baby - she can not plan in advance, because any day can be the drop day. When she recovers, she is aware of the problem, but can not really recall how she felt, for example to tell the therapist in detail. She is able to discuss her problems openly otherwise, and sometimes notices that the drop is coming, but can not stop it.

I have never made any decision for myself. I mean a *truly* independent decision. 

Where I went to school.
Who I dated.
Who I married. 
Where I lived.
Where I worked.
Who my friends were.
Never leaving my dreadful home state.

My whole life has been orchestrated for me. First by my suffocating narcissistic parents, then by my well-meaning but psychologically clueless husband. He has never known, and likely never will know, the true extent of my constant suffering.

I feel so insignificant and unimportant.

Many times, I daydream about a one-way ticket out of here and starting fresh. 

Away... FAR AWAY from my toxic family, aimless “friends”, boring boring boring everyday life. 

I realize it’s selfish. I don’t want to leave my child for anything. She is everything. 

My husband won’t let us leave. Ever. 

We are stuck here forever.
I’ll die here.

,depression,"I don't even know where to start. If my loved ones look at me today from outside, my current life will look normal. I am going to get married to my fiance soon. We both are PhD students, earning decent stipends, have two pets, a healthy social circle and no major debts till date. I sometimes feel lucky to have my fiance who takes care of most of the stuff for both of us, like cleaning home, cooking, taking care of the cats (he has been working from home much before the lockdowns started). 

For me, there are days after days when I feel like I am just somehow clinging to this normal lifestyle, mostly because of my fiance. On the other hand, I feel sorry I have to make my fiance go through all this alone. I can sense he loves me but he definitely has some resentment. Our sex life is a mess, thanks to me. We hardly have any conversation, thanks to me. I hardly get up and do something wonderful for him. Sometimes I wish he could courage up and just leave me. He deserves way better life than one he is spending with me. I am not even courageous to break up with him because I love him too much and I am afraid if he leaves, that will be it for me. It frustrates me that I can't make him happy because of all this darkness inside me.

I didn't have a decent childhood or teenage years. I have seen my parents fight, even physically, throughout my life. I have been a victim of corporal punishment for smallest mistakes I would make because my parents themselves were depressed and frustrated. I have received beatings for which I still carry scars on my body and still have nightmares.  I have always been a bright child and would excel in academics and extra curricular activities. I decided to devote my life to academics, as it seemed to me the only way I got some validation from people around me and most importantly, validation from myself. My parents had a huge fall out during my high school and my father decided to kick us out,  remarry and send me to student hostel for preparing for college. I was low-key happy and thought this would be my way out from my childhood misery. I was so wrong. 

I hardly had any contact with my parents and my brother. I was stalked and harassed by a group of boys. Things escalated so quickly that this group kidnapped me, molested me, physically wounded me and left me to die on streets. It took me 7-8 months to physically recuperate but it messed up my academic progress, my mental health was shattered and I was in so much trauma I started having hallucinations, violent outbursts and black outs. My parents realized how much damaged I was and came to my aid. They stayed with me for next 1.5 years, tended to me, helped me recover and prepare for my college admissions. I ended up getting admitted in a good college with a major of my choice.

In college, I had a hard time scoring good in new, advanced subjects. I know grades aren't anything, but for me this is the one thing I thought I had, good grades for self-validation, and I saw that slowly slipping away from me. I got into a relationship and my ex didn't take even a year to cheat on me. I started having severe migraine attacks and soon seizures. My behavior changed, I had a fall-out with whatever friends I had made. Everyone stopped looking out for me, except my parents. But they were living in a different town, separated. I would bunk classes for days, stay in my bed for days without eating or any social contact. I was considered a relatively attractive girl in my college and that unfortunately invited a lot of rumors and false gossips on me. These small factors made things worse for me until I decided to call ot quits and run away. Thankfully my parents intervened, found me and sent me to all sorts of doctors. Medical intervention and professional counseling did help me significantly in getting better, both physically and mentally. It gave me strength for at least next 2-3 years to pull myself together and improve my life. I did. I managed to graduate with an above average grade, get a PhD offer in a decent research institution and started dating my current fiancé. Things seemed positive and fine for me.

Cutting back to present, PhD life is not easy. Its a grueling phase of life every grad student has to go through. I am experiencing my share of failures and hopelessness in my research years. I developed PCOS that makes me suffer through intense abdominal pains at least for 3-5 days every month. I have my share of anxiety, mood swings and insomnia. Here is the deal. I feel like even smallest inconveniences in my life breaks me up. I still have nightmares from my past. I had a huge decline in my sex drive partly because I still have nightmares of what happened to me 9 years ago. No matter how much I try, I can't get over my past sufferings, always afraid that this is not the end of my sufferings and something really bad is going to happen to me that is going to shatter me. I feel so hopeless, guilty, disappointed in myself for losing my grip, scared of future and failures, scared of losing my relationship and at the same time feel guilty that I am doing injustice to the beautiful person my fiance is.

I don't feel like talking to my fiance because I know he had a decent past and he respects me for how I have overcome mine. I am afraid to open up to him, admit to him that I can't get over my past till date and that I think its highly unfair of me to expect him to share my grief and depression. I don't feel like getting professional help here in my grad school because there is just too many formalities. Its not like I get a walk in appointment and talk my heart out. I have lost my regular contact with my friends. When I try to talk to my mother, she insists I submit myself to religion and faith in God. I tried but it didn't work. I don't have faith in any gods. I am angry and frustrated that I still don't have a normal, pain free, anxiety and stress free life after going through so much.

Within 2 months of lockdown (my research suffered a great deal because of this) I could feel that feeling of emptiness, hopelessness, low self esteem, low mental and physical capacity, desire to do nothing, everything I suffered while clinically depressed few years ago, creeping back into me. I am obliged I am not interested in killing myself, but I am just becoming nihilistic. I have started abusing alcohol and Marijuana intake and hardly make any appearance in my social circle. My fiance is suffering because of all this. I know I have to pull myself back again for his sake. I don't know how.

I don&amp;#39;t have faith in any gods. I am angry and frustrated that I still don&amp;#39;t have a normal, pain free, anxiety and stress free life after going through so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 2 months of lockdown (my research suffered a great deal because of this) I could feel that feeling of emptiness, hopelessness, low self esteem, low mental and physical capacity, desire to do nothing, everything I suffered while clinically depressed few years ago, creeping back into me. I am obliged I am not interested in killing myself, but I am just becoming nihilistic. I have started abusing alcohol and Marijuana intake and hardly make any appearance in my social circle. My fiance is suffering because of all this. I know I have to pull myself back again for his sake. I don&amp;#39;t know how. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am afraid I have to live with occasional bouts of hopelessness and pain all throughout my life and my past sufferings have done a permanent damage to me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"the past week ive grinding, being ‘responsible’ (cooking, eating, taking care of my cat + dog, running everyday, cleaning, doing homework) despite how miserable and physically/emotionally isolated i feel. yesterday though, i kinda just said fuck it and had 1 meal + slept most the day. broke my running streak and forgot to walk my dog (i let her out though, dw). 

my point is, do you ever have objectively good days yet still feel like a failure? like, objectively i am making good progress and you’de expect your head to be in correlation to that. my simp day didnt make it feel any more or less worst. unfortunately even in those really good days where things in hindsight are going well, im constantly at battle with myself and hating myself. what progress is being made if i cant turn my self-hatred around?

Long story short: 
I am a deck officer in merchant Navy, joined this field due to financial hardships at home. Now, since 2015 my career growth has been tremendous slow to the point that I have cut down all communicatins with my pals as all of them are doing well .
I signed off from my ship in July-19 , I had gave readiness to my present company in Sep-19 but then they said me that I need to do some inhouse courses to join and this time they will give me promotion for 2nd officer which was long overdue.

Only thing was that course was scheduled in Jan-20, due to promotion thing I agreed ,and then after Jan-20 when I asked when I will be joining back to ship ,they said that it would be in Feb,but it would be at same rank and not promotional rank. Promotion will be subject to onboard appraisal and even then there is no guarantee this was said by a superintendent who is a captain btw, one of the most negative persons you will ever met.

Since Sep-19 I was trying for other companies , and luckily (or unluckily) My promotional thing was accepted by one of the largest ship management companies after clearing their interviews and all.

Then in Feb-19 , I did their in house courses ,gave my documents etc. ,they have already lined up for a ship where joining would be in April. 

And thanks to Covid-19 , everything got fucked up. 

But then in end-may, Government of India  started giving permissions for charted flights specially for seafarers. Most of my friends have gone back to their jobs., while I am still stuck and the new company is not even giving me any hope.

Since I had already given my documents and all to this new company, my present company won't entertain me as I haven't been keeping touch with them .

Now , I am in a very critical situation .
I am not able to pay the debts of a consumer loan which I had taken in nov-19 which is affecting my credit score and also huge interest of 36 percentage and also the bounce charges which is being levied by the bank .
 All mutual funds are in negative and I have stopped all the SIPs, Home loan is being taken care of due to moratrium but when the honeymoon period ends, I would be in deep shit. 
Many here might say ,that I should not have buy a house or taken a loan, let me tell you that that whole life I have lived in a 150 sq.ft room, and I atleast deserved to live a better life after slogging so much and then also I played quite safe and my EMI is still 20 percentage of my yearly earnings.

,depression,"So I have bad memory problems from what happened to me as a child, I blocked out a lot of the really bad things that happened as a self defence mechanism. I've had depression since I was 14 but it's only been diagnosed since 19 (when I finally moved out). I had no idea why I was feeling this way and was ashamed because I felt ungrateful for feeling that way. Recently I started remembering things that happen to me as a child. I'm the oldest of 3 girls and so I always felt it was my duty to protect my little sisters from as much abuse as possible. I suddenly remembered stuff like when my mom threw a hamper at me when I was 4-5 because she was running late for work, or when my dad and ex-stepmom we're having a fight because she thought it was unfair that her 3 year old daughters were getting less food than me 13 and my sisters 10 and 8. 
If this is the stuff that I'm only now remembering then what else happened that I don't remember?

I&amp;#39;ve had depression since I was 14 but it&amp;#39;s only been diagnosed since 19 (when I finally moved out). I had no idea why I was feeling this way and was ashamed because I felt ungrateful for feeling that way. Recently I started remembering things that happen to me as a child. I&amp;#39;m the oldest of 3 girls and so I always felt it was my duty to protect my little sisters from as much abuse as possible. I suddenly remembered stuff like when my mom threw a hamper at me when I was 4-5 because she was running late for work, or when my dad and ex-stepmom we&amp;#39;re having a fight because she thought it was unfair that her 3 year old daughters were getting less food than me 13 and my sisters 10 and 8. 
If this is the stuff that I&amp;#39;m only now remembering then what else happened that I don&amp;#39;t remember? I don&amp;#39;t know who else to talk to about this, I don&amp;#39;t trust my parents to tell me the truth and I don&amp;#39;t have any close friends.

,depression,"I don’t want to die, but a comfortable life feels like an impossible dream. I’m an 18 year old female (not sure if my gender is relevant but whatever) and I feel like my life is going to be an absolute train wreck. I don’t feel capable of achieving anything and I’m afraid to live alone. I don’t think I will ever find the right man and my standards for everything are so high. I just want life to be simple and enjoyable but I feel like it’ll be unbearable, filled with things I can’t handle because I’m completely useless. 

I don’t feel a deep connection with most people, I feel so lonely, like I’m living behind a wall of glass and so is everyone else. I fear that my talents will never be recognised, and I will never be understood, seen and valued for who I really am. I don’t know if I will ever earn enough money to leave home and the people in my area and city aren’t exactly friendly.

To add to that, I dropped out of school earlier this year because I felt so incapable of doing well and panicked because some of my teachers hated me and I had no close, real friends. I learned about narcissism and realised narcissists were literally everywhere, I became paranoid. It was like the world turned black and I had no one to talk to who understood my point of view or knew the things I knew. I couldn’t handle it, it was like a crisis. I felt so alone and afraid. Now I’m even more worthless, no one will probably ever hire me except supermarkets if I’m lucky. No man will likely ever love me because he will be too embarrassed, because I carry a symbol of low intellect and status. I feel less than human because of it. I wish I knew before that some people evaluate the entirety of a human being on their status and accomplishments. I know those aren’t the best people, but I assume they are most people. I fear that no one will have the capacity to see beyond it, and my identity will be associated with the stereotype of “dropout” for the rest of my life. It’s terrible and unchangeable. The shame and stigma makes me want to isolate myself forever.

It’s so rare to find people who want an intimate connection, and even if I do find them they probably won’t want to be near me because I left school early. I’m aware that my perception is probably inaccurate. I had such big dreams but they’ve been crushed. Before I learned about the darker sides to humanity I was intensely optimistic. I was really confident and people would idealise me and I loved everyone so much. I felt so vibrant, but it’s a state I may never be in again. I was planning to earn a living as a musician or a writer but I just don’t think it’s possible for me anymore. I also don’t like people very much, most of them are unconscious, self centred, deceptive and untrustworthy. I feel so hopeless. I’m honestly just annoyed at humans and the way society is structured. I’m also annoyed at myself for being so pathetic and sensitive. 

All in all, I refuse to fully accept that my future is a train wreck, my life has been good up until this point. If I had to accept that I would have no reason to live. I’m completely clueless when it comes to the corporeal aspects of life and physical responsibilities. I’m too afraid to lead my life, I’m literally incapable. I wish we lived in tribes or extended family households. I wish life as a human wasn’t such an intimidating, boring responsibility.

After a lot of intense therapy I can walk again but I limp and have no fine motor control. I was born with a hypermobility disorder, so I have a natural lack of stability in my joints and dislocate easily. The combination of this and the lack of motor control causes me severe joint pain on my weak side. I have had depression since childhood. I've developed really reliable and usually healthy coping skills and I normally have an incredible and large support system. I started taking wellbutrin this spring and it was helping a lot more than I thought it would. 

I worked 10- 15 hours a week until COVID and it takes everything out of me. I applied for disability almost a year ago. It's a long process and is incredibly hard to get disability under the age of 45 in the US because you have to be able to prove that you can't 1) work enough to support yourself right now or
2) realistically learn to work enough to support yourself through school/work training.
The state I live in doesn't have a temporary disability program. And they do not help younger disabled people pay for the type of education that they would need to support themselves. I lost my job during COVID so I applied for unemployment 68 days ago. The status of my claim has been ""processed"" since the first week. I'm apparently one of the 30% of people in my state who have applied that are still waiting for their benefits. It's a big problem in my state and people are finding it literally impossible to get in contact with anyone for information. I've tried everything. for months. I don't even know if I'll be approved because I work so little and am applying for disability.

  I lately have had the hardest time getting out of bed. I feel like I'm rotting into the floor.  I've been forgetting to take my meds. I have no job. I have no money for gas to go anywhere with. Going for a long walk would be great if it wouldn't end up putting me in more pain later in the day. My insurance won't pay for an electric wheelchair. I struggle to propel a regular wheelchair because of the paralysis/weakness in my arm. I can do it, but its actually more difficult than walking. I feel trapped in my house. For context,  My IQ has always tested between 139 and 141, so very high.  Being this mentally unstimulated is hell for me.

My house is a mess. Not filthy but overwhelming and unorganized. I feel like I want to throw up or die constantly. The people I normally rely on for support have distanced themselves, not deliberately or with malicious intent, but because I have a hard time joining them in their activities, so we see less of eachother, or because they had a baby, or because they moved or got married and a new job. I'm not angry and they are all kind to me, but I can't help but feel very very left behind by life. I am in so much pain  constantly. Sometimes it's so bad that my own brain can't process that amount of pain and my ears ring and I go blank for a second. I used to just want to die or stop existing all the time. I still do. But now I really badly just want to dance again. I used to be a GREAT dancer. Wanting to die is BS but I'm used to it and I eventually will get to die. I will probably never dance in a way that's satisfying to me again.  I haven't even gotten started on how current events are affecting my mental health, but I just realized how long this is and its been somehow both cathartic and embarrassing.

&lt;p&gt;My house is a mess. Not filthy but overwhelming and unorganized. I feel like I want to throw up or die constantly. The people I normally rely on for support have distanced themselves, not deliberately or with malicious intent, but because I have a hard time joining them in their activities, so we see less of eachother, or because they had a baby, or because they moved or got married and a new job. I&amp;#39;m not angry and they are all kind to me, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel very very left behind by life. I am in so much pain  constantly. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s so bad that my own brain can&amp;#39;t process that amount of pain and my ears ring and I go blank for a second. I used to just want to die or stop existing all the time. I still do. But now I really badly just want to dance again. I used to be a GREAT dancer. Wanting to die is BS but I&amp;#39;m used to it and I eventually will get to die. I will probably never dance in a way that&amp;#39;s satisfying to me again.  I haven&amp;#39;t even gotten started on how current events are affecting my mental health, but I just realized how long this is and its been somehow both cathartic and embarrassing. I had a point but I can&amp;#39;t even remember what I was planning to ask of discuss. I guess I&amp;#39;m just hoping someone might have something to say that helps&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"We were at the same school, him and me. The year is not important. His ex girlfriend was with one of my best friend and causing drama. Being a drama person, I talked to him to know his version of the story, which was more having sense than the girl’s story.

I’m also a depressive person who’s hiding. Lots of people don’t know and wouldn’t even think about me being depressive. But he did knew it. We talked some times about our problems. I tried helped him and he helped me. Why have I said tried? Because he didn’t trusted me. All along. I was trusting him, really. I kinda thought it was us against the world. I told him to never leave me and he said he wouldn’t do that.

We talked one time, face to face. I told him I don’t wanted to eat anymore and felt like it was sort of useless. He wasn’t of this advice so he came hanging out with me and two friends, which he was friends with one of them. We talked, only the both of us, all the way to the restaurant we wanted to. There was too much people so we just grabbed something at the gas station and went back walking to school. It was Halloween actually, I just remembered.

We texted for weeks, I was in love with him. I loved the way he was, the way he thought! I founded him so perfect. I guess that didn’t last. We were texting good night with hearts and fighting over who is the cutest between us. We were almost a couple. But as I said earlier, he didn’t trusted me. He was getting more and more distant, letting me in read and saying that no one in the world could never be there for him, even me.

My dog died the 15th October and that’s when I slowly started to go out of my normal state. I mean, lying and faking a smile is easy with my friends, but when I’m alone.. I can’t fake to myself. And after he left me not saying why, my state became more horrible and I really started to be in depression. I kept asking myself if I was worth it or not, was I good enough? I guess not.

Then my dad started. He kept reminding me how useless I was because I couldn’t do the work properly. He wanted me to do exactly like him, this way. I tried and tried not doing anything, hoping he’ll change, but he’s like that since I’m 7 (my parents broke up). He has anger issues but never managed to find a way to control it, he always just thought of him, but he’s saying he’s doing this for us. He keeps pushing everyone down and he supposed to keep us up for not falling. That made me way more depressed than anything. (I’m actually finding a way or we’ll go to the justice so my mother will have me full time because of more and more problems he caused)

It’s been a year since I’m in depression. Since 2019. It’s maybe stupid, I’m only 14. I try to tell everything to someone, but this person leave. People at school say we can talk to them, but they don’t understand that we can’t. They are not like us, they don’t see the way we see and I’m sure that’s what hurts the most... Feeling so different that nobody will understand and feel the way we do. The time we passed crying all night. All the time we had to hide to cry alone. All the things we tried, just to get out of this... but never succeed.

I imagine, I dreamed of my “death”. I know what I think about, I can’t think about something else when I’m in a mental breakdown. And when I’m doing a panic attack about myself and all is happening, the world stops to me. Like everything was going slowly and I was in the present. It’s weird to explain, but still.

I tried and tried not doing anything, hoping he’ll change, but he’s like that since I’m 7 (my parents broke up). He has anger issues but never managed to find a way to control it, he always just thought of him, but he’s saying he’s doing this for us. He keeps pushing everyone down and he supposed to keep us up for not falling. That made me way more depressed than anything. (I’m actually finding a way or we’ll go to the justice so my mother will have me full time because of more and more problems he caused)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since I’m in depression. Since 2019. It’s maybe stupid, I’m only 14. I try to tell everything to someone, but this person leave. People at school say we can talk to them, but they don’t understand that we can’t. They are not like us, they don’t see the way we see and I’m sure that’s what hurts the most... Feeling so different that nobody will understand and feel the way we do. The time we passed crying all night. All the time we had to hide to cry alone. All the things we tried, just to get out of this... but never succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine, I dreamed of my “death”. I know what I think about, I can’t think about something else when I’m in a mental breakdown. And when I’m doing a panic attack about myself and all is happening, the world stops to me. Like everything was going slowly and I was in the present. It’s weird to explain, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they left me here, alone, in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Im Curious if anybody else had ha a terrible time MENTALLY with comming off venlafaxine. 
I was taking 300 mg for the past two and a half years. And this year I decided that was it. I was tired of the side affects and I started to take wellbutrin which was working better for me. 

A bit of back story I wouldn't say I have a drug dependency issue... I've done loads of non pharmaceutical drugs, and although I would say for small periods of time I was addicted to coke I never let myself spiral past a year of using it. I experienced cravings but I was able to distract myself with weed. But never. I really mean never have I ever gone through withdrawal this bad.

I weaned off by reducing my dose until I was taking 37.5mg
I would open the caps and weigh out half that amount and make myself 18.75mg caps. I weaned off so slowly probably over the span of six months. Bu the last month I was taking 18.5 every two days and then  every four days and then I stopped. 

It's been 2.5 weeks since I've had my last dose. I have the pills in my medicine cabinet and I literally can not bring myself to dispose of them (hand them back to the pharmacy). I feel like I did when I would have coke in my house. It was too valuable of a high to destroy it. And even though I haven't taken any I feel like i want to crush up the balls and snort them and I fantasize about this atleast two or three times a day. 

This here is huge proof that the work ive been doing on my mental health has been lacking. Because I want to remove this crutch and stand on my own without the venlafaxine and I literally dont think I can. You know why? Cause life was more FUN when I was using it. Where as my life now.on wellbutrin is more stable and positive and sustainable. It's no HIGH. Not like effexor was. And part of me feels like I want to just take it cause the withdrawal symptoms are so rough. 

Any people here used venlafaxine and had a hard time comming off? 

I'd like to also say that I've tried to stop taking it at least 4 times and I was successful this time. It's the first.time since I started that I dont use it at all. 
And lastly any pharmaceutical drugs I've taken have been prescribed. These are juet about 30 or 40 left over pills i have that I cant part with.

,depression,"Hi everyone, 

I’ve been thinking about this recently and wondered whether anyone else has had the same experience. 

I experienced a period of depression about 4 years ago that had built up over the few years prior to that. The worst portion of it lasted for around 3 months, culminating in a few incidents of non-suicidal self harm. My parents noticed the cuts and spoke to me about it; at the time we talked about it a few times in highly emotional discussions but since then it has never been brought up or referenced. I don’t hold this against them as I know they didn’t know how to respond or help, and I didn’t know what kind of support I wanted either. But the fact that it’s never mentioned has meant that this time in my life is kind of a black mark in my memory that no one knows about or understands. Sort of like the ‘elephant in the room’ of the memory storage zone of my brain. Moreover, while my parents know about my self-harm, they don’t understand what the solo recovery process I’ve had to get on with has been like. I don’t really feel I can talk to them about something like this, we’re just not that kind of family.

I ultimately managed to recover from my period of depression. I am now happy to say that I am an extremely happy, confident and easygoing person. I’m now seen as the ‘chilled, funny friend‘ that rarely panics about anything (as well as being everyone’s unpaid shrink).

However, no one knows about the dark times I went through before this, or the fact that the reason I am this type of person now is because I know what unhappiness is like and therefore always try to support people and bring joy into people’s lives. My friends did not notice my depression at the time (or if they did they didn’t bring it up, and neither did I) and it doesn’t feel right to tell them after all this time, because although I don’t hold it against them that they weren’t aware of it (I did a fab job of covering it up), I know they’d feel awful if they found out that I was once going through something like that and A) they didn’t know and B) I didn’t feel I could tell them for whatever reason. 

Almost all of the time, I am genuinely happy. However I’ve noticed that when I’m alone or at night, I think a lot about those dark times that shaped me so much. For a long time, I wasn’t bothered by thinking about it so much as I knew it was something I needed to process and I knew blocking it out could lead to problems further down the line. But as 4 years have now passed, I’m getting to the point where I really just want to move on now and stop thinking about it so much. 

I understand it was a formative experience in my life and I’m not trying to forget the past, but I also don’t want to keep dwelling on it forever. Online articles and blogs tell me I need to ‘find closure’, but I’m not really sure how to ‘find closure’ or what that really means for me. I’ve made an effort to find closure, by slowly reintroducing myself to some of the things I cut out of my life when I began my healing process, such as fiction novels, social media, and certain genres of music. During my difficult times, these were things I used as escapism rather than dealing with my problems, and so I now have negative associations with them and used to worry that if I was exposed to these things again, it would trigger old wounds to reopen. Sometimes reintroducing myself to them is hard, but overall the fact that the ceiling doesn’t suddenly cave in when I expose myself to them is encouraging and makes me realise I’m more emotionally resilient than I might think. 

However, I don’t feel that doing all these things has really contributed as much as I want to taking me further to ‘moving on’. 

What I’d like your opinions on is: Am I being unrealistic in thinking I should be able to move on after ‘only’ 4 years, or is it bad news that I’m still thinking about it quite a lot? What else can I do to help myself move on and find closure from my past depression and self harm? Or are they memories which will forever kind of haunt me, and that’s something I’ll have to learn to accept?

,depression,"Hey guys, thanks for reading this and your time

I've been dealing with a hideous descent into depression. I get these from time to time, but usually, they get triggered by events in my life. I've been suffering from depression waves since my teenage years, but they have become more apparent around my 19th year. I'm 23 now and they have become awful. I noticed that slowly, things wouldn't be fun for me anymore. Drawing, going out, playing video games, talking to people I like. These things would often give me a reaction in my brain and my brain would make dopamines whenever I did them. Slowly, they just stopped doing this to me (over the course of years). Now I either feel absolutely nothing or just plain miserable whatever I'm doing. They become the worst when I'm doing nothing or not talking to anyone, I need to constantly interact with someone to keep my brain busy, and even then I have the occasional slip-ups of negative thoughts in my brain that would snowball into me having graphic clips playing in my head where I'm either self-harming or killing myself.

The problem I am dealing with now is that I feel absolutely no enjoyment from eating. I have not eaten anything in almost 3 days or a little more. I have not gotten out of bed to cook anything (despite doing groceries) it's just not fun to me anymore. It feels like a chore when I have to put food in my mouth and eat it. I don't feel good when I eat anymore, and because of this I just haven't done anything regarding food. I used to enjoy going for big bowls of Ramen, sushi, takoyaki, and all that stuff but now I just don't care anymore and I don't want to eat anything at all. I tried to eat yesterday, I finally made a grilled cheese at around 11 pm after which I drank water and my body just literally rejected it and I ended up throwing it all up.

Right now all I eat in a day is 1 cup of coffee with oat milk, some crackers, and that's all. I usually love cooking and doing things in the kitchen, and I used to get very excited about food. But now I just feel nothing towards it.

This is terrifying to me. I'm not having fun anymore, and now it has extended to eating. My body is starving itself and I feel like I can't force my brain to eat. If I do force myself, it just feels miserable to me and I throw away my food after a few bites. I don't know what to do. My therapist says I'm depressed and yes, I believe that, but I have heard stories before of people starving to death due to depression and I'm terrified this is going to happen to me. I really value my body a lot too and I don't want to get very thin. I've now lost 5 KG in a week and even my mother notices I lost too much weight too quickly. I don't know what to do or how to get myself to eat anymore.

There is a constant hole in my stomach and it sometimes hurts, but I can't get myself to eat or feel like I /want/ to eat.

I know people will say ""just eat bro"" but it's not that easy. It's not enjoyable. Even if I force myself, it just tastes weird and gross in my mouth and I actually feel full after a few bites. What should I be doing? What's going on with me and why is my brain doing this to me? I just want to eat again.

,depression,"it's been a long time coming if I'm being honest. 21 years old and recently homeless. no real friends, denounced my parents, addicted to a few things. i haven't felt a genuine, loving touch of another human being in about 3 years now. i haven't been able to talk to anyone about what's going on in my head because it's either too much, they won't listen/don't care, or i just don't know how to explain it.


i miss my dog, I love you so much baby. i know you'll be okay, I just hate how the last time i saw you that you were so confused. where have i been? where am i going? i know you were so happy to see me and i know you'll be okay. I'd give up everything i have left, just God if there even is one, please let her live a happy life. 


I'm sorry K, i know you've been letting me stay with you recently and i couldn't be more grateful to you and wish i could do so much more to help out around the house and the dogs. i know you say I'm not a burden whenever i say i am and tell me I'm not in the way whenever me and my belongings are. you're such a beautiful person. i know you have so much going on in your life and it's tough to have me come along with my issues, but you've been pushing and grinding through the days better and stronger than i ever could. I've grown quite fond of you since i met you. i hope you reach a level plane one day and meet your goals and desires head on like i know you will.


I'm sorry H, i know we just talked last night. i always loved you more than you will ever know. i know the circumstances weren't the best, but you were still a good friend to the end. don't blame yourself for anything. it's just how it is. don't forget what i said about the notebook. you know what to do with it.

I'm sorry K, G, T, C, and B. i know we never talk anymore, but we'll always be the Dead Breakfast Club till the end.

I'm sorry C. fuck man, it's been so long. i miss you so much, i hope you're doing well. i know it was rough to do what you have, but you really grew up. i hope you know i think about you a lot.

I'm sorry if you don't see what may signify you. either you never really gave a fuck, or typing through these tears and this headache made me forget.

if you know me, you should know how i truly felt about you. if you don't know how i felt about you, than take a step back and think about why that is.


I'm sorry mom, dad, grandma. I'm sorry i wasn't enough, no matter how hard i always tried. whether sports, academics, or just personality: it was never to your liking. it was never enough. i was never enough, no matter what you think, i can tell that's how you've always felt. there's so much that happened while growing up that I'm sorry for, but the worst of them all is this moment. in this moment, this is the one thing I'll never be able to truly apologize for. 


i regret not taking another handful of pills last time i tried. i regret the night the gun jammed and i sat screaming, wishing I could just get out. i regret not being ejected from the seat when that car pulled out in front of me. all these moments spent cheating death, but I've always known it'd be by my hands. the times when i was told i should've been dead, or that it's okay because it was meant to be. ""it wasn't your time."" and ""you have so much to live for"". it was never any of these things, it was because i fucked up again and again. such a simple task I've always failed at. just another one added to the list i guess.
 


the headaches getting worse, the tears won't stop, I'm slowly losing consciousness, and any lingering pains are beginning to slip into numbness. so, one last thing.

,depression,"I've dealt with depression for over 20 years by now but it feels like it's getting worse and worse. I'm not just depressed anymore, I'm actively scared. Scared of everything, nothing, what could happen, what might happen. I've seen dozens of therapists over the years and not a single one has really helped. I've been on meds and it didn't help. The people I could actually talk to don't understand it at all. They don't get how much energy it takes to function on a basic level. They don't get that it quickly gets overwhelming on a daily basis.

The only think keeping me from being suicidal is my kids, it's not fair to screw them up like I am. But at the same time after my divorce my role in their lives is so small its just another source of depression. I hardly smile anymore, much less laugh. The brave face I put on daily is wearing thin. I have no support in this. Basically, my family just wants me to see a shrink and get back on meds.

There's just so much crap in every direction I look, I don't see a reason to even try to get better. It's pointless.

I haven't even mentioned the anger. If I'm not scared, I'm angry. Really angry. Angry at everything and nothing. For the most part I control it. But almost daily something happens to really set me off. I don't let it out. Ever. I can't. If I did it would make any situation worse and that would make my depression worse. So I keep the vast majority of it in and that makes my depression worse too.

Reading this post it doesn't do it justice. It feels like it's past words. Past communicating how hard it is for me.

,depression,"folks on this sub (and other similar subs, where I'll be crossposting) have been really kind and helpful, which I appreciate so much. I wanted to share my experience just in case it's useful to someone else.

without getting into too much detail, I was planning to kill myself on Monday morning. but instead, I went to my local crisis center, which is free and available to anyone in the community having a mental health crisis or drug/alcohol problems.

I didn't know what to expect when I got there and was pretty nervous. but it wasn't scary at all. just kind of strange, because I'd never been somewhere like that before.

when I arrived, a security guard did a COVID-19 screening (asked if I had symptoms or had been in contact with anyone who had it, etc). then he had me empty my pockets and did a scan like they do at the airport, to make sure I didn't have any weapons or anything. he looked in my purse and said he'd need to keep it (I had headphones and chargers in there and no wires are allowed in the building, etc), but I was allowed to keep my phone.

I filled out some simple paperwork. then I saw a nurse, who took my blood pressure and asked about my medical history, as well as what had brought me in today. I explained to him that I was suicidal, gave him a basic rundown of what's happening in my life and told him what my suicide plan was when he asked.

then I waited a little while longer and finally saw a counselor.

we talked for about an hour. he was really kind and I didn't feel embarrassed or ashamed while talking to him, which surprised me. he told me he doesn't think I have depression, which was confusing tbh. but I'm not a counselor, so what do I know?

initially, he suggested that I go to the hospital for a few days, but I was hesitant, because I can't take a lot of time off work and I was concerned about how much that would cost. I said I would need more info about that process before deciding, but we didn't discuss it beyond that.

ultimately there's only so much that he could do for me in an hour. he helped me write up a basic plan for when I'm feeling suicidal (who I could call, that kind of thing) and wrote down a website where I could search for a therapist (which I'd already gotten from the person I talked to through Lifeline Chat, so it wasn't new info to me). that was it.

he arranged a time to call me the next day and check in (to make sure I hadn't killed myself, I guess), but said that if I didn't pick up the phone, he wouldn't be concerned.

that was... weirdly disappointing, in a way I wouldn't have expected. it felt almost like, because I'm ""well"" enough to hold down a job and take care of my responsibilities, he didn't see my situation as particularly urgent and he figured I'd be fine, even though he'd said I should consider hospitalization an hour before and I'd confirmed to him that I still wanted to die.

like, I could be wrong. I'm not an expert, obviously, and I'm not a mind reader. that's just how it felt to me.

after that, I went home.

he called on Tuesday, at the time he said he would, and confirmed that he'd call again at the same time on Wednesday for one last check-in. but nobody ever called. which was honestly upsetting to me, because I'd had two really hard nights and was having suicidal thoughts again, so I was kind of counting on that call. I know I shouldn't complain about a free service. it was just disappointing.

I'm still suicidal and feeling low and overwhelmed. it's been a hard week. going to the crisis center didn't change much for me, not that I expected it to. going there did keep me from killing myself this week, though, so I'd recommend it for that alone, even though I still don't really want to be here.

so if you've ever wondered what happens when you go to the crisis center... that's what it was like for me, and I imagine it's probably similar at most places. your mileage may vary.

honestly, my biggest regret is not agreeing to go the hospital when the counselor initially brought it up. I think I should've gone. maybe they could've helped me there. I'll never know for su re.

I remember sitting in the crisis center, thinking ""if I don't go to the hospital and get treatment now, I never will,"" and I still feel that way. I don't think I'll seek further treatment. I know myself well enough to know that. I missed my window, like I always do.

,depression," I have been unhappy for years. I am 21 years old and I finished my only year of study in an environment that I don't even like. I have feelings that I do not understand, for example I know that I feel joy at times but it is empty inside. The few friends I have are only there when something goes wrong in their lives and they need advice or there is an interesting drama in my life and they can have the right one role. I was in the hospital but once there I was unable to express my discomfort so I just stayed for my suicidal urge.

 I no longer have the courage to commit suicide, and therefore I am only suffering but it is unbearable. I'm just changing behaviors to suit everyone, because I know they don't like the real me but the me they want. I did everything to be loved, I even made up lies that nobody discovered all that to be loved, or I influenced relationships to be able to be in the center, and I know it was bad but I just wanted to be loved and to be helped. Today I dreamed of my first true love of 3 years ago and once again I wake up with this loneliness, which prevents me from acting because I tell myself what good is it ?

 I have always lived for others, and I know that I am unable to live for others because what I want is to be loved.

,depression,"Just incase, don't worry, im not suicidal, not yet anyways.

My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and I need to do like 22 packets if I wanna graduate.",t2_vmwwp1m,False,,0,False,My life has been a mess for years and I don't know what to do anymore.,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hbvu4y,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592578027.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just incase, don&amp;#39;t worry, im not suicidal, not yet anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The thoughts are back again and I don't know what to do.

I get urges to act on them and I just sit there in the corner of my room crying my eyes out because I honestly don't know what to do with myself, I wanna act on them but I just feel it would hurt my mum too much, she was talking to me about how she was sad and cried a lot when my brother left for uni and she told me she wouldn't know what she'd do if I wasn't here with her.

I sleep a lot to avoid the thoughts and everything when I can, but I know I can't do that as often because I have schoolwork to catch up on and that's just adding on to the stress, seeing how much work is overdue just frustrates me because I know I'm failing myself.

My sleeping patterns vary from time to time, sometimes I can't sleep at all and I'll stay awake days on end and then other times I just sleep so much for days.

When I'm asleep everything is gone, I don't need to worry about anything and everything just becomes so peaceful.

I just feel, what's the point in doing anything if I'm probably gonna end up dead in a couple years?

I feel like no one really gives a shit anymore and when I think about it, I don't have as many friends as I think I do. Of course you make friends and may fall out with them, cause that's just what happens but everyone around me has that one friend that they hang out with everyday, talk to everyday and can rely on.I have no best friend and I am no one's best friend.

I don't really have any future plans, I don't know why I do the things I do.I have a few things I kind of enjoy, like piano and guitar, but they're becoming so exhausting to me now and I keep thinking, what's the point in doing any of that when there are people out there who are so much better than me at those things plus anyone could learn to do those things, doing it doesn't make me talented or special.

I just feel so useless and worthless to everyone, I feel no one really wants me around and they just put up with me cause they're afraid of telling me the truth, and I don't blame them tbh, I don't really like myself either. I'm literally everything I hate.

But as it always does, the depression came back, I started getting lazy, started getting boring. She started to feel like I wasn't putting in the effort anymore.

I seriously tried, I tried so fucking hard believe me. But other than small little gestures, I couldn't muster up the energy most days to get out of bed, let alone show her how much I appreciated her.

And she got tired of it, she got tired of me always apologizing, always having to backtrack my words, always feeling like she's the only one putting any effort into the relationship.

She literally became my best friend, for the first time in years I felt like I had someone who understood me, someone I knew I needed in my life, someone who I felt I could look up to and finally pull myself out of this.

We're still friends, but I can't do it anymore. It hurts. It hurts knowing I fucked up again, it hurts knowing I gave up the only good thing I had in my life. It hurts looking at her and knowing I let her see me at my worst, that I let her down, that I lost her.

I'm fucking tired of it all. I try so hard, I give it my all everytime, but there's always something missing. There's always a cloud hanging above my head that stops me from really showing people how much I care about them.

I'm so tired of trying over and over again and letting everyone down. 

I just want it to end. I have a little bit of money saved up, I'm going to move out soon. My parents think I'm going into my second year of university, but they don't know that I got kicked out.

I'm going to live it up for however long my cash lasts, I'm going to ride a high, and when it's done, when I have nothing else left, by the end of this year. I'm going to end it.

I wrote letters to everyone in my family, to my roommates, to her, I want them to know that none of what happens is their fault. This is just me giving up, again, this is just me not being able to live like this until death takes me.

And although its an amazing thing to happen it has been the hardest thing ive ever done ,its a super long way from the safety of my home, and the few people i have in my life that have got me through my life to this point , obviously with moving comes other responsibilities like working starting from scratch , i had a pretty decent job back home in car panel shop a job which i was given by family so i adjusted easier than normal as those situations of socialising and meeting new people and having conversations at work are personally hard and can be exhausting with anxiety when you cant really relax throughout your day.now im essentially back to square one having to even find a job is new let alone fit in anywhere , i know i have to make it work but i panic on the phone interview worrying i sound stupid and it puts me off chasing jobs or video interviews where i have to self record and i just crumble in front of the camera stuttering and loosing focus, i also picture the myself in the job itself im applying for and cant see how ill fit in and that always knocks me back , ive always been a hard worker but im afraid i dont come off well on first impressions due to the anxiety of presenting myself how i feel i should be seen , although we have a good roof over us and have some money saved its a lot of stress and worry right now and its always hard to explain to people why you find it so hard when they have never experienced panic attacks or been depressed and anxious when even normal daily tasks take so much energy even just to get out of bed and go outside the house.

And although its an amazing thing to happen it has been the hardest thing ive ever done ,its a super long way from the safety of my home, and the few people i have in my life that have got me through my life to this point , obviously with moving comes other responsibilities like working starting from scratch , i had a pretty decent job back home in car panel shop a job which i was given by family so i adjusted easier than normal as those situations of socialising and meeting new people and having conversations at work are personally hard and can be exhausting with anxiety when you cant really relax throughout your day.now im essentially back to square one having to even find a job is new let alone fit in anywhere , i know i have to make it work but i panic on the phone interview worrying i sound stupid and it puts me off chasing jobs or video interviews where i have to self record and i just crumble in front of the camera stuttering and loosing focus, i also picture the myself in the job itself im applying for and cant see how ill fit in and that always knocks me back , ive always been a hard worker but im afraid i dont come off well on first impressions due to the anxiety of presenting myself how i feel i should be seen , although we have a good roof over us and have some money saved its a lot of stress and worry right now and its always hard to explain to people why you find it so hard when they have never experienced panic attacks or been depressed and anxious when even normal daily tasks take so much energy even just to get out of bed and go outside the house. Heres just to hoping that i can be strong enough to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Let me just start of by saying that life sucks. 


So I've been best friends with this dude christian for about 2 and a half years now and we were as tight as 2 straight guys could be. We've told eachother everything over the years and hes like a legit brother to me. He kept me sane when I was going through some really dark moments. When I all I did was look in the mirror and hate myself and everything about me. he kept me up and made me feel like I was worth something. 

But aside from all that he was the first person to introduce me to weed at about 18 and that was all we did. It became our thing we'd meet eachother at like 11:30 at night go to this dugout at the baseball field and just get stoned out of our minds play music and just vibe out. We've had so many adventures and near death situations I cant even count. One time we decided to do doordash together and I was getting on the highway at about 40 mph (way too fast) and we spun out hit the grass and did a full 360. If a car was behind us we'd probably be dead. But there was never a dull moment like we would just be laughing joking about anything and everything we were so freakin close. And not only that but we would never argue with eachother like most close friends if there was ever a misunderstanding we talked it out right then and there and most of the time things that would cause friends to drift apart for a while would take us a matter of 30 seconds to solve because we were so dead honest about everything. He is family to me and I'd take a bullet for him.

 You get the picture. Let's skip to the present.


 I'm leaving for the air force in a week. And I told him today like it turns out I'm actually actually leaving in a week because i thought and was telling him that it was gonna be months from now and he says ""I know bro my bad I feel bad I just can't hang out during week cuz I need to be on time for work and I really can't be chilling like that but I have weekends off""




I was just like in my head are you serious right now. You have a matter of a week to spend time with me before I'm gone for four years and that's all you have to say.. anyone can vouch for me when I say I never cry but that brought me to tears. I care so much for this idiot and that's all he has to say. I dont know if I'm crazy or what but if I were in his shoes id be spending every single second with him until he had to go.

My dad passed away about a year and a half ago out of nowhere. We were all so surprised. It was the perfect opportunity for my family to decide I cannot be apart of them anymore because I chose to not be religious. I was forced to be my entire life and as soon as I was an adult and could think for myself, I was done with it. My family unfortunately doesn’t believe in that and completely kicked me to the curb after my dads passing. I haven’t had complete closure yet so I feel a lot of my depression stems from this. 

Since his passing, I’ve moved from my home country (spouse visa). I was struggling to fit in, in my new country and then the pandemic hit. I feel like I’m so lost here. I can’t drive (nobody will insure me because of nationality and age), I obviously can’t get a job so my husband is paying for everything, I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I just feel so unwanted here. And I feel incredibly lonely. 

I’m struggling so much with my depression for the past 2 or so months. I’ve been diagnosed with depression from a young age and it’s never seemed to quite leave. It’s always weighing on me in the back of my mind. 

I just feel so misunderstood by a lot of people in my life. People that haven’t gone through trauma, people that haven’t had depression, I just feel they really can’t relate to me. I feel like my sadness and hopelessness is weighing on my husband. I know he loves me so deeply but I worry that he feels he didn’t sign up for this. Nobody wants a wife who cries so much, feels so awful constantly, doesn’t care to have sex as much as him. He wants that happy, not a care in the world, girl he met so many years ago. I’ve just been through a lot since we met and as much as I want to, I can’t be that woman for him right now. 

I want to be able to just settle down in this country but I feel so uncomfortable. I can’t even talk without someone staring which just leads me to worry, then spiral, as I’m sure some of you know how that goes. I’m not working, I hardly have any friends.

Some say just eating healthy doing workouts socialising and setting a goal helps and it does, for two weeks and there we go again straying further from the silver lining, away from the path i want to go. 
But everyone feels that way from time to time, its okay and totally normal isnt it, so just refocus and find the way back to where you left the road is the solution?
Which should be easy, just do it, feel good, you can?

,depression,"I mean. Im tierd of people not getting what this is. Most people confuse Aphaty with depression. But let me tell you how I see it with my own eyes. Im not here looking for help. Im here to help others if I can.

Depression is like,feeling that you don't belong anywhere. Like... You go to school,you wake up,and you don't wanna go. And it is not because you're getting bullied,or because you can do something more fun than school. It is because in school,you don't feel like you belong there. You feel miserable. But you're strong,so you tell yourself ""i can go through with it,after school things will get better once I graduate"" You go to college or work but you don't feel like you belong there as well. One day you quit your job or you get fired or whatever. And then you're like ""now what?"" like ""I couldn't find my place anywhere. And I just feel empty."" . So now i gotta find myself a job. Well I don't want to go to work. So my choice rn is to either starve to death now. Or work,and die miserable because i didn't do what I wanted to do. That's what it feels like. Like you just don't want to live in a world like this. Like it is just not your place. You don't belong anywhere.  Thats why many depressed people think about suicide. They just want to find a place where they belong. For example: You got some money and you go ahead and buy yourself a new car. You get a Ford. But that Ford just doesn't suit you. You don't like it. So what do you do? You return it and you get a different car. But what if that's life we are talking about,and not a car? Depression is like war. You either win or you die trying. The thing to fight it is to find a place where you belong. And something to fight for. And if you can't well. I won't tell you to kill yourself. But I won't tell you not to. That's something that you decide. And many people might say ""you didn't give your own life,you don't have the right to take it"" . Well... when was the last time you suffered like this to fucking tell me what I have the right to do or not. Or ""Killing yourself is selfish"" It's selfish? Then when was the last time you did something for me? Something that will make me feel better? It is really easy to say shit like this. When you don't know the feeling of being in a crowd and feeling alone. Or to just not find your place. Somewhere you feel like home. So no I don't feel ugly,worthless etc. I feel empty. And no I don't want someone to fucking come and hug me,or kiss me or tell me that it is going to be okay. I just want to find my place. I just want to fill that emptyness and feel happy again. So if you know someone with depression. Don't tell him that it is going to be okay,because he/she heard it like a 1000 times. Just make sure that he/she knows that there is someone for him/her. And if you have depression. Then fight with fangs and claws because let me tell you something. You survived where many people putted a gun in their mouth and pulled the trigger. And that makes you strong.

I ask her if everything&amp;#39;s okay and she reassures me that it is when I do. Well, today, I brought her to work and brought her some lunch to her job and she breaks it to me that she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be in a relationship anymore.  No cues or anything, just sorry bye. She got her stuff and left the apartment after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I shake back from this? I&amp;#39;m depressed at home at the moment and I don&amp;#39;t want to feel this way the next couple of weeks. We lived together and had a really decent system going with it now ending with me going to bed alone and waking up alone picking up the slack. I just want my mojo back. I put forth the most in that relationship than anyone before, and I didn&amp;#39;t even get a reason in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

two years ago, because i did something really, really stupid, i missed out on a scholarship. a pretty big one. kinda huge. id been working towards it all my life, and then, because i was 17 and stupid, missed out. i was told later that i was guaranteed to have gotten it. it felt like a gut punch.

i just started my second year in college. im lucky, my parents pay my tuition, though its not easy for them. i know how lucky i am. truly. but i cant get that failure out of my mind. im consumed with regret, and guilt, and shame. i hate myself, and sometimes wake up genuinely believing i cant go on because of how worthless i feel. i keep thinking about the money, and feel like i want to throw up. i constantly compare myself with those who did get the scholarship, and feel like a spoilt, unworthy freeloader. my self esteem is basically non-existent. i think about killing myself all the time, but just cant do it- i like uni, i like being me, i like being alive. at least when im not thinking about that. it just hurts, so much. im sorry if these dont sound like real or rational problems, but goddamn it hurts. 

i did pretty ok my first year, good grades, threw myself into work and uni life so i wouldnt have to stop and think about all of this. it went by in one exhausting flash. but my first semester in second year was spent in total isolation due to covid. basically just me, in a strange city, alone in a room, unemployed due to layoffs, with nothing to do but study and obsess. i had a total breakdown. i kept bursting into tears and feeling so empty inside id just sit on my bed for hours staring into space, lost in the past, thinking about all the things i hoped to add to my cv to ease that feeling to guilt this term and feeling like nothing could ever give me hope again. i came very close to hurting myself.

i’ve been off my meds for a year a half now (i think) and honestly i wish i still had them. not for the purpose of taking them because i’d flush them down the toilet anyway because all they did to me was make me sleepy and gain weight, don’t know if it actually made me feel better. i want them so i can have a capsule of pills ready to OD on. now i have to actually research what pills actually work so i can die successfully lolllll. do i need to be like rediagnosed or something? 

nothing gives me enjoyment like it used to when i was younger. maybe it’s my fault that i don’t go out, but when i do, i still come home to the same gut feeling of wanting to die. i still hate myself. still cry myself to sleep. and then i lock myself in my room and play video games, watch shows, or scroll through social media that increases my hatred of living until i come out occasionally to binge eat unhealthily. i have texts either left on delivered or read because i’ve never felt a real connection in such a long time. everyone’s just a big blurb in my life and it’s hard being a people pleaser. i’m dissociating from everyone, including my friends and family. especially thanks to quarantine! it’s bad, but i’m just..comfortable this way, you know what i mean? 

there’s absolutely NO drive in my life. nothing exciting that i’m looking forward to. no relationships to keep me going. no motivation to move and keep going. EVERYDAY is just a challenge to hold on to a reason to keep living. i hate and am so anxious for school to start again even though summer practically just started. i know my few friendships that survived this pandemic and my family (most of them) will be sad when i’m gone, and i know this sounds a bit mean, but sorry not sorry lmao. no one really cares now, so they’re gonna start caring when i’m gone? ummmmm, yeah, thanks. 

my therapist probably is disappointed in me, not a new feeling though. i hate that i’m so selfish that there’s other people suffering too with way more worse reasons like they’re literally homeless, which makes me even more depressed. like wow i am really just that fucking stupid. there’s just nothing to strive for. the clubs i’m in? no enjoyment anymore. the times i hang out with my friends? no enjoyment anymore. the video games? the relationships? the laughter, smiles? no real enjoyment. i’m living in an empty shell of a girl who used to enjoy, well, living. there’s no one i can really express to anymore that won’t treat me differently.

&lt;p&gt;there’s absolutely NO drive in my life. nothing exciting that i’m looking forward to. no relationships to keep me going. no motivation to move and keep going. EVERYDAY is just a challenge to hold on to a reason to keep living. i hate and am so anxious for school to start again even though summer practically just started. i know my few friendships that survived this pandemic and my family (most of them) will be sad when i’m gone, and i know this sounds a bit mean, but sorry not sorry lmao. no one really cares now, so they’re gonna start caring when i’m gone? ummmmm, yeah, thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my therapist probably is disappointed in me, not a new feeling though. i hate that i’m so selfish that there’s other people suffering too with way more worse reasons like they’re literally homeless, which makes me even more depressed. like wow i am really just that fucking stupid. there’s just nothing to strive for. the clubs i’m in? no enjoyment anymore. the times i hang out with my friends? no enjoyment anymore. the video games? the relationships? the laughter, smiles? no real enjoyment. i’m living in an empty shell of a girl who used to enjoy, well, living. there’s no one i can really express to anymore that won’t treat me differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyways, imma just stick it out until the school year comes around again. it’ll give me more of a reason to not pussy myself out of doing it :) have a nice day everybody&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm worried that I wont ever find a medication that helps my depression, anxiety and OCD. This is going to be really long-winded, sorry.

Here is a little backstory, I guess. I should mention that 4 years before I was actually diagnosed with depression I had started abusing prescription painkillers that ultimately turned in to a 10 year struggle with addiction. I have been clean from illicit drugs (heroin and cocaine was what I was doing before I quit) for almost 5 years, but I am still in a drug treatment program. So keep in mind I was also abusing drugs during this time.

Anyway, I'm 28. I was formally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD after I graduated in 2010, after my two best friends were both killed in a car accident. I took Lexapro and klonopin for many many years with no real side effects but I never felt that it helped, I just didn't care enough about myself to try other things. I quit taking Lexapro at some point, and didn't take any kind of anti depressant for a long time, up until 2015 when I started going to a new doctor. I took Wellbutrin for a while, got up to 300mg but didn't think it was helping, so I quit taking it after 4 or 5 months.

Fast forward to this year, I started going to a new doctor and she prescribed me whatever the generic version of Lexapro is. I took it one time. I had THE WORST reaction to it. It was the worst panic attack I have ever had combined with a weird metallic taste in my mouth and I would get waves of this weird ""cold"" discomfort and then I would get really hot. Needless to say I didn't even bother trying to take it again. I went back and was prescribed 150mg Wellbutrin, took it for about 5 months, told my doctor that I didn't notice a real difference, so she suggested adding Zyprexa 5mg to help with my anxiety and my OCD. I haven't been taking the Zyprexa long, but I'm not expecting much. I also take Gabapentin for panic attacks and to help sleep. I cant be prescribed benzos because of my drug history.

TLDR: Taken a couple different medications for depression, anxiety, and OCD. Never noticed a difference when taking them. Scared that I'll have to jump from pill to pill trying something new and will never find something that helps. Would like to hear from others about how long it took to find a winning combination. Thanks.  

\*Edit: I'm also curious to know that if anyone that takes Wellbutrin gets crazy bad headaches from it. I have a history of migraines, so I am familiar with what it feels like when one is coming on, and that's what the headaches that I started getting after starting Wellbutrin feel like.

,depression,"Life is depressing. I find it very difficult to function normally in our society. Every year that goes by the further I slip into this void. Life consumed by darkness. Shutting myself away from it all. None of it makes me happy... Its like i'm broken. 

So for the last few years I've been isolating myself. Fear and depression control me. Anxiety keeps me from being social and out going. Not to mention i'm a complete WRECK rn.. 

I don't take good care of myself. I don't see a point to. Why should I care what people think when they will be gone out of my life in a few months or so. The people who never left are my true friends and I have very few that I can actually bet on. Other than these people, I just don't care.. 

When it comes to work, im not lazy. I work really hard and my anxiety MAKES me work hard because I want to be valuable in the eyes of my peers. However, the expenses of life are to great. Working for 40+ hours, week by week. Just to stay where your at and be able to get back to work week after week. I cannot save any money to save my life. Ive had jobs making 13 an hour, ive had jobs where I was making 1000+ a week, I've had jobs making 300 a week. It does not matter. Money never sticks around. Between bills, necessities, entertainment and anything else you pay week to week or month to month there's just nothing left.  

I like having something to do and its even better when I got good people around I enjoy. But the problem is its still a life of treading water. Everything in our society is designed to make the vast majority of us debt slaves to have a decent life. They want you to be an employee. You think your gonna get this new job and you make a financial plan to save something and it never goes the way you thought it would.  Maybe today your tires blows up, or tomorrow you break your ankle. Anytime things are going good, shit happens. Nd 90% of us could not quit our jobs RN and be good for more than a few months tops. Yet we spend more than half of our waking time doing something we don't want to do for someone who's capitalizing off of your labor. Nd all of em tell you some fairy tell shit about how to be successful and wealthy, like any of us can just up and start a business and BOOM. 

Like it don't take a SHIT ton of collateral already saved up and all the kinks are ironed out as far as licensing and insurance and all that shit. Talking bout fear is why people don't take risks, MONEY is why people don't take risks, the lack of money.  

The cold hard TRUTH is none of us are really meant to be successful and retire. Were meant to be AS PRODUCTIVE as possible for whatever the minimal amount of compensation is at this time. Look at amazon, jeff bezos is the worlds richest man, and not to say he doesn't deserve his wealth because... HE DOES, instead of sharing the profits with his employees, he is starting his own fucking SPACE EXPLORATION FACILTY. YEAH, Jeff bezos is MAKING his own NASA. Give it a decade, he will be like Weyland-Yutoni. I mean fuck it its america right. If he wants to be a greedy fuck let him be a greedy fuck. Lets ignore companies like ford who actually do profit shares and bonuses for their employees. Theyre one of the few companies that actually profit share and give huge 4000 dollar bonuses to EVERY employee multiple times a year sometimes. 

Nd trust me Ide love to go work for ford but I cant because I cant quit smoking weed. I cant stop smoking weed because its the only thing that allows peace inside me. I cannot sleep without weed, cannot feel good without weed. My depression, 10x worse. Anxiety? 10x worse. Infact, not having weed has caused me to literally quit jobs at the drop of the hat. 

I just dont see a point to life you know? You either spend your life as a debt slave, going from one thing to the next, one problem after the other. Stressful event after stressful event. Nd you go NOWHERE but back to work, cause your shackled to all your various payments OR your a minimalist. 

Who is constantly struggling for money, constantly asking for help and paying people back, literally going day by day just trying to get by. 

Both of them are depressing life styles to me and it makes me wonder whats even the point? 

Whats the point of living in this world. I don't understand how everyone isn't blowing their brains out. 

All were doing is sacrificing the time we have in this world for other people to go out on vacations and buy condo's. We work so they can save up for a bigger house or a new car. People who will retire as millionaires. While almost all of their employees will more than likely spend the majority of their life working for a weeks pay thatll never save over in the long run. 

I realize this isn't most peoples problems, these are mine. Most people wont be able to relate to what im talking about or understand. Trust me im not proud of myself rn. I havent been in some time. Ive tried so many times to fix myself with pure discipline. Nd I cant... Living makes me want to die pretty much no matter what, the only comfort I can find is wrapped in a grape flavored wrap. Nd I know thats a sad life. Theres nothing you could say that could hurt me more than I hurt myself. I just dont know what to do. Nd im scared one day, ill end up committing suicide. Like I feel like im already on the edge and ive been living there for prolly atleast 4 years now. I used to be hopeful.. I never expected to be this way when I was growing up.

,depression,"21M - I've had mild depression for like, 8 years now. Shit sucks man. Also diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

Background:

Grew up in a poor neighborhood, dealt with some (admittedly minor, but still affected me greatly) bullying (I didn't handle it well). When I turned 13 I was isolated from the world, even from my parents to some extent. When I did open up, I was told to ""get over it"" (but they have become more understanding and supportive as time has passed, thankfully). Wasted my teen years away playing games and not getting out and socializing, was bullied online and in real life for being poorly educated. Parents fought and argued quite a bit (some really, REALLY bad shit went down) which increased my anxiety. I went to a shitty school where I was breaking down crying in class while a bunch of rowdy kids were yelling and screaming constantly (I am really sensitive to noise, so that wasn't too fun). I literally refused to go because I couldn't bear it. Went to online school, which was actually good for me, but again, less time spent socializing and more time alone. Learned all of my stuff from there and research on the internet. Ended up eventually moving to a small town, moved in with my uncle. Eventually he kicked me and my parents out. Had to spend a few nights in a hotel with hardly any money. Thankfully to our efforts we were able to get us into an apartment complex. Currently have bills, credit card debt, and all this other mental shit going that's been stressing me out and now I gotta focus on finding a job. Things have gotten better, but I still feel shitty on a day to day basis. I know this will probably pass, but damn I just have to talk about it sometimes, you know? I've been so silent on all of these horrible feelings I've had, I just have to talk about them sometimes. I stay silent so long because I developed a hardworking, no-bullshit, and no excuses attitude growing up around the people I did.

&amp;#x200B;

How my depression makes me feel:

\-No energy

\-No motivation to get tasks done or try new things

\-Things that brought me joy before now hardly bring me, if any, joy at all

\-A lot of self isolation, due to lacking motivation to form social connections (it's hard to where I live, don't have a license yet and not a lot of social activities here, especially for young people. So I'm kinda stuck at this location for a bit).

\-I sleep like pure shit. Always wake up not wanting to get out of bed, have a hardass time falling asleep.

\-Always selling myself short. Always talking myself down. Negative and uncomfortable thoughts. Therapy has helped get rid of these.

,depression,"I'm really hurting right now.  I'm on a family trip.  This week my therapist and one of the only friends left in my city told me to enjoy my trip, mentioned how fortunate or wonderful it was I could go.  I had a lot of anxiety on the flight because I possibly let someone cut in front of me in line to board and someone behind me said something passive aggressive about it.  I felt like I couldn't tell anyone because it didn't feel real, I felt like I was panicking for no reason and there was no reason I couldn't just stop panicking.  Two hours after I arrived, my mom was talking with my dad when I walked in, and she was crying and said she didn't feel like I loved her and that she was hurt because she had raised me and now I didn't want to be around her.  Over the years I've been spending gradually more time with my sister and aunt and less with my mom because they encourage me to be myself and celebrate my self expression while she criticizes and judges me.  She also said not to tell my aunt.  She was really upset, so I agreed.

,depression,"Hi all. 

This is something I’ve been dwelling over for a long time. I hate my life. I hate my job. Not new for this subreddit I know. I went to University, dropped out over some misplaced fear of failure. Now I’m stuck in a dead end retail job. Without intending to brag at all, I’m rather intelligent, or so I understand. I have a constant fight with my ego. That I don’t deserve to be stuck in a supermarket, that I’m better than my colleagues. Then that I deserve to be here for my failure and I’m human just as them, the same. I’ve written a few things, got plenty of drafts out, that authoring may rescue me from this life. But the world of potential authors is so saturated, I doubt I would even stand out. 

I read. A lot. Especially on the lives of ‘Great’ ones. It’s hard to read about Washington, Napoleon, Nelson, Frederick Douglass etc. And look at my own life and consider it worthwhile. Twenty-four and stuck in retail...I’d love to join the Army or Navy, as an officer, start to climb the ladder. But I have a fiancé I love very much and I would be too fearful of her roaming to leave. I trust her, there’s just this intense fear.

Every day that I start at 4-5am, I think to myself, I could just leave a note, tell my family not to inform the emergency services so as to not waste their time. Put on my walking gear and just going. Getting some money out of a cash machine to survive for a bit, sleeping in the wilderness, taking my favourite book Cosmos. I’d be to scared to commit suicide in the wild. I wouldn’t want some poor innocent person to find me. That’s why I’ve put it off for so long, I don’t want anyone to suffer that situation. Especially not family. I just want to go and see at least some serenity of the world, away from all the hustle and bustle. 

My plan was to hang myself. As I’m about to drop, dial an ambulance and they’ll send one. It just feels so selfish. I tried, but my belt snapped...good job I didn’t call them. 

The worst part about suicidal feelings is the feeling of being trapped. You don’t want to live and you don’t want to cause people upset by leaving. It is such a huge dichotomy in feeling that can’t be compartmentalised.

,depression,"Good evening people of Reddit, specifically those who follow r/depression. 
I am Peter and I am a person who suffered/suffers with SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder. Aka Seasonal Depression. 
So you may be asking, who tf cares, get to the point but I would like to share my perspective when it comes to depression and how to make it more bearable/tolerable. Keep in mind I am not here to CURE you as much as that would be amazing, like I mentioned before I continue to suffer from SAD for 4 years now. What SAD exactly is, is that during the months of winter, (for me at least) depressive symptoms emerge and eventually blossom into a season of depression. Last year, my depressive symptoms emerged during mid-September and lasted for 6 months up until April of this year. Specifically March 14. Pi Day. So peterlovespie has two meanings now. Anyways, I don’t know what you all are going through, as one of my favorite quotes says, “We’re ALL in the SAME game, just different levels; dealing with the SAME Hell, just DIFFERENT devils” which is very very true. Even with depression we all have different ways to cope, think, and that’s all fine. There’s no two depressive episodes that are EXACTLY the same. Much like snowflakes. But my symptoms included numbness, shortness of breath, a side of anxiety, insomnia and much much more. However, I did have an outlet to let out my innermost thoughts out there when I either didn’t have friends to be with me or I didn’t go to them because I was scared. Scared of being judged, laughed at, or even worse trying to understand then have them try to help me to make things worse. I wrote poems in my early stages. (If you’d like me to share them, please let me know in the comments) and then after a month or two. I shut down. I couldn’t get myself to get up, write a poem, eat, sleep, ANYTHING. So, I get why we’re perceived as lazy. But I know WE’RE NOT. Furthermore, my friends started to take notice of my behavior shift and tried to help out but as the aforementioned fears state, it made matters a bit worse. But, I did open up to my closest friends but they didn’t really do much but give advice which is the last thing I needed to hear. Fast forward to April, I started to  get back into the groove of playing piano again and soon enough my season was up. I could finally see the colors that my mind turned into grayscale, feel the warmth of an embrace, I know most of you are either suffering right now or know somebody who is suffering and to you I say, there are 3 types of people with depression need:
1. A friend to shut up and listen
2. A friend to give them space when needed
3. An accountability friend that checks up on them maybe once a month

If there’s more, lmk in the comments but that’s basically all I need to get off my chest. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: Depression really sucks, and you WILL get through this.

,depression,"It's actually been a lot of the time, more and more. I hate my life, I hate myself, I hate everything. I just want to be ok and happy, but I don't think that'll ever happen. Life's always been shit. 

I'm 22, unemployed and living with my parents, I've never had an actual serious relationship. I'm a failure. I see everyone else I went to school with and they're either settled on their own with a family and career or finishing college with some great degree. Ive done nothing but suffer and have been on a spiral downward and I can't take it. My life was ruined, this world hates me. 

When I school I learned how fucked up the world is.

I have ptsd nightmares. I hate being awake and I hate sleeping. I don't know how many nights I've hurt myself to stay awake and I don't know how many nights I've cried myself to sleep. 

Ive lost the only friends I've had and I can't make new ones. I can't let people get close to me, I freak out and push them away when they get to close. I'm lonely but I'm worthless. I wish I was someone else. I just want to feel normal and I don't think I ever will.

,depression,"I've always been depressed most of my teenage life. Everytime I manage to find or work something good for me, the world takes it away from me. This isn't just about the events of 2020 and how everyone has gotten hit hard. This is about my whole life. In the 17 years that I've been alive.

My parents are Muslims, they were born in Morocco from extensive families with no money, my father brought them to Denmark, where me and my sister were born. They both worked hard from poverty to a normal and quiet life for all of us. I was the firstborn and my sister was born 1.5 years later. We lived in a nice and friendly town, my father worked in the capital that was a hour drive away (or so it felt like a hour drive, could had been 30 mins). I had a lot friends there and really good teachers, I did my homework in time with good results and I was a pretty normal kid, my best friend lived in the neighbourhood and we would always visit each other.

Our normal yearly schedule was that my father worked all days except Monday and Tuesday, he was Co chief of the restaurant and kept it going when the owner wasn't there. Every summer, we would go to Morocco where all of our families were coming aswell and come back before the next school year, we always slept at our grandparents home. Eventually, my parents saved and built a house in Morocco next to my grandparents of my mother's side new home.

But then shit hit the fan, I reached 4th grade I think at the age of 10 and my parents suddenly decided we were gonna move out. I later found out that my mother was depressed in Denmark and wanted to move out, she was a housewife.

We moved to Málaga, Spain. I was forced to abandon to all my friends and I didn't even have the strength to say I was moving, my teachers said that for me. I only managed to keep contact with one person, my best friend.

I was forced to learn a new language in a new cultural setting, the kids there were terrible, not even the clown of my class in Denmark could compare to them. I had not made a single decent friend ever.

In the 2 years we lived in Málaga, we moved between two flats and changed two schools. My father still worked in Denmark, staying there for many months and coming to visit us for a few weeks. I had not made a single friend and I repeated a grade. 

A little explanation to Spains school system, there are 3 different grades for age groups, primary (x-12, ESO (13-16 meaning secondary) and bachelor (17-18). Primary had 6 years, secondary had 4 and bachelor had 2.

Since I moved, I kept contact with my best friend and we only played one thing together, Minecraft. I didn't own Minecraft until I was 13, we always played in cracked servers together, almost everyday. That's all I could do. 

We moved again, this time to Melilla, because it was so close to our home in Morocco. I only attended one year there in one apartment. I was 12 and attended 5th primary, I was supposed to attend 6th but my vocabulary skills could not keep up, halfway through the school year, the school placed me down to 4th primary just so I could manage, I was put with kids 2 years younger than me. 

After that, we moved AGAIN. This time, to Barcelona... Or so we though, we spent a few weeks in Barcelona at my aunts home from my fathers side, my parents tried to look for a home and school that spoke castellano, because in the province of Barcelona, they spoke catalán. We never settled there and drove the roads of Spain again, we finally settled into the right city. Granada. 

I should thank you for reading this far, because while this part will be the best, it's also the worst. 

Our first year in Granada was alright, I skipped 6th primary because of my age, I was put into 1st ESO with linguistic help. I found my strong points and weak points in the curriculum. I developed a disgust for Spanish literature and Geography History. We moved between two flats in the first year, I should also say that my contact with my friend has declined by ALOT. This was due to lack of Internet for many months and its removal many times. 

I had become 13 and my hormones and shit started, in my first year, I still didn't make real friends but I made ""friends"". The bullying still continued though, but I started to stand up to myself and got branded a chivato (a snitch). 

The teenagers of Spain are by far the most toxic and insensible people I've ever seen. And they all get away with it. I started getting into fights. 

After my first year, I swapped school for my 2nd ESO, nothing changed and I was still surrounded by douchebags and fake friends. While still failing at the same subjects. But I made my first friend, a kid from Ecuador. I had never had such a good friend since Denmark, we played together Cod and visited each other. But nothing last forever I guess, instead of me being the one moving out, it was him. I stopped contacting him after 2 years. 

3rd ESO, age 14. My mom placed me in the best school of the city and we had just finished renovations for our new flat that my parents had a loan to buy for. 

I loved this school, its very building had the sense of freedom Denmark gave me, although not completely since its still got fences and shit, but still much more breathable. I passed my first few weeks there enjoying and meeting people, I thought I could make things different here. Guess not really. Did I fail to mention that my mom didn't come with us from our last summer vacation? It was me, my sister and my father in the first few weeks of that schoolyear. 

My father went to Morocco to talk things out with my mother, left me and my sister home alone for a few days with cash and food. I was 14, she was 12 and attended 1st ESO on my school. When my father came back, he packed our things one day after arriving and we went to Morocco. 

There are 3 terms in Spains schoolyear, one lasting 3 months. 

My parents were divorcing, and it was fucking messy. We spent the whole first term there, my parents put us in a private Moroccan school, we had to pay for fucking everything when Spain offered it for free. I was forced to attend a school system that had 3 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening, we rode a private cab every fucking day and there was even school in the weekends. 

My father became so fucking obsessed with keeping  everyone together, he had us involved. And it hurt my sister a lot. At the end of it all, my mom took us back to Granada, and my father lost his job trying to keep things together by the next year.

I failed 3rd ESO, I got back to it by the 2nd term, never had the will to put effort after that shit of a divorce, but hey, I found my first friendgroup, a real friendgroup. I had found my love for anime and this friendgroup, although mostly consisted of girls, shared that love of anime and videogames. Particularly 3 friends. 

In all these years, I had been so alone and gained no social interactions, I found it always hard to start convos and surprised how easily accepting they were of other new people and how they grew friendlier faster than what I could. 

I repeated 3rd ESO along with 1 of those 3 friends. Turns out I found this one friend to be relatable, she had her parents divorce at the same year as mine, her mother was from Morocco and although she didn't move around, she never had friends until 1st ESO where she met the other 2 friends. As the repeat year passed, I grew to like that girl but later understood that friendship is better.

Life was hard after the divorce, the debts we owed the bank started pilling up and my father had financial trouble to help along, but I mother saw it as an excuse. She never brought us in, she was always defending herself, but now she became just as dumb as my father was. She revealed to my sister, that my father had married another woman and had a son, the woman died after birth and he left the firstborn in a orphanage, I was never the firstborn. She revealed this to my sister first, after that to me. I was confused, my sister started hating my dad. It would only be years after I realize, my mother is the one who truly caused the downfall of my sister. She never had a reason to reveal that. To this day, I haven't talked about it with my dad. 

I found my profession, I wasnt fully sure but I wanted to do something with art, I started drawing since I moved to Melilla, it helped me cope and I had grown to become good, I was always the best one in class until I met that girl,whose art was much better than mine.

I passed 3rd ESO and went into 4th ESO, I decided I wanted to do bachelor of arts and get into the art school of Granada. I made a lot more friends that year and learned more about them, I became more open but still had to deal with douchebags. I also learned that girl had a half brother just as old as my half brother, only difference being they live together with their common mother. I found the coincidence to be fascinating, as if the cosmos brought two people of the same background life together. 

Me and that girl both wanted to go to art school, we both applied and got denied. We had both given up hope, my mother didn't though. She went to a place where all the school applications is handled and applied me there, after summer, me and my sister were sent to Granada alone, my mother would come two weeks after. She had told me to go check on my application, I didn't want to because I knew J wouldn't get accepted. I lied and she ended up going herself, they told us we would be contacted once the schoolyear started.

In the time that me and my sister were homealone, my sister was prohibited from leaving alone or having friends over, I let her have some fun. Biggest mistake ever. The only reason I allowed her was because I had been sneaking my laptop out of my mother's room every night before she went to sleep, so I could use it for some time when I was grounded from it, my sister knew that and took that as a favor.

I should say this, at the end, my parents sold the flat and split the cash, my mom didn't want to split the cash, she wanted 75% for ""us"", my father knew better that she has become a money hogger. And took the 50% himself. My mother rented a new flat and my father bought me a new PC for my career. 

Once the schoolyear started, it was my first day of bachelor of socials. My friends were still in the same school, that girl came to class a bit late though. After I came home that day, my mother got a call in the evening, I was accepted into the school of arts. 

Day 2 of the schoolyear, we spent the morning doing paperwork and all that, day 3 I went to my school to get myself removed and say goodbye to my friends, I also found out the math teacher was a complete douchebags who thinks i should had informed him that I didn't come to school at day 2. Glad I ain't seeing him. I only regret not saying goodbye to that girl, I thought that it would only hurt her if she found out that I got in and she didn't. Since she was the one who informed me about that school of arts. 

My time at the school of arts was marvelous. You don't get a better chance to make new friends when everyone doesn't know each other. I made real friends I could trust and there was never a single douchebag ever. It was a paradise. 

Shit hit the fan again. Worse than anything. 

My sister made a new habit, going to the library almost everyday. After a few days, I suspected something and told my mother, my mother spied on her somehow and grounded her. She wasn't going to the library, she was hanging out with her ""friends"". 

It was only 2 weeks before a convention for weebs and gamers. Something me and my sister attended every year for the past 4 years in Granada. She was banned from going there and my sister got mad. 

The day it happened, she ran away from home, after I came home and learned about what she did, we went to look for her. We came home with no luck and she didn't even wait at the door. Next morning she came home and was grounded harder. 

It was only a matter of time. One day I came home from school, we were waiting for my sister, she usually takes 5 min tops to come home after me. She didn't come, I got a call from a classmate of my previous school where my sister is still attending. She found her in the nearby playground, drunk, without her sweater on. Ambulance took her to the hospital.

We went there, my mother almost fucking fainted and cried her eyes out. I was fucking shocked, I already had bad relations and fought with her a lot but I never expected her to go bad bitch like this. 

Worse of all, that school had 3 yearly meetings informing about dangers of alcohol, sex, and other shit to students. This has been taught 3x every year and she was always there. 

I spent in the hospital the entire evening, waiting for her to get sober. She had intoxicated herself with vodka. A boy came saying he was with her, he looked old but claimed to be the same age, I trusted him. I also looked old but was younger than people though. 

He explained what happened and she had drank vodka. He spoke with police and was let go. My mother knew he was lying. 

I went home alone, barely managed to catch the last metro of the night. I sat on the couch and saw myself see that everything was a fucking lie to my sister. 

My sister was allowed to go home, and they both came home. We didn't ask her anything, we just let her rest. 

By the next day, she said she couldn't remember anything, that it was all a blur. I had made contact with her friends and the school, she had been skipping school. 

The questions started and thus, our family was no more a family, she became violent, disrespectful, she didn't want to speak, she attacked my mom and wanted to break my new laptop. We had police come to our home 3x to knock some sense to her.

She left her Instagram open and I found everything I needed to know, yet there was more. She had been sexting, talking drugs and when to get them, all that shit. And the one friend who we knew the most and that my mother trusted, knew about this and lied to my face about ever fucking knowing. 

We brought her to a government funded institution to help smokers better themselves. She didn't want the treatment, thinking she is fine but we forced her. She was scheduled to get back next month. 

Things calmed down, but not. She was expelled and spent the rest of the term in her home, my mom did not want to look for a school until she got some treatment, when she did get treatment, there was no school that could accept her


Halfway through the first term. A new student joined my class. Turns out, the same method my mother used is the method the new kid used to get in, and it still works. I contacted that girl about it and she was excited to do it. 3 days later and she joined my class, I introduced her to my classmates and my friend group who we were already really good friends with and she fit in nicely. 

What felt like was hard to obtain friendship for me in those 3 years in the last ESO school, suddenly became so easy in the 3 months of the first term. 

My grades were good, REALLY good. I had never gotten such good grades in Spanish before, I had the best Spanish teacher ever, using methods no other teacher ever used. I got a 8 when the highest I ever got was a 5. My low self esteem for the bachelor started boosting. I was confident in my studies for once. 

I found my real profession, video-game design, I started to learn programming, slowly but surely. I was waiting the most important date to truly start, 2020 new years resolution. 

She ran away, my sister, after being trapped in our house for many weeks and only allowed outside with my mom, took my keys and ran away. The door was always locked, we never trusted her. She did not come back home that night and we found her outside the next day, lying about throwing my keychain away. My mom had decided. 

She wanted to move away, back to Melilla. 

Day after day, I tried to convince her not to, that she could get treatment and we will find a school 

I even fucking told her that its OK if she repeats the year because I FUCKING REPEATED A YEAR AND IMPROVED MYSELF AS A PERSON. 

She didn't care, all she could see was a way out, where she didn't had to deal with the law and could ""save"" my sister, but at what cost does my mom think she can save her daughter? 

The 1st term was over, and my mom started packaging, we went from finally getting rid of that debt to my mom loaning 2k euros from her brothers to move between Granada and Morocco 6x with a fully loaded car. 

Her first trip, it was new years eve, I still planned to follow through with my new year's resolutions, after my mom left and it was just me and my sister alone, she took the opportunity, found my hidden key spot while I was sleeping and left. I spent new years eve alone, thus started 2020. 

I informed my mom immediately, for my resolutions I wanted to learn game development everyday and took personal hygiene properly, I even exercised everyday. This lasted only 3 days. 

My mom came back quick, my sister returned home and went back to her room with nothing to say, I told my mother everything to do to check her, we found my keys in her sockets and tobacco in her bra. She isn't just a manipulative liar anymore, she is also an expert of keeping secrets, luckily for my mom. Those years of having no friends have taught me how people act. 

My mom took another trip with the car loaded, this time I took better precautions, kept the key and cash with me at all times, when I slept, I would put it inside my pillow, in an unreachable place. Imagine my horror when I woke up at 8 Am, to my sister standing over my bed, I knew she was looking for the keys, I told her to get out and I went back to sleep. She came back inside my room asking for the TV cable, she was not allowed to watch TV without supervision. I told her to fuck off and go to sleep. I eventually gave in, she started making breakfast and told me to go take a bath cause I was stinking, it seemed liked a normal morning. I took my keys and cash into the bathroom and hid them in the cubicles, while I was taking a bath, she slowly creeped in and took the keys then races outside, I was forced to leave my bath and wear clothes quickly, she got away. 


I felt betrayed and violated, I didn't want to do my resolutions, I reached depression once again. She eventually came back after a few days, I didn't want to let her in but I had no choice. When my mom came back, she took her with her on the next trip. 

Christmas vacation was almost over, every day alone in that stupid house felt like torture, I never knew living alone in a medium sized flat felt so exhausting, I never had the strength to write in my class WhatsApp that I was moving, not until the first day of the 2nd term. 

My friends sent me alot of messages saying how they will miss me, even the girl, I told her what happened cause she knew my sister and she was shocked. 

The very resolutions I planned to myself, the new me, was a failure immediatly.

After 7 years of moving out of Denmark all around Spain, after living in Granada for 5 years. I had finally regained my social abilities and found real friends in an environment of my own choosing that I'm happy with, only to have it all stripped away by the very same person who decided that we were gonna move 7 years ago.


The first half of the 2nd term was wasted in moving, I was stuck in Morocco with my mom wasting her time doing personal shit, she never even prioritised finding a new home in Melilla, our new flat ended up being a very small flat that my mom was paying slightly more than what we did in Granada. We managed to get WiFi in our home in Morocco, but in Melilla, we didn't have any WiFi until the very day that Spain went into lockdown. 

I spent the remaining 2nd term in depression, playing games during the weekdays and suffering with the WiFi in Morocco, which we are paying more for a speed of 12mbps when we had 300mbps for less price, with much better infrastructure and latency. 

The online games that I played usually became nothing but sources of stress after the move due to the inferiority of the new WiFi. 

I did find friends in my new art school, but that place was worse than my last ESO school, the teachers barely cared and their system was drastically different, what became a understandable and slowly enjoyable Spanish subject for me now reverted back to the same disgust I had for it for the whole of ESO. 

half of the class consisted of douchebags, and 99% of the class doesn't even draw. Only 4 out of 40 can draw and only 3 do it with passion. Inclusing me. The rest are there because they think bachelor of arts is easier to do. 

The school itself was a joke, we were sharing classes with a ESO school, whose school building did not finish building and they were ""allowed"" to operate in the school of arts of melilla. 

Worst of all, what was the reason we came here? To help my sister recover, she didn't. She stole a bottle of vodka and sold it to a homeless person, she also stored alcohol in her water bottle and hid it in her backpack. I told to my mom that day ""I warned you, once you are in it, you never leave. My sister will not recover, she will not listen, and whenever she finds the chance again, she will do it again. We moved away from the best life opportunies for nothing"" 

Nearing the end of 2nd term, exams were coming. We already had the habit of going to Morocco on weekends, the border would take hours to pass through. One day, school ended on a Thursday, I had an exam on the evening. (Did I mention they do exams on the evening??? And their exams are supposed to last 2 hours unlike the usual 1 hour? And every Tuesday, class starts one hour earlier but still ends the same time?) my mom didn't want to wait, I wanted to do the exam. She told me I could cross the border on foot and wait for the WiFi technicians to come. I accepted. 

She forgot to leave the passport to me. She took my laptop, the WiFi got installed and I did my exam. After packing up and sending a msg to my mom that I'm coming. I went out and locked the door. 

I arrived to the border on foot, turns out, there was a lot of people than normally. Little did I know, the president just announced that Spain is going on lockdown and that Morocco is closing the border on Friday. Had I chosen to stay the night, I would had been stuck in Melilla with no cash to live on and no way to leave.

The Moroccan side of the border stopped me, they normally never ask for passport since anyone who does enter Morocco is definitely moroccan but they did for me. I didn't have it and they brought me to the office, after some talking, a guard offered me Internet to call my mom. She came and picked me up.

The lockdown happened and online school began. I had to wake up 1 hour earlier just to be able to attend it. It was hellish.

I was already depressed as shit, knowing I barely escaped the border and being stuck in melilla, I knew it was gonna happen eventually but I didn't expect it like that.

Online school was a fucking mess, the 2nd term was over and I failed it.

Once the 3rd term started, timezones had changed and now I had to wake up 2 hours earlier, I was done with it.

Any class that was too early, I gave up on. I tried attending any I could, but I would always overslept and miss most classes, before I know it, I had missed so many assignments and classes, chances of me succeeding the year was impossible. I gave up, never attended or responded for the rest of the term. 


Every fucking night, I would lay awake wondering how the fuck did I get here. How did my dad abandon my half brother and if I should seek him out. How my mother came to the conclusion that her easily resolvable mental health was more important than our growth as kids. How my parents act more children than adults. 

Will I ever get out of this mess? Is my dream even still possible? Will I ever get to see my friends again? 
Will I see her, the girl who helped me cope after my parents divorced and I helped her have a chance in her dreams? 

My mom says everything she does is for us, she has given all her house cut (50k euros) to my dad for his new restaurant in Netherlands. Money that could had been used to never make another loan, money that could had paid my college expenses (2k euros).

Even in debt, my mom has had the audacity to buy a 4k TV, to make small renovations and constructions in our house in Morocco. Even a modern day US college student wouldn't do this if he had the cash. 


It just hurts so much, and everytime I try to open up to my mom about this, she makes this about herself, that she risked it all for us. 

She says she will never go back to Granada, and my only chance of getting back would be if I pass 1st bachelor and she would rent a student apartment, something expensive and that I cannot do. 


I've read a lot about people's life stories, their ups and downs, and how they always get their good ending. I don't see a good ending, I see myself having been born with all the opportunities and being dragged down to a land where labor pays worst. 

I don't know, if I ever will get the motivation to restart my learning in game development, I have ideas, great ideas but I just can't manage to stop depressing myself, I'm afraid that this cycle will repeat and that nothing will matter because my life is the same cycle of ""give me something good, give me something even worse"" 


I don't want to die, I just want to be happy. I would prefer living in a 3rd world village than what I'm living now.

Everytime I manage to find or work something good for me, the world takes it away from me. This isn&amp;#39;t just about the events of 2020 and how everyone has gotten hit hard. This is about my whole life. In the 17 years that I&amp;#39;ve been alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are Muslims, they were born in Morocco from extensive families with no money, my father brought them to Denmark, where me and my sister were born. They both worked hard from poverty to a normal and quiet life for all of us. I was the firstborn and my sister was born 1.5 years later. We lived in a nice and friendly town, my father worked in the capital that was a hour drive away (or so it felt like a hour drive, could had been 30 mins). I had a lot friends there and really good teachers, I did my homework in time with good results and I was a pretty normal kid, my best friend lived in the neighbourhood and we would always visit each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our normal yearly schedule was that my father worked all days except Monday and Tuesday, he was Co chief of the restaurant and kept it going when the owner wasn&amp;#39;t there. Every summer, we would go to Morocco where all of our families were coming aswell and come back before the next school year, we always slept at our grandparents home. Eventually, my parents saved and built a house in Morocco next to my grandparents of my mother&amp;#39;s side new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then shit hit the fan, I reached 4th grade I think at the age of 10 and my parents suddenly decided we were gonna move out. I later found out that my mother was depressed in Denmark and wanted to move out, she was a housewife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved to Málaga, Spain. I was forced to abandon to all my friends and I didn&amp;#39;t even have the strength to say I was moving, my teachers said that for me. I only managed to keep contact with one person, my best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was forced to learn a new language in a new cultural setting, the kids there were terrible, not even the clown of my class in Denmark could compare to them. I had not made a single decent friend ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2 years we lived in Málaga, we moved between two flats and changed two schools. My father still worked in Denmark, staying there for many months and coming to visit us for a few weeks. I had not made a single friend and I repeated a grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little explanation to Spains school system, there are 3 different grades for age groups, primary (x-12, ESO (13-16 meaning secondary) and bachelor (17-18). Primary had 6 years, secondary had 4 and bachelor had 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I moved, I kept contact with my best friend and we only played one thing together, Minecraft. I didn&amp;#39;t own Minecraft until I was 13, we always played in cracked servers together, almost everyday. That&amp;#39;s all I could do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved again, this time to Melilla, because it was so close to our home in Morocco. I only attended one year there in one apartment. I was 12 and attended 5th primary, I was supposed to attend 6th but my vocabulary skills could not keep up, halfway through the school year, the school placed me down to 4th primary just so I could manage, I was put with kids 2 years younger than me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we moved AGAIN. This time, to Barcelona... Or so we though, we spent a few weeks in Barcelona at my aunts home from my fathers side, my parents tried to look for a home and school that spoke castellano, because in the province of Barcelona, they spoke catalán. We never settled there and drove the roads of Spain again, we finally settled into the right city. Granada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should thank you for reading this far, because while this part will be the best, it&amp;#39;s also the worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first year in Granada was alright, I skipped 6th primary because of my age, I was put into 1st ESO with linguistic help. I found my strong points and weak points in the curriculum. I developed a disgust for Spanish literature and Geography History. We moved between two flats in the first year, I should also say that my contact with my friend has declined by ALOT. This was due to lack of Internet for many months and its removal many times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become 13 and my hormones and shit started, in my first year, I still didn&amp;#39;t make real friends but I made &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;. The bullying still continued though, but I started to stand up to myself and got branded a chivato (a snitch). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teenagers of Spain are by far the most toxic and insensible people I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. And they all get away with it. I started getting into fights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first year, I swapped school for my 2nd ESO, nothing changed and I was still surrounded by douchebags and fake friends. While still failing at the same subjects. But I made my first friend, a kid from Ecuador. I had never had such a good friend since Denmark, we played together Cod and visited each other. But nothing last forever I guess, instead of me being the one moving out, it was him. I stopped contacting him after 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3rd ESO, age 14. My mom placed me in the best school of the city and we had just finished renovations for our new flat that my parents had a loan to buy for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this school, its very building had the sense of freedom Denmark gave me, although not completely since its still got fences and shit, but still much more breathable. I passed my first few weeks there enjoying and meeting people, I thought I could make things different here. Guess not really. Did I fail to mention that my mom didn&amp;#39;t come with us from our last summer vacation? It was me, my sister and my father in the first few weeks of that schoolyear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father went to Morocco to talk things out with my mother, left me and my sister home alone for a few days with cash and food. I was 14, she was 12 and attended 1st ESO on my school. When my father came back, he packed our things one day after arriving and we went to Morocco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 terms in Spains schoolyear, one lasting 3 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were divorcing, and it was fucking messy. We spent the whole first term there, my parents put us in a private Moroccan school, we had to pay for fucking everything when Spain offered it for free. I was forced to attend a school system that had 3 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening, we rode a private cab every fucking day and there was even school in the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father became so fucking obsessed with keeping  everyone together, he had us involved. And it hurt my sister a lot. At the end of it all, my mom took us back to Granada, and my father lost his job trying to keep things together by the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed 3rd ESO, I got back to it by the 2nd term, never had the will to put effort after that shit of a divorce, but hey, I found my first friendgroup, a real friendgroup. I had found my love for anime and this friendgroup, although mostly consisted of girls, shared that love of anime and videogames. Particularly 3 friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these years, I had been so alone and gained no social interactions, I found it always hard to start convos and surprised how easily accepting they were of other new people and how they grew friendlier faster than what I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeated 3rd ESO along with 1 of those 3 friends. Turns out I found this one friend to be relatable, she had her parents divorce at the same year as mine, her mother was from Morocco and although she didn&amp;#39;t move around, she never had friends until 1st ESO where she met the other 2 friends. As the repeat year passed, I grew to like that girl but later understood that friendship is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life was hard after the divorce, the debts we owed the bank started pilling up and my father had financial trouble to help along, but I mother saw it as an excuse. She never brought us in, she was always defending herself, but now she became just as dumb as my father was. She revealed to my sister, that my father had married another woman and had a son, the woman died after birth and he left the firstborn in a orphanage, I was never the firstborn. She revealed this to my sister first, after that to me. I was confused, my sister started hating my dad. It would only be years after I realize, my mother is the one who truly caused the downfall of my sister. She never had a reason to reveal that. To this day, I haven&amp;#39;t talked about it with my dad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my profession, I wasnt fully sure but I wanted to do something with art, I started drawing since I moved to Melilla, it helped me cope and I had grown to become good, I was always the best one in class until I met that girl,whose art was much better than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed 3rd ESO and went into 4th ESO, I decided I wanted to do bachelor of arts and get into the art school of Granada. I made a lot more friends that year and learned more about them, I became more open but still had to deal with douchebags. I also learned that girl had a half brother just as old as my half brother, only difference being they live together with their common mother. I found the coincidence to be fascinating, as if the cosmos brought two people of the same background life together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and that girl both wanted to go to art school, we both applied and got denied. We had both given up hope, my mother didn&amp;#39;t though. She went to a place where all the school applications is handled and applied me there, after summer, me and my sister were sent to Granada alone, my mother would come two weeks after. She had told me to go check on my application, I didn&amp;#39;t want to because I knew J wouldn&amp;#39;t get accepted. I lied and she ended up going herself, they told us we would be contacted once the schoolyear started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time that me and my sister were homealone, my sister was prohibited from leaving alone or having friends over, I let her have some fun. Biggest mistake ever. The only reason I allowed her was because I had been sneaking my laptop out of my mother&amp;#39;s room every night before she went to sleep, so I could use it for some time when I was grounded from it, my sister knew that and took that as a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say this, at the end, my parents sold the flat and split the cash, my mom didn&amp;#39;t want to split the cash, she wanted 75% for &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;, my father knew better that she has become a money hogger. And took the 50% himself. My mother rented a new flat and my father bought me a new PC for my career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the schoolyear started, it was my first day of bachelor of socials. My friends were still in the same school, that girl came to class a bit late though. After I came home that day, my mother got a call in the evening, I was accepted into the school of arts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the schoolyear, we spent the morning doing paperwork and all that, day 3 I went to my school to get myself removed and say goodbye to my friends, I also found out the math teacher was a complete douchebags who thinks i should had informed him that I didn&amp;#39;t come to school at day 2. Glad I ain&amp;#39;t seeing him. I only regret not saying goodbye to that girl, I thought that it would only hurt her if she found out that I got in and she didn&amp;#39;t. Since she was the one who informed me about that school of arts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time at the school of arts was marvelous. You don&amp;#39;t get a better chance to make new friends when everyone doesn&amp;#39;t know each other. I made real friends I could trust and there was never a single douchebag ever. It was a paradise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit hit the fan again. Worse than anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister made a new habit, going to the library almost everyday. After a few days, I suspected something and told my mother, my mother spied on her somehow and grounded her. She wasn&amp;#39;t going to the library, she was hanging out with her &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only 2 weeks before a convention for weebs and gamers. Something me and my sister attended every year for the past 4 years in Granada. She was banned from going there and my sister got mad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day it happened, she ran away from home, after I came home and learned about what she did, we went to look for her. We came home with no luck and she didn&amp;#39;t even wait at the door. Next morning she came home and was grounded harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only a matter of time. One day I came home from school, we were waiting for my sister, she usually takes 5 min tops to come home after me. She didn&amp;#39;t come, I got a call from a classmate of my previous school where my sister is still attending. She found her in the nearby playground, drunk, without her sweater on. Ambulance took her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went there, my mother almost fucking fainted and cried her eyes out. I was fucking shocked, I already had bad relations and fought with her a lot but I never expected her to go bad bitch like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse of all, that school had 3 yearly meetings informing about dangers of alcohol, sex, and other shit to students. This has been taught 3x every year and she was always there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent in the hospital the entire evening, waiting for her to get sober. She had intoxicated herself with vodka. A boy came saying he was with her, he looked old but claimed to be the same age, I trusted him. I also looked old but was younger than people though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained what happened and she had drank vodka. He spoke with police and was let go. My mother knew he was lying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went home alone, barely managed to catch the last metro of the night. I sat on the couch and saw myself see that everything was a fucking lie to my sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister was allowed to go home, and they both came home. We didn&amp;#39;t ask her anything, we just let her rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the next day, she said she couldn&amp;#39;t remember anything, that it was all a blur. I had made contact with her friends and the school, she had been skipping school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions started and thus, our family was no more a family, she became violent, disrespectful, she didn&amp;#39;t want to speak, she attacked my mom and wanted to break my new laptop. We had police come to our home 3x to knock some sense to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She left her Instagram open and I found everything I needed to know, yet there was more. She had been sexting, talking drugs and when to get them, all that shit. And the one friend who we knew the most and that my mother trusted, knew about this and lied to my face about ever fucking knowing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought her to a government funded institution to help smokers better themselves. She didn&amp;#39;t want the treatment, thinking she is fine but we forced her. She was scheduled to get back next month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things calmed down, but not. She was expelled and spent the rest of the term in her home, my mom did not want to look for a school until she got some treatment, when she did get treatment, there was no school that could accept her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the first term. A new student joined my class. Turns out, the same method my mother used is the method the new kid used to get in, and it still works. I contacted that girl about it and she was excited to do it. 3 days later and she joined my class, I introduced her to my classmates and my friend group who we were already really good friends with and she fit in nicely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What felt like was hard to obtain friendship for me in those 3 years in the last ESO school, suddenly became so easy in the 3 months of the first term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grades were good, REALLY good. I had never gotten such good grades in Spanish before, I had the best Spanish teacher ever, using methods no other teacher ever used. I got a 8 when the highest I ever got was a 5. My low self esteem for the bachelor started boosting. I was confident in my studies for once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my real profession, video-game design, I started to learn programming, slowly but surely. I was waiting the most important date to truly start, 2020 new years resolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ran away, my sister, after being trapped in our house for many weeks and only allowed outside with my mom, took my keys and ran away. The door was always locked, we never trusted her. She did not come back home that night and we found her outside the next day, lying about throwing my keychain away. My mom had decided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wanted to move away, back to Melilla. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day after day, I tried to convince her not to, that she could get treatment and we will find a school &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even fucking told her that its OK if she repeats the year because I FUCKING REPEATED A YEAR AND IMPROVED MYSELF AS A PERSON. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t care, all she could see was a way out, where she didn&amp;#39;t had to deal with the law and could &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; my sister, but at what cost does my mom think she can save her daughter? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1st term was over, and my mom started packaging, we went from finally getting rid of that debt to my mom loaning 2k euros from her brothers to move between Granada and Morocco 6x with a fully loaded car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her first trip, it was new years eve, I still planned to follow through with my new year&amp;#39;s resolutions, after my mom left and it was just me and my sister alone, she took the opportunity, found my hidden key spot while I was sleeping and left. I spent new years eve alone, thus started 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I informed my mom immediately, for my resolutions I wanted to learn game development everyday and took personal hygiene properly, I even exercised everyday. This lasted only 3 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom came back quick, my sister returned home and went back to her room with nothing to say, I told my mother everything to do to check her, we found my keys in her sockets and tobacco in her bra. She isn&amp;#39;t just a manipulative liar anymore, she is also an expert of keeping secrets, luckily for my mom. Those years of having no friends have taught me how people act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom took another trip with the car loaded, this time I took better precautions, kept the key and cash with me at all times, when I slept, I would put it inside my pillow, in an unreachable place. Imagine my horror when I woke up at 8 Am, to my sister standing over my bed, I knew she was looking for the keys, I told her to get out and I went back to sleep. She came back inside my room asking for the TV cable, she was not allowed to watch TV without supervision. I told her to fuck off and go to sleep. I eventually gave in, she started making breakfast and told me to go take a bath cause I was stinking, it seemed liked a normal morning. I took my keys and cash into the bathroom and hid them in the cubicles, while I was taking a bath, she slowly creeped in and took the keys then races outside, I was forced to leave my bath and wear clothes quickly, she got away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt betrayed and violated, I didn&amp;#39;t want to do my resolutions, I reached depression once again. She eventually came back after a few days, I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her in but I had no choice. When my mom came back, she took her with her on the next trip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas vacation was almost over, every day alone in that stupid house felt like torture, I never knew living alone in a medium sized flat felt so exhausting, I never had the strength to write in my class WhatsApp that I was moving, not until the first day of the 2nd term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends sent me alot of messages saying how they will miss me, even the girl, I told her what happened cause she knew my sister and she was shocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very resolutions I planned to myself, the new me, was a failure immediatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7 years of moving out of Denmark all around Spain, after living in Granada for 5 years. I had finally regained my social abilities and found real friends in an environment of my own choosing that I&amp;#39;m happy with, only to have it all stripped away by the very same person who decided that we were gonna move 7 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the 2nd term was wasted in moving, I was stuck in Morocco with my mom wasting her time doing personal shit, she never even prioritised finding a new home in Melilla, our new flat ended up being a very small flat that my mom was paying slightly more than what we did in Granada. We managed to get WiFi in our home in Morocco, but in Melilla, we didn&amp;#39;t have any WiFi until the very day that Spain went into lockdown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the remaining 2nd term in depression, playing games during the weekdays and suffering with the WiFi in Morocco, which we are paying more for a speed of 12mbps when we had 300mbps for less price, with much better infrastructure and latency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online games that I played usually became nothing but sources of stress after the move due to the inferiority of the new WiFi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find friends in my new art school, but that place was worse than my last ESO school, the teachers barely cared and their system was drastically different, what became a understandable and slowly enjoyable Spanish subject for me now reverted back to the same disgust I had for it for the whole of ESO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;half of the class consisted of douchebags, and 99% of the class doesn&amp;#39;t even draw. Only 4 out of 40 can draw and only 3 do it with passion. Inclusing me. The rest are there because they think bachelor of arts is easier to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school itself was a joke, we were sharing classes with a ESO school, whose school building did not finish building and they were &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; to operate in the school of arts of melilla. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, what was the reason we came here? To help my sister recover, she didn&amp;#39;t. She stole a bottle of vodka and sold it to a homeless person, she also stored alcohol in her water bottle and hid it in her backpack. I told to my mom that day &amp;quot;I warned you, once you are in it, you never leave. My sister will not recover, she will not listen, and whenever she finds the chance again, she will do it again. We moved away from the best life opportunies for nothing&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of 2nd term, exams were coming. We already had the habit of going to Morocco on weekends, the border would take hours to pass through. One day, school ended on a Thursday, I had an exam on the evening. (Did I mention they do exams on the evening??? And their exams are supposed to last 2 hours unlike the usual 1 hour? And every Tuesday, class starts one hour earlier but still ends the same time?) my mom didn&amp;#39;t want to wait, I wanted to do the exam. She told me I could cross the border on foot and wait for the WiFi technicians to come. I accepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She forgot to leave the passport to me. She took my laptop, the WiFi got installed and I did my exam. After packing up and sending a msg to my mom that I&amp;#39;m coming. I went out and locked the door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived to the border on foot, turns out, there was a lot of people than normally. Little did I know, the president just announced that Spain is going on lockdown and that Morocco is closing the border on Friday. Had I chosen to stay the night, I would had been stuck in Melilla with no cash to live on and no way to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moroccan side of the border stopped me, they normally never ask for passport since anyone who does enter Morocco is definitely moroccan but they did for me. I didn&amp;#39;t have it and they brought me to the office, after some talking, a guard offered me Internet to call my mom. She came and picked me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lockdown happened and online school began. I had to wake up 1 hour earlier just to be able to attend it. It was hellish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already depressed as shit, knowing I barely escaped the border and being stuck in melilla, I knew it was gonna happen eventually but I didn&amp;#39;t expect it like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online school was a fucking mess, the 2nd term was over and I failed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the 3rd term started, timezones had changed and now I had to wake up 2 hours earlier, I was done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any class that was too early, I gave up on. I tried attending any I could, but I would always overslept and miss most classes, before I know it, I had missed so many assignments and classes, chances of me succeeding the year was impossible. I gave up, never attended or responded for the rest of the term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fucking night, I would lay awake wondering how the fuck did I get here. How did my dad abandon my half brother and if I should seek him out. How my mother came to the conclusion that her easily resolvable mental health was more important than our growth as kids. How my parents act more children than adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I ever get out of this mess? Is my dream even still possible? Will I ever get to see my friends again? 
Will I see her, the girl who helped me cope after my parents divorced and I helped her have a chance in her dreams? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom says everything she does is for us, she has given all her house cut (50k euros) to my dad for his new restaurant in Netherlands. Money that could had been used to never make another loan, money that could had paid my college expenses (2k euros).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in debt, my mom has had the audacity to buy a 4k TV, to make small renovations and constructions in our house in Morocco. Even a modern day US college student wouldn&amp;#39;t do this if he had the cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just hurts so much, and everytime I try to open up to my mom about this, she makes this about herself, that she risked it all for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says she will never go back to Granada, and my only chance of getting back would be if I pass 1st bachelor and she would rent a student apartment, something expensive and that I cannot do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about people&amp;#39;s life stories, their ups and downs, and how they always get their good ending. I don&amp;#39;t see a good ending, I see myself having been born with all the opportunities and being dragged down to a land where labor pays worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, if I ever will get the motivation to restart my learning in game development, I have ideas, great ideas but I just can&amp;#39;t manage to stop depressing myself, I&amp;#39;m afraid that this cycle will repeat and that nothing will matter because my life is the same cycle of &amp;quot;give me something good, give me something even worse&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to die, I just want to be happy. I would prefer living in a 3rd world village than what I&amp;#39;m living now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading all this.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m 17 and have been trying to apply to scholarships starting this summer and they all make me realize how horribly average i am, academically. Every time i look at scholarships or study for my upcoming ACT, i get so discouraged and feel the urge to give into old habits because of the stress and the idea that i never improve. I’m fucking tired of the voice inside my head telling me i should just commit now before shit gets harder u know? I don’t want to commit but i hate being depressed.

All of my peers around me seem to be enjoying their lives on social media, probably no fucks given about college since their wealthy parents are paying for their education. That’s one of the reasons i deleted social media because it’s just another way for me to compare my lonely ass life to everyone else with friends and stuff. 

The only thing keeping me from suicide is my younger siblings. I don’t want them to grow up with that pain of having an older sister who killed herself. I also can’t leave my mom who depends on my help. I just don’t want to fucking be here i wish i could just disappear. 

Sometimes things feel hopeful when i listen to music and ride my dad’s bike. I wish i could listen to music and ride my dad’s bike for eternity.

Also FYI not saying that stress from academics is the only thing that makes me suicidal or depressed. There’s so much more i could talk about but thats just the main thing currently that has made me feel discouraged especially when no one talks about it and preparing for college is depicted as some inspirational eye opening bonding thing. 

I also don’t mean to come across as another American kid who undervalues the importance of education. I come from a family of immigrants who have worked hard for everything.

If you do this thing, you won't have to suffer anymore, life will have meaning  and you won't ever feel this way again. I tell myself over and over.

On paper it has worked out great! I moved out on my own a few years ago, a prestigious education with a bright career ahead of me! I started lifting as well and after several years of strict programming and diet my physical health is better than ever- as a result of self punishment for my self percieved laziness. I still hate my body but now instead for what it symbolizes rather than for what it looks like. I have physically manifested the fake persona that I live every day, every time I interact with anyone. This perpetual hamster wheel that I am seemingly unable to escape.
I have only been motivated out of fear and self loathing and I don't think I will ever be able to break loose.

I just told them so that you would spend more time on me, my opinions weren't genuine, they were twisted to become pallatable versions of my thoughts.

I shouldn't be surprised that it didn't last and I miss her a lot but I can sincerely say that I think she is better off not having me in her life.

I’ve been pretty delicate emotionally and scrolling through any of my social feeds I catch myself IMMEDIATELY dissociating. My family is not a support system, my “friends” are not close ones, and my coworkers are not potential friends or confidants in really anything. 

Plus due to all the *event* I’ve undergone a great deal of stress, from losing my job, having to move out of my house (thankfully I had enough to finish my lease), amassing 3times the debt I’m comfortable having, and I’m about to go on my cycle. So a lot of negative stress. 

I’ve been trying to be positive: losing my job gave me time to volunteer, losing my house means less expense in the future, I’m studious enough to pay off my debt...

But it has been a struggle, and I’m desperate for social interaction that isn’t about the *event*. 

I was able to go back to work on Wednesday, but a new rule is that we can’t work without masks.

1)the masks I ordered haven’t arrived yet, 
2) I can’t purchase any temporary ones due to the debts I have to pay 
3) I’m worried with how fast paced my job is I’ll hyperventilate with a mask on and faint (which would be very dangerous)

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to just be defective? To just not be suitable to exist in this world? To be not enough. I always feel like I&amp;#39;m not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

I just turned 17, I have 7 ppl in my fam including me, I’m mixed, I live w 2 siblings and parents, I dropped out of school at 16 due to depression and anxiety even tho I’d be considered ‘bright’, I have a few close friends and some other ‘friends’ that I wouldn’t rly hang out w v often unless in a group cuz I’m too anxious to see them even tho they’re my friends. I would mainly have 3 close friends :/ I’ve had anxiety since I was 4 and always hated being around people and always wanted to be alone and always thought I was alone. I’ve had depression since I was 13 even tho before that I used to think ppl with depression were ‘weak’, lol fuckinf karma lmao and have wanted to kms numerous times lol. I’m now 17 as of a few days ago and so far the drugs I’ve abused are weed, hash, codeine, dxm, Valium, alcohol, lsd, lsa and others I can’t remember Nd probs gona do more. I do drugs bc I love the euphoria and it helps me not be depressed and I always hope the feeling will last forever. But even tho I haven’t done many, even now they just don’t seem to cut it anymore, the euphorias gone, And I’m just.. high.

None of my family know I feel like shit (I’m on anti depressants) atm bc I put on a happy face. I can’t talk to anyone bc my brain literally won’t fkn let me. I’ve been to several therapists and w some of them I literally sit in silence bc I cant get anything out. Idk why tf I’m writing this I guess I just wana vent, at some point I literally just wana do fkn heroin or something bc I know its supposed to feel like ur fkn floating and u feel amazing and I don’t care if it kills me bc I’m sick of feeling nothing.

,depression,"
- I’ve been thinking about us so much the past month. I’ve been also suppressing emotions and looking the other way when it comes to our mental stability and how toxic this is becoming because i wanted to be with you. I want my bestfriend. I want my girlfriend. And i kept teetering between both of those much lately. As much as i love and need my bestfriend, i still can’t see my life progressing without my girlfriend. You’ve been in my life for so long. I can’t lose you. You’re irreplaceable. I know this must hurt you too. Break ups bring up the worst in everyone. The ugly sad hopeless side of every person. It’s sometimes portrayed as hatred towards the former partner. Sometimes it’s portrayed as a competition between both partners and who’ll end up feeling better or I don’t fucking know and i hate these kind of people. Sometimes seeking revenge or trying to inflict pain. When i think about it, i feel disgusted. I see it as the equivalent of stabbing someone. The motive is similar; wanting to inflict pain, seeking revenge, hatred, abuse and such. Verbal abuse might not show on the victim unlike physical abuse. They’re so different and i surely can’t compare one to the other, but verbal abuse is just a road to physical one. I guess what i’m trying to say is that i know your motive isn’t bad nor mine. But the ugly part of me that comes after break ups isn’t something you’ll like. The ugly side of you that comes after break ups, I’m not ready to see. The problem with your ugly side is that people think it lasts for a month or something then you pluck up the energy and get right back on track. I know it’s hard for you and I know how tough it is. I know you hate being grumpy. I know you don’t like yourself when you’re sad so you go back to your comfy place and that place is a positive loving caring extrovert. That’s hard. I know it’s not that simple. I know it takes a lot of energy and it drains you till you actually find something. That somethings grows and you start to like it and like your life a little because you found something you want to grow; your love for that something. You start feeling better and sometimes that’s it. You’re okay. But one thing i found in common between all the times you were okay and not forcing positivity, is that you get rid of the remains of your relationship. You never want to destroy the relationship and you always want an amicable exit. And that’s it. An exit. That’s when you get better but i’m not gonna come here and convince you that this is about how i know what’s the best for you. I’m just saying this is my observation and i also wanted to say that this isn’t what i wanted to say. I’m trying to say is that i can’t stand that ugly side of yours because it’s also so nice to see from the outside. If I didn’t know you I would’ve thought you’re doing better. You’re doing okay and you’re happy. You are radiant. When you want positivity, you naturally radiate positivity. My ugly side is jealousy and obsessiveness. I never got jealous because my argument was i have you. You’re my girlfriend. Now i have nothing. And it builds up. And it burns me from the inside. I take a negative approach bas with a good outcome. I distract myself with work and important stuff. I eliminate my social life. I go to my own shell. I deal with my own problems. Then after a while, after getting better, i start looking for someone who’s still willing to be my friend. I tell him/her what happened and i slowly build up my social life again just to crash it later on. I’m not a positive person. I like to be happy. I would love for that to happen but i won’t do anything to be happy at the time i’m getting over someone or generally depressed. So in this time, I’ll just he obsessing over you, from close distance which will drive you crazy and later on cause a whole lot of heat between us which leads to me deeply hurting you even more and even furthering you more from the idea of us if i wanna be that guy. You know how cheesy i am so you get me right?
- I can’t stand hurting you anymore. You’re the most important person in my entire life. You’re my lovely sweet bestfriend. You’re my whole world literally and it’s not worth trying if you’re not there to cheer for me and pat my back. You’re so supportive. I just can’t make you cry by my mistakes anymore. At least when you cry that i’m not there anymore is better than crying because i’m such a stupid asshole dick. Right? At least you won’t hate me right?
=Are you cutting me off?
- No. Yes. I dont know. We’ll see. I just can’t stand feeling this way and i’m feeling this way because i’m starting to feel jealous which trust me is the beginning of half of our fights. It all starts here and builds up and goes off and you end up not being able to talk just because it got so complicated. It all starts here. This is the point where you’ll try to reach two months from now but you won’t find the words. It’ll be because i got jealous and obsessive just because i got overwhelmed by the fact that you’re not my girlfriend and life will move on. I tried going on fb today for the first time. I found you tagging me a couple of times and a couple of old reacts. I swear to god it took a minute to get triggered by something so bad I deactivated facebook. This is the kind of things i do and is okay but not in this situation because we’re bestfriends. We’re talking and we’re hanging out. It’s either i delete you or my social media and obviously it was an easy choice. But that’s what’s this whole conversation is about. I turned my head away and suppressed my anxiety and feelings in general. I looked away. That’s what i do best. I hid. This is the toxicity i’m talking about and I’m sure on your end there’s similar things that happen. But to be fair, i’m on the wrong. I convinced myself that i was right and i am right if we werent still bestfriends. I convinced myself that this is what i have to do for the sake of our friendship. We’re killing each other. By the time we save the friendship we will no longer be. I really need this friendship ya rana and i’m willing to deal with my own emotions and not torture you with these details but it will yield a spark that ignites a fire between us and it’s not the nice kind of fire. We’ve been burning for months and all we did was throw gas at ourselves. We were burning and we had the tanks and surely we won’t burn each other so we spill it on ourselves. While standing close to each other. Thus, creating a bigger flame. Im fucking using big words up in this bitch that’s how you know i care. I’m doing metaphors and idioms. Where is my fucking idk nobel ? I hate hurting you. I hate not being around you and you know it’s better for me to stay close.
- I mean first of all you are literally my world. I didn’t feel the need to login anything since we talked but i just wanted to find nice memes to tag you. The past couple of weeks where the worst weeks of my life and i compare them to that depressive episode back in sophomore. And that year i lost a lot. I mean it. But this two weeks felt heavier than losing my mom to a stranger. My car and self esteem to an accident. My friends. Even my grandma. And that time was horrible too because there was unresolved issues between us not because all the drama. You’re my entire world and i always knew it and i always denied it because i was fucking scared. I was fucking scared that we’ll come to a day where you can’t be my world anymore. I always knew it and when i say i denied it i dont mean that i said you weren’t nor acted as if you weren’t. You’re never in the same place. You move around alot and you have a lot of friends and connections everywhere. You are genuine and caring towards all of them and you put me first im not gonna deny that. I’m going to be 100% honest. I dont want to be competing with someone else. I dont want to share my place with anyone else. I’ll still be your bestfriend. And you have mariam you know? I want to feel special. Don’t get me wrong, you make me feel special but i wanted another kind of special. I swear to god i always did and that was the issues i had to deal with before we got together. I build barriers so i wont let myself fall for the fact that you’re my world. Because as big and huge i am to you, it always feel like i’m sharing with someone. I might have the biggest share, but when someone new came along, (as new friends i’m still talking about before we got togther), you get distracted for a little bit. I miss when i was the guy you told your friends sbout. I miss you taking me out with your friends and the whole “meen seif da” phase. I felt so special bas now i feel like it aint anymore but it’s just s constant that you cant let go because i’ve aleays been there. I see nothing special now about me which makes me obssesed and jealous that’s why i build barriers. That’s why i invented aw got so attached to “da seif”. It was an argument we used to used and i build a home and a comfort zone henak. Delwa2ty hatta “da seif”, we lost the rights to it. All the times i felt like there’s an issue i had with you were always the times where there was someone new, new friends, new people. All of the times were just because i got jealous and mad. I knew all along that you were special and i was special to you. But i always want my own place. So being just your bestfriend is someplace i was 5 years ago. When we were texting after finals. Im so sorry but I can’t go back to not being comfortable around you. I can’t care now about how you see me because i’m in a shitty place already. I can’t be your bestfriend. And i cant what we used to be before getting together. You’re my sister but i cant see you like that anymore. And even if somehow we did see each other again as a family, i dont think anyone would accept that which is the second reason why it’s better for me to stay close. I can scare anyone off by just being there. Which will have negative effect on me too and will put you in a difficult position. And i can dwell over you as much as i want. I dont mind just seeing you grow and seeing you happy. I’ve been watching you grow for the past 6 months and my god nothing brought me much joy. Nothing on earth brought me joy as much as seeing you grow and be better and lately maybe you hit a rough patch on some aspects but in other aspects you’re doing fucking amazing. Progress isn’t just not linear. Progress isn’t just one aspect. You might seem like you’re failing in something but generally you’re doing fantastic. I can’t be around you without eventually hurting you. I cant be around you without getting hurt. And i’m sorry if i seem inconsiderate. It’s not that I don’t see how much youMre already suffering and i know your life doesnt revolve around me and there is so much other shit that goes in your head. I know this is coming off as one sided. It is. This is me telling you i dont want to be a bad person. I dont want to be hated. It’s all about me. Im self-centered. I even say that to make everything revolve around me. And that’s my biggest flaw. I try to put myself in the other’s shoes but i dont really. You’re an amazing girl. And i love you. I cant find anyway out of this. I cant be with nor without you. My life is horrible khlas.

,depression,"I’ve tried writing this about a hundred times. Every time I begin writing, I end up deleting the post because what’s the point of writing this? Nothing’s ever gonna change. 

I guess I’m writing this now just to finally get it all off my chest. If I’m being honest, I don’t think I have a lot left in me, but hey maybe someone here will be able to help. 

I first realized I had depression in 7th grade. I realized that it wasn’t normal to always be sad; and it definitely wasn’t normal to have constant thoughts of killing myself. Fast forward 7 years and I’m still having these thoughts every single day. It’s easy to say now that I should’ve tried to get help in the last 7 years but the truth is I don’t know who I would talk. I have a terrible relationship with my family (I think the fact that they’ve never noticed that i’ve been depressed these last 7 years is indicative of that), I don’t have any friends that I’m close to, and I don’t have money for therapy. I’ve only ever told one person and that ended up making my depression 100x worse but that’s a story for another day. 

Life went on and I learned to live with it. It didn’t really affect my life, and I was great at hiding it. During the day I would be the happy guy that always had a smile on his face, but every night i’d be crying myself to sleep. That’s pretty much how all of high school went. 

Anyways this last year I felt like my depression was progressively getting worse. I began losing hope that I was ever gonna get better. And then, in a desperate attempt to put some hope into my heart, I decided to fall in love with a girl. And not just any girl, my closest friend. I fell super hard and put all my hope that everything was gonna be okay some day into her. I guess my depressed mind mistook every signal that was there and thought she liked me back so I decided to be honest with her and told her about how I felt. Not only did my plan backfire and she said she didn’t like me back, she also said it would be best if we took a break from talking. 


So yeah that was a week ago and now I have nothing left. I have no friends and no one to talk to. My depression is at an all time high. I literally can’t function anymore. I wrote a rough draft of a suicide note, planning on finishing that up later. So yeah that’s where i’m at right now. No more hope. 

I would just end it all right now but I’m too pussy to do that cuz “I don’t want to burden my family” and blah blah blah. I really don’t know what to do anymore, i’ve never been this low.

I have a terrible relationship with my family (I think the fact that they’ve never noticed that i’ve been depressed these last 7 years is indicative of that), I don’t have any friends that I’m close to, and I don’t have money for therapy. I’ve only ever told one person and that ended up making my depression 100x worse but that’s a story for another day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life went on and I learned to live with it. It didn’t really affect my life, and I was great at hiding it. During the day I would be the happy guy that always had a smile on his face, but every night i’d be crying myself to sleep. That’s pretty much how all of high school went. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways this last year I felt like my depression was progressively getting worse. I began losing hope that I was ever gonna get better. And then, in a desperate attempt to put some hope into my heart, I decided to fall in love with a girl. And not just any girl, my closest friend. I fell super hard and put all my hope that everything was gonna be okay some day into her. I guess my depressed mind mistook every signal that was there and thought she liked me back so I decided to be honest with her and told her about how I felt. Not only did my plan backfire and she said she didn’t like me back, she also said it would be best if we took a break from talking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah that was a week ago and now I have nothing left. I have no friends and no one to talk to. My depression is at an all time high. I literally can’t function anymore. I wrote a rough draft of a suicide note, planning on finishing that up later. So yeah that’s where i’m at right now. No more hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would just end it all right now but I’m too pussy to do that cuz “I don’t want to burden my family” and blah blah blah. I really don’t know what to do anymore, i’ve never been this low. I’ve given up already but now what.&lt;/p&gt;

My life was pretty bad: abused and beaten when I was a kid, which led to me not sleeping and going to school, which led to me getting bullied and getting bad grades, which led to me getting abused and beaten again. 

I had gotten over it all... at least thats what I thought. After my mother (the one who abused and beat me the most) died, I started having issues again. 

Those issues destroyed my motivation to keep going with my life and made me kill the relationship I had with my girlfriend. To make it worse, my grandmother (the one who took care of me for years) had a stroke, a heart attack and underwent surgery all in the same week. 

I have been sleeping constantly for weeks now. I wake up to eat some leftovers, go to the bathroom and lie down again. 

I stopped talking to everyone that I know, not that it makes any difference, as they didn't even notice I was gone. My birthday came, only got a few messages from random people. 

My entire life has stopped, but I dont have any motivation left to keep going. I feel worthless.

,depression,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this.I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls.

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours last night). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

I just, don't think I want to live anymore. Everyday I'm depressed, everyday I feel like I burden people with who I am.

i wake up to anxiety attacks and being so anxious that i become nauseous. like today i woke up and felt so much anxiety and a weight on my chest i went back to sleep but every time i woke up it was still there and had me nauseous. i haven’t eaten for two days now but there i was throwing up for about half an hour. 
my body, mind and soul are just so exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry if my writing is all over the place my mind just isn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve lived alone for about a year, had roommates or lived with someone from 16-28, and it’s been extremely hard to live with myself.

,depression,"And in its depths, I found myself again.

Caught in an ever entangling web. The momentary glimmer of hope seemed to grow more and more distant with time. Was any of this real? I often asked myself. Still banging my head against a wall.

A few moments of peace is all that I had desired. Though, despite casting several illusions of growth, stasis seemed inevitable.
There was always something expected of me. And these expectations only grew.

So much so, that soon I started expecting things from myself. I fought hard to convince myself that I could live upto these expectations. But is living worth it? Even if I fulfill these, the next set will already be knocking on my door. Where do I stop then? When do I stop? Is there even a halt?

I wish I were strong. As strong as everyone around me. But the truth is, I am not. I get scared easily. I try to hide my weaknesses by helping others overcome their's. In the hope that someday, I'll gather the strength to overcome mine. But that doesn't seem right lately. A new problem, somehow always finds it way to me.

I am tired of pretending. I just want to be happy again. Be passionate again. I don't want to be caught up with worldly struggles. Sometimes, I don't even feel like existing. But I know a lot of people care for me. And I don't want to see them hurt. But I don't want to hurt myself either. I wonder if the world would be better if I didn't exist.

Everytime I see people mourning suicides, questioning the motivations of the doer, telling them that it wasn't an act of strength, I flinch. What do you know? It takes immense courage to decide to let go of yourself. Even more than living. When the uncertainty in life increases beyond the uncertainty in death, the act of letting go serves as one last attempt at grasping for hope. In believing in the beyond.

Even for someone as expressive as me, sharing what I feel is difficult. Even with the people who care the most about me. What will it achieve? Can I even be helped? I have ambitions too, I want to live too, I have tried to actively change too. Just because my efforts aren't visible doesn't mean that they don't exist. I try. I have tried. I am just tired now. Tired of always smiling when I am in pain.

&lt;p&gt;Caught in an ever entangling web. The momentary glimmer of hope seemed to grow more and more distant with time. Was any of this real? I often asked myself. Still banging my head against a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments of peace is all that I had desired. Though, despite casting several illusions of growth, stasis seemed inevitable.
There was always something expected of me. And these expectations only grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much so, that soon I started expecting things from myself. I fought hard to convince myself that I could live upto these expectations. But is living worth it? Even if I fulfill these, the next set will already be knocking on my door. Where do I stop then? When do I stop? Is there even a halt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I were strong. As strong as everyone around me. But the truth is, I am not. I get scared easily. I try to hide my weaknesses by helping others overcome their&amp;#39;s. In the hope that someday, I&amp;#39;ll gather the strength to overcome mine. But that doesn&amp;#39;t seem right lately. A new problem, somehow always finds it way to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of pretending. I just want to be happy again. Be passionate again. I don&amp;#39;t want to be caught up with worldly struggles. Sometimes, I don&amp;#39;t even feel like existing. But I know a lot of people care for me. And I don&amp;#39;t want to see them hurt. But I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt myself either. I wonder if the world would be better if I didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short, I (21F) had a decent childhood. Lots of good times, but my parents had a shit marriage and I never really got along consistently with my dad.

,depression,"I'm sorry that this is so long. I have not talked to a therapist in years and I am too afraid if being a burden to my friend's by reaching out to them. I have a lot on my chest.

I just want to say first of all I didn't have the worst relationship with him. But it was not good either. Whenever I have late night conversations with my brother and we end up talking about him it usually ends with us concluding that he was abusive, but he meant well. And as far as shit fathers go we fared pretty well considering how much worse we could have had it. 
My father's passing definitely affected me way more than my brother. I was 14 and the older one and I had way more memories of him. He was also a lot harder on me than he was with him. He never hit me over ""nothing""but he would always freak out over the mildest things. He once chased me with a knife and slapped my ass with the honing rod for sharpening knives and dragged me to my room. My crime was asking too many questions while he was cooking and just being mildly annoying. He later apologized to me but he made me apologize back to him and promise to not be annoying ever again. I was 7. Kids are just naturally stupid and annoying

I thought that the reason he was a hard ass was because he was an immigrant from Mexico who had it rough living in a really poor area and that trauma stuck with him. And it didn't help that he was an older father who unexpectedly had me at 50 and was too set in his ways to accommodate a kid. But I realized it didn't matter if he grew up rich and had me at 27. His problem was that he was never emotionally mature and he was not going to suddenly have it when he was old enough for the senior menu at Denny's. 

The realization that my dad probably wasn't doing the best with what he had came only in the past few years. I hang out in a diverse crowd but over half of my close friends are Latino. We kind of like to play games where we see whose parents were the worst because usually Latino parents are angry. I realized he wasn't a normal Mexican father when my friends stared at me in silence and wide eyed and told me that he was crazy. What set that off was telling them that my dad would compare me negatively to other kids and would tell me that the kids at school were talking bout how unimpressed they were with me behind my back. The other thing was that he would make me stare at myself in the mirror because I had chapped lips and told me that I was a shame for it. 

Me and my brother didn't live up to his standards. He wanted us to be the best in class and told us that when we grow up the only thing that mattered was that we went to college and made at a minimum $100,000. He would hit me the most whenever I did homework with him. He would make everything a lot harder and I was scared of setting him off. Usually after a long night of him getting upset with me and making me cry he would apologize to and give me a shoulder massage when I didn't want him anywhere near me. And he would still expect me to boost his ego by asking me to compliment his ""teaching.""

Summers were also bad. Instead of hanging out with friends I was indoors doing ""homework"" assignments that he made up that were redundant and taught me nothing. And when he looked over my shoulders it was like walking on egg shells like with REAL school work. He especially lost his shit over a kids word search packet. I was not solving it fast enough for his standards so he got really upset and started screaming at me and hitting me. I literally thought about asking him for permission to be a kid during summer break. Also he never placed this amount of pressure on my brother.
I know it is a cliche to blame your parents for how you turned out but I feel like I can definitely blame him. My self-esteem is non-existent. I'm almost 30 and I never dated anyone seriously. It's not a fear of commitment or anything. I still don't think I'm worthy of being loved. And deep down I am scared that I will be a shitty significant other like my dad was. He never hit my mom but he did speak down to her and he held her back because he never had a consistent job and was mostly useless. I'm worried that I will be the same way. 
I still want to be a dad and a husband eventually. But to be a better one than my dad I have to be comfortable with myself. I can blame my dad for destroying my self-worth but I have to take responsibility for never trying to do better.

And it didn&amp;#39;t help that he was an older father who unexpectedly had me at 50 and was too set in his ways to accommodate a kid. But I realized it didn&amp;#39;t matter if he grew up rich and had me at 27. His problem was that he was never emotionally mature and he was not going to suddenly have it when he was old enough for the senior menu at Denny&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that my dad probably wasn&amp;#39;t doing the best with what he had came only in the past few years. I hang out in a diverse crowd but over half of my close friends are Latino. We kind of like to play games where we see whose parents were the worst because usually Latino parents are angry. I realized he wasn&amp;#39;t a normal Mexican father when my friends stared at me in silence and wide eyed and told me that he was crazy. What set that off was telling them that my dad would compare me negatively to other kids and would tell me that the kids at school were talking bout how unimpressed they were with me behind my back. The other thing was that he would make me stare at myself in the mirror because I had chapped lips and told me that I was a shame for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my brother didn&amp;#39;t live up to his standards. He wanted us to be the best in class and told us that when we grow up the only thing that mattered was that we went to college and made at a minimum $100,000. He would hit me the most whenever I did homework with him. He would make everything a lot harder and I was scared of setting him off. Usually after a long night of him getting upset with me and making me cry he would apologize to and give me a shoulder massage when I didn&amp;#39;t want him anywhere near me. And he would still expect me to boost his ego by asking me to compliment his &amp;quot;teaching.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summers were also bad. Instead of hanging out with friends I was indoors doing &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; assignments that he made up that were redundant and taught me nothing. And when he looked over my shoulders it was like walking on egg shells like with REAL school work. He especially lost his shit over a kids word search packet. I was not solving it fast enough for his standards so he got really upset and started screaming at me and hitting me. I literally thought about asking him for permission to be a kid during summer break. Also he never placed this amount of pressure on my brother.
I know it is a cliche to blame your parents for how you turned out but I feel like I can definitely blame him. My self-esteem is non-existent. I&amp;#39;m almost 30 and I never dated anyone seriously. It&amp;#39;s not a fear of commitment or anything. I still don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m worthy of being loved. And deep down I am scared that I will be a shitty significant other like my dad was. He never hit my mom but he did speak down to her and he held her back because he never had a consistent job and was mostly useless. I&amp;#39;m worried that I will be the same way. 
I still want to be a dad and a husband eventually. But to be a better one than my dad I have to be comfortable with myself. I can blame my dad for destroying my self-worth but I have to take responsibility for never trying to do better. I&amp;#39;m not ever going to forgive him but I am ready to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"First time ever writing, I know there’s a lot wrong with it

From a young age, women, men and the whole society are branded into a certain group of people. There’s the popular, the anti-social, the gamers, the geeks, the list goes on. I often think people don’t mean to do this but come on the whole concept of life scares people, so they think fitting into a group of people is easier then fitting into the world but do they really fit in…? 
I think they want to believe they do, the world needs to realise the pureness of each individual and realise the crushing pressure we put on young individuals to fit in. Forcing a girl to fit in to the popular group so she mask her feeling and covers her face to live in a life that isn’t her, we force the boys to learn all the football terms and all the latest game so there in the cool groups and so they try to mask the fact they don’t like who they are anymore.
The story is closer to my heart then I like to think, Girls are always told from a young age weather from the bullies or my inter demons that they don’t belong, THEY WONT BELONG, WE WONT BELONG.
the fact that a young girl from around nine years old has to now start watching over her shoulder sat at the school dinner table in case the school bullies are coming over, but what will she get called today, freak, nerd.
No not that today, that the girl could handle, she’s used to that, it feels like that vocabulary is normally, it’s just everyday life. But no, today wasn’t like the rest of them, the school bullies walked straight past without a word, without a stare, the little innocent girl was relieved but didn’t show it, just so the bully’s wouldn’t notice and circle back around like angry vultures. The girl almost felt bad that maybe they have found someone else. But that’s the lesson the world teaches us from such a young age is that we look out for our selfs.
The little girl was silly to think it was over, three o’clock strikes and the bullies are stood out the school gate, this was the magic age when a young girl gains the independence to walk home by herself, however this little girl was no long glad of this independence, she felt unsafe.
The girls, the bullies, the vultures whatever you want to call them, followed the innocent girl home, shouting horrendous names at her; chubby, ugly, weirdo, freak the list went on but when the names turned into action, then she got scared. 
She learn to run as fast as she could that week, she needed to be home where she was safe. The young girl had to learn to put a brave face on and wait until the door was closed to break the wall down and let out the tears. 
Two weeks went by and nothing had changed over than the young girl changing her emotions, she was no longer scared but no, not of the bullies, she was no longer scared of dying.
That day the vultures got braver that normally and waited outside the young girls house, she didn’t know where to go, what to do, her safe place was gone. They stood verbally abusing her until she broke down the the floor, that’s when a spying eye from across the road saw and spooked them, the girl didn’t have a clue who all she knew was she was grateful.
Later that night the young girl broke down on her mother’s lap after visiting grandparents because she couldn’t handle the pain of being locked with a demon in her own head. This was no normal day, it was way from it, this was the day she was sexual assault by her own grandfather.
The young girl didn’t feel innocent or pure anymore, a tiny nine year old girl didn’t  feel she had a life left to live anymore, she begged her mother to make the pain and the heart ache go away, she was too afraid to tell her mother about the grandfather so she simple said she didn’t want to go for a while so she didn’t upset them with how she was feeling. Her mother did anything and everything a mother of a child could do, we spent endless weeks confronting the parents, the teacher but it was no use, that’s because the girls was branded as popular, popular girl tend to have the motto, we were just having fun and even better there parents motto was girls will be girls. 
So after months of fighting and failing the little girl was home schooled, the most important years of primary and she missed it, the trips, the prom, the friends. The girl didn’t care about this she had too much going off at home, a young nine year old girl had too much going on how can that be right, how can that be a possibility in the world we live in, when did this world become a place I don’t want to be in.
The girl sooner after becoming homeschooled had to go through seeing her grandparents again where the same tragic events kept having over and over for months. 

Fast forward a couple of months and nothing has changed other than the girl has to cry herself to sleep, not knowing any other way to cope or any other way to deal with the pain or the past. But this was no ordinary night, this was the night before she goes to high school, the new start for her, all this girl can think about is weather she’s branded the freak for life.
So the morning comes and she didn’t know what to think, but her mother was excited so she had to be, she didn’t want to cause anymore pain or heartbreak to anyone. She walks into the overwhelming hall and everyone the same, young, scared, nervous and in that one moment she’s not scared or overthinking, this was a fresh start for her to move on.
The young girl thrived, she meant friends, real friends, not like the ones that stabbed her in the back, the real kind she couldn’t believe she was capable of it. 
That next two years went so quick building so many memory’s with amazing people, there was just one person in her life that was not so amazing or pure, her grandfather. Even though she managed to get out of endless visits due to homework or after school clubs, she was forced to go this time as it’s been to long without seeming them. The girl was forced into a shed in the corner of her granny’s house and abuse physical and emotional. After an hour there’s an knock at the door saying home time. The tears of relief roll down her face. The girl couldn’t handle the feeling of being used or scared or broken anymore. So she does the only thing she knows how to and goes hope to her safe space and cry’s, this time was different she had a best friend who she trusted to talk to and to calm her down.
The next day the young girl got called out of lesson to the guidance counsellor. When they muttered the worlds “tell us about your grandfather”. She couldn’t believe this moment had come she was let out of the cage, she was angry for her friend speaking out but always relieved it was over. Later that night the young girl had to speak to her family and authority about everyone, the authorities didn’t believe her as her grandfather had a way with words, but her family did, even in the darkest moment of her life they stood by her.
From that day she and her family never spoke to what She calls her past again, she thought it was over that it would all be better but it wasn’t she was left with the demons in the head, he came with a roller coaster of emotions and panic attacks.
The girl learn to mask her feeling and buried them deep down where no one could see, instead of bullies, she battled the worse enemy ever...herself. 
What the girl didn’t remember was she was not alone no matter how alone she felt, a couple of weeks later the girl was found killer in an abandoned bullied she had been raped and murder, she went to that building because that was the only thing she knew that was the only thing she felt like she was useful for, that she was needed for, she couldn’t handle the feeling of being ashamed anymore, she was now at peace maybe not with her self but with her demon inside. 
The true realisation is that if we didn’t have the type or groups of people we wouldn’t feel like we need to change our selfies, we wouldn’t be afraid to stand up for our self’s, we wouldn’t be afraid to ask for her when inside were screaming for help.

&lt;p&gt;From a young age, women, men and the whole society are branded into a certain group of people. There’s the popular, the anti-social, the gamers, the geeks, the list goes on. I often think people don’t mean to do this but come on the whole concept of life scares people, so they think fitting into a group of people is easier then fitting into the world but do they really fit in…? 
I think they want to believe they do, the world needs to realise the pureness of each individual and realise the crushing pressure we put on young individuals to fit in. Forcing a girl to fit in to the popular group so she mask her feeling and covers her face to live in a life that isn’t her, we force the boys to learn all the football terms and all the latest game so there in the cool groups and so they try to mask the fact they don’t like who they are anymore.
The story is closer to my heart then I like to think, Girls are always told from a young age weather from the bullies or my inter demons that they don’t belong, THEY WONT BELONG, WE WONT BELONG.
the fact that a young girl from around nine years old has to now start watching over her shoulder sat at the school dinner table in case the school bullies are coming over, but what will she get called today, freak, nerd.
No not that today, that the girl could handle, she’s used to that, it feels like that vocabulary is normally, it’s just everyday life. But no, today wasn’t like the rest of them, the school bullies walked straight past without a word, without a stare, the little innocent girl was relieved but didn’t show it, just so the bully’s wouldn’t notice and circle back around like angry vultures. The girl almost felt bad that maybe they have found someone else. But that’s the lesson the world teaches us from such a young age is that we look out for our selfs.
The little girl was silly to think it was over, three o’clock strikes and the bullies are stood out the school gate, this was the magic age when a young girl gains the independence to walk home by herself, however this little girl was no long glad of this independence, she felt unsafe.
The girls, the bullies, the vultures whatever you want to call them, followed the innocent girl home, shouting horrendous names at her; chubby, ugly, weirdo, freak the list went on but when the names turned into action, then she got scared. 
She learn to run as fast as she could that week, she needed to be home where she was safe. The young girl had to learn to put a brave face on and wait until the door was closed to break the wall down and let out the tears. 
Two weeks went by and nothing had changed over than the young girl changing her emotions, she was no longer scared but no, not of the bullies, she was no longer scared of dying.
That day the vultures got braver that normally and waited outside the young girls house, she didn’t know where to go, what to do, her safe place was gone. They stood verbally abusing her until she broke down the the floor, that’s when a spying eye from across the road saw and spooked them, the girl didn’t have a clue who all she knew was she was grateful.

,depression,"Although I had friends to hang out with my first few years of college, I really got a semblance of genuine feeling for the potential meaning for certain friends.

I've always drifted alone and assumed on and off that my life is an unreliable uncertainty in terms of my desires and feelings. I moved to a different city and had fun with people who got to know the changed me and matched up with the ideals of my growth. I moved back home and no longer feel that connection through not having stayed in touch through text or call. If we were to meet in person, there are only so few that I would genuinely perhaps enjoy the company. Within those few, I have emotional hurt associated with the memories of the past. I want to fade into a fantasy and develop myself solo and develop my hobbies and skills and assume that this is a new phase where maybe I don't get as close anymore to people and friends. I still feel hurt and am not ready to open or interested in initiate the steps to open up. I'm the same person, changed, but I'm getting older. Maybe I have feelings for some people but neither party is reaching out and I'm choosing to soak in this feeling of bitter sadness at innocence and closeness that may have felt very real in the past.

This has been a problem for most of my life (since my freshman year of hs), I failed almost all of my classes and eventually dropped out of highschool. It's almost impossible to bring myself to study because of it and whenever I do, I learn nothing

I've been trying to get this medical lisence for two years now (most people have gotten this specific one in 5 months but it's been 25+ and I still am not even close lmao) and I'm in a do or die situation. The coronavirus put me in a very serious situation, won't say too much about it other than if I don't get this lisence by August and get my job, I could be going from well off to living on the streets.

,depression,"Hi all, I'm writing this out for a couple of reasons. One is that I want to see how I am feeling compares to your experiences and two as a record that I can look back on (I think writing things down helps so much but rarely do I do it).

So here it goes.

As a background I've been diagnosed with dep and am an meds.

Felt pretty much ok on Monday, not great but ok. A little stressed from work but nothing that I couldn't handle. A few things happened later on in the week some work related stuff (said I didn't want to work for someone and it got out to them) and some personal stuff (felt that a friend had started to become distant for some reason). On Wednesday I really noticed a shift in my mood, became low and irritable, started to withdraw. Flatemate had a friend over but I hid in my room (my thoughts were that I am such a looser that I am ashamed to be in the presence of normal people).

Thursday was worse, a really struggled to get out of bed, couldn't concentrate on work, started to feel there in no point in the work I do. Again there were guests over, but I hid. Withdrawing from workmates and housemates. Suicidal ideation again. Feeling so angry with myself and the world. Nearly in tears (I never cry).

I've pretty much stated in bed all day today. I dont want to talk to friends. Some moments of felling better, but the clouds return pretty quickly. I think the approaching weekend isnt helping. I am lonely and ashamed of how lonley I am. I just want to be normal and have a normal life. Thinking about getting old alone - what's the point when you havent made memories with anyone? I have plans fo rending it when that time comes. It is a comforting thought to me that I can 'opt out'. All the 'good stuff' I was thinking about myself and my futures only just a few days ago seems like lies now and that I was delusional for ever believing it.

,depression,"I've suffered from depression for years. Diagnosed when I was 16 but I suspect it was festering for at least several years before that. Also 99% sure I have ADHD but can't get a diagnosis or treatment for that because I'm not a disruptive five year old boy.


I want to die. I don't have anything to live for except not hurting my parents... but I'm starting to think they hate me being alive as well. I'm a burden. I can't do anything right. Every time they tell me they love me or hope I feel better soon it just feels like meaningless platitudes... like that's what they have to say because they're my parents. Rationally, I know that's probably not true, but it's getting harder and harder to believe that.


I moved back in with my parents just before lockdown started in full force in the UK. At first it was pretty good, my mum especially made a big thing of fussing over me and looking after me. Then I got furloughed after working from home for a couple of weeks and things started to go downhill. I still thought I was doing okay until about four or five days ago when I went from ""mildly to moderately ehhh"" to barely being able to get out of bed, crying multiple times a day for little/no reason (e.g., my parents didn't say hello when I went downstairs to grab a drink = they must hate me and wish I wasn't there), and having no motivation to do anything, even play my favourite games.


I've been terrified of saying this to anyone because it feels like a fast track to being labelled as schizophrenic, but it's like there's a voice in my head. It's callous and cruel. It tells me to kill myself over and over every single day, just a constant stream of abuse. That I'm stupid, worthless, useless, fat, ugly, just kill yourself, nobody would miss you, you have nothing to live for.


Just before this latest slide into deep depression, I was following up on some job prospects that would take me out of London (where my current permanent address and workplace are) back up north to Leeds, closer to my parents and in an area where property prices are much saner. I thought it was the start of getting my life properly on track and getting to a place where I could be happy. Now I don't think I can ever be really happy like normal people are. Even if it all worked out and I bought a house... I'm useless at cleaning thanks to executive dysfunction and just being a slobby bitch. I have this image in my head of a beautiful Instagram-worthy house but I know really I would never have that. I don't deserve to own a house. I don't deserve anything.


There's something deeply, deeply wrong with me that I don't think can be fixed or even managed so that I can function properly long term. I've tried medication but have enormous problems remembering to take it (tried alarms, reminders, everything) and the constant on-off-on-off makes me even worse. I've been to counselling when I was at uni but was shoved out the door the second I admitted to the mildest improvement in my mood and then when I inevitably needed help again I was put on a six week long waiting list.


The only counsellor I feel has ever helped even a little was an old guy I saw in sixth form who basically let me spend an hour a week in his office crying and saying very little while he made small talk and didn't judge me for struggling. I really doubt I'd ever find that in the NHS (because, understandably, they need to free up spaces for people who can actually be helped) and I can't afford private therapy.


At this point, my only solace is hoping I can one day get a big lottery win or some other improbably windfall that would let me buy a house in the middle of nowhere so I don't bother anyone and nobody bothers me and I can just be alone without having to worry about work or socialising ever again.",t2_3bvweqbs,False,,0,False,I don't think I'll ever be happy,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hbh23s,False,dark,0.86,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,,1592495620.0,,[],{},,True,,1592523811.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve suffered from depression for years.

&lt;p&gt;They enforced me and probably still think that only because I used to be the one always there for them, that I can still somehow do that? But I fucking can’t. I can’t do this shit anymore. I’m so tired. So exhausted. Friendships have become so exhausting to me. Conversations became so exhausting to me. My mind and memory space became a major shit place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is now blended in together and I can’t think clearly anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why they can’t see that, that I’m not doing ok. And if I am telling them that I am not, they say to ’talk about my feelings’ and ’I should reach out more because I’m not putting anything to our friendship!’ ...Allegedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me to feel like such a fucking annoyance all the time. Wish it wasn’t like this. Wish I wasn’t like this. Only Really Exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

Anticipation of Violence&amp;Danger feels euphoric to me, i don't want to hurt anyone or myself but this line of thinking is very ""motivating"",  the anticipation of mortal danger alone is rewarding enough to make me do the things i need to get my life back on track, the irony is so funny i can't help but laugh.

I believe these are consequences to Sensory deprivation. we are a social species  and our survival rate outside groups is low, our brain compensates for it by anticipating death. I suppose, acting out and being hyper-aggressive got our lone wolf ancestors succeed.

,depression,"tl;dr: How do I kill my jealousy when meeting new people who have their shit mostly together.

I'm at a point in life where I feel very behind. So naturally when speaking with new people I meet online I feel as though I've entered a minefield of sorts. The minefield being that I want to avoid them telling me about goals and achievements thus far in their life. Whether it be, that they have a partner, or have a good job or even that they've started a family. I'm good at pushing through the initial sting of jealousy, but when every person you meet seems to have much more going for them than myself, it weighs down like a ton of bricks.

I get it, jealousy is a big no-no. I don't wear it on my sleeves, I feel it, but I keep it buried, but it tears me up like a son of a bitch. I want to start connecting with more people in life to drag myself out of this crummy mindset, but I'm really not looking forward to being reminded of how much I let pass me by in life. I've done pretty much nothing for the last like 8 years, I'm 24. I still manage to keep it together, but I feel as though I am going to start cracking and give up all the way. This is not fun, the jealousy is pure shit, it's my goddamn achilles heel. 

I'm not jealous of the fact someone has a partner, i'm jealous they've got the get-up-and-go to get one. Not jealous of the jobs they have, but the fact they can get up and go do them day-in-day-out.

,depression,"Just to clarify i do think she's a good therapist i just dont think she's good for me.

I started getting therapy a few years ago and when i asked for it from my mam she went and found me the ""perfect"" therapist.
It wasnt in bad faith but she got me a therapist i could literally be friends with, that she knew i could relate to.
This was a bad idea if i had known thats what she was doing i would of intervened.
The only thing I've gotten out of my therapy is being able to talk about thing that bother me to another living person (I have never spoken to anyone else about my problems it makes me very uncomfortable) beside that ive been the one doing  all the work, i only discuss things I've already figured out for myself because she never asks about specific things she only ever says ""so how are you"" at the start of our sessions and i feel like it would be less awkward for me to get into all of my shit if she felt like a therapist instead of an adult friend.
Recently its started to feel more and more repetitive.
Im scared to talk to her about it because i like her and i dont want her to think she's a bad therapist but i think she shares to much stuff with me(she's mentioned that she herself goes to therspy and i know a fair bit about her family dynamics) and even though it's usually not that personal it makes the sessions feel more like a discussion with a friend rather then a therapy session and i usually leave never having discussed what i wanted to. 
I know she cant mind read and that i have to make an effort but i already do that and i need help with talking about things its my biggest struggle thats why i go to therapy in the first place.
Im just terrified if i talk to her about this she'll react badly and if that happens i think I'll just completely spiral.
And if i do talk to her about it im not sure if i should ask for a new therapist or if i should ask her to change tactics because i actually dont think her primary therapist qualification (i dont know what you would call it) is people with depression which is me.
Or is it me? Am i just doing therapy wrong?",t2_5owkmvj0,False,,0,False,I dont think i have a good therapist,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hbo651,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592546992.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify i do think she&amp;#39;s a good therapist i just dont think she&amp;#39;s good for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started getting therapy a few years ago and when i asked for it from my mam she went and found me the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; therapist.
It wasnt in bad faith but she got me a therapist i could literally be friends with, that she knew i could relate to.
This was a bad idea if i had known thats what she was doing i would of intervened.
The only thing I&amp;#39;ve gotten out of my therapy is being able to talk about thing that bother me to another living person (I have never spoken to anyone else about my problems it makes me very uncomfortable) beside that ive been the one doing  all the work, i only discuss things I&amp;#39;ve already figured out for myself because she never asks about specific things she only ever says &amp;quot;so how are you&amp;quot; at the start of our sessions and i feel like it would be less awkward for me to get into all of my shit if she felt like a therapist instead of an adult friend.

,depression,"So the guy I formally called my best friend (he’ll be M), for a while, had a thing for my sister (she’ll be H) and she had a thing for him. I personally never felt comfortable with the whole thing it made me feel more like a third wheel and that if anything went wrong, it could ruin everything.

Well, for years he would constantly promise me that nothing happens and, “you’re my best bro, I think a relationship between us would feel kind of weird.”

My sister on the other hand, who already has a nasty attitude, has always been more demanding of a relationship with him, treating me like the bad guy when I say no. She even went as far as to use the, “you’re my brother”, or, “your his best friend” argument against me, saying I don’t care.

Well, early last year, I did say yes. However, I only said it just because f how sick I was of the whole thing (I really regret that). For a while last year, H did end up in a relatively happy relationship with another boy and they even made it past six months. Despite all of that, she still kept whining that she wasn’t with M and even he was acting kind of rude about her being in a relationship (especially after he broke up with his girlfriend). He would tell her that her boyfriend that he looked suspicious and even blocked her on Snapchat for being in so much pain. After she broke up with him (which she wasn’t too upset about), she immediately got int a relationship with M. When he talked about it with me, he assured me that he didn’t intend to hurt me or anything like that, so I said okay. At the time, I was hurt after he made a promise that he wouldn’t do this. I only said okay because I didn’t know what to say, aside from this, I was depressed about school and the fact I wasn’t working, so I felt dead by the time he told me.

Throughout the relationship, it felt super awkward; as if they kind of forced each other to do this. Aside from that, there were several days my sister would be in tears because he forgot a date (normally fell asleep or just decided to stay in). Well, by January of this year, after getting fired from his job, he decided to just join the marines on a whim, which came as a shock to me and my friends. To my sister, however, she was devastated and, of course, tried to pressure me into solving this, as if I’d know what to do. Well, after a month of him training with them, M became a little more neglectful of the relationship which made my sister feel even worse. Well, one day they were going to go out together, but he of course forgot, and when she asked him why, he just told her, “things change, okay!” She was broken up about this and, of course, demanded I fix everything despite me wanting to study for a test I had to take in a couple of days. When I texted him about what he said and how I was shocked to see this side of him, he immediately snapped at me, even saying, “I’m not her little puppy, so I’m not going to do everything she wants me to do!”, and, “I’m sticking my guns, even if it’s against my best friend!” That day was awful; the guy I called my best friend saw me as some sort of obstacle in his way and my sister, who I didn’t want in a relationship with him in the first place is demanding me to fix everything, even spamming my phone when I wasn’t textihin her back every 1 minute, so I couldn’t even have a single moment to myself that day. 

After that incident, M constantly kept spamming me with texts about how sorry he was and how the relationship with H might not have been a good idea. He kept trying to meet up with me, but kept forgetting the days we were supposed to meet up or just oversleeping, because of how much he’s “been training (and staying up all night playing COD with his Xbox live friends). 

A couple of weeks after the incident, he finally broke off the relationship because he didn’t want any pressure of a relationship while he’s with the marines, which left H feeling even more devastated while she kept crying out about how “it’s not fair” the breakup was. M told me that he didn’t mean to hurt her, but that he felt she was a little too needy and obsessive (he’s honestly not wrong there, unfortunately) and that it would be too much for him to handle. He was telling me that the reason he went out with her for what was essentially less than six months (both of their previous relationship lengths) was because, “she was a sweet girl (meh, not really)” and that after his break up, he wanted to simply give this girl who liked him a chance. That answer, I realized when he told me wasn’t so much a lie, rather just an exaggeration to more so fit his own narrative. As long as I’ve known him, it makes sense since he’s done this to suit his narrative on any topic he may have a specific opinion on and doesn’t want to be proven wrong on. Regardless, he promised me once again, that he would never do this again.

As of late May, he’s been saying that he’ll get together with me, and that we’ll plan some hangout together, but he keeps missing them because he has other obligations, or sleeps for another 9 hours. Fine, I get it, he’s busy with the marines, but it hurts knowing he would do this to me time and time again, especially after he constantly says he wants to make everything up to me. Despite the fact that we are in a group chat together, he still hasn’t talked to me directly in a month, which I don’t feel good about. It’s only worse because I’ve noticed him and my sister are talking again, having these long conversations together. 

I was scared of this, but I found out that as of last week, they’re starting to see each other again, which pisses me off to no end. H got into a huge argument with my parents about the whole thing. Although I do think my parents are somewhat ridiculous sometimes, I agree with them when they say that M wasn’t faithful to her and was hurting our friendship. She hasn’t been on good terms with them over this whole thing, and spent all of last week posting on her own social media’s about how she the victim in this whole thing; talking about how she and M are truly in love with each other and that they’re only mad at him because, “he was late picking me up one time”, while dancing around the whole entire conflict so she can rewrite it as someone who just wants a fairy tale love with the love of her life and that the ones telling her it’s a bad idea are the bad guys.

I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t devastated all over again. However, I think at this point I’m just going to let them take responsibility for their own mistakes and won’t even consider them wrapping me in their own mistakes. I’m thankful that through all of this, my mom has been so supportive of me; reminding me that I shouldn’t have to deal with this and that I should just focus on myself.

,depression,"Hey everyone,

I am a non-depressed individual who has been spending the last several months learning about mental health. I am not completely sure how depression works just yet, so my apologies in advance if anything comes off as wrong or hurtful.

It seems like there are two *levels* of depression: underlying, ongoing depression and major, isolation depression. Obviously, people can experience both intertwined and that is waaay overgeneralizing it, although after reading through many posts and articles (especially ones with a relationship in the middle), it seems like the first level can be managed okay on its own (using ""managed"" lightly because I know it is difficult enough) and the second level is not manageable by being filled with unpredictability on its own.

This leads into my question: are you able to sense when a major episode/slump is coming? This also transitions into my next question: if so, is this why depressed individuals tend to push others away as an act of protection? I know depression can be confusing to process by itself, although I have come across many of the ""pushing away"" stories and wonder whether the depressed individual is often keen on what is happening or will happen, so they preemptively make the decision to save others from the hurt while undergoing an episode/slump.",t2_kgm35,False,,0,False,Can you sense when a major episode/slump is coming?,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_hbnucp,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592545899.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
