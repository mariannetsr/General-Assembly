domesticviolence,"I'm a 23 year old homeowner (female). I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe ¬£2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around ¬£50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

What am I supposed to do to ensure my safety? The police in the UK are awful at protecting people, and so many domestic abuse victims die \*after\* the relationship ended.

domesticviolence,"Maybe this doesnt belong here Im not sure where to label this since Im kinda confused.   


I have to spill my sin and I think it might qualify as some level of borderline abuse and could really use some advice. Its a graphic story of what just happened though so please don't read if your sensitive.   
My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

domesticviolence,"My main questions are at the bottom if you just wanna skim. 
I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a ‚Äúbreak‚Äú.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't ‚Äúsave‚Äú her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step? She lives in West Melbourne Victoria AUS. what would you say if this was your friend to try to convince them? What would you do?

domesticviolence,"I'm a 34 year old guy who lost his job to covid, living with parents who are emotionally and mentally abusing me. The threat of physical violence is certainly a spectre, but fortunately they have only hit me once since I was a teenager.

Like the title suggests, I know that I'm in a position of privilege compared to many others out there, but this really sucks.

I spend 20 hours in 'my room' per day because they are so miserable to be around. If I go to the kitchen to eat I get harassed for example. That is the absolute lightest of examples. Sometimes they fight and hit each other. When they fight they use any excuse to hide what they did, or they tell me that it was my fault.

I pretty much have no social interactions besides going to the grocery store.

I don't have the financial means to move out. I've got a spazzy dog, and I'm in a mid sized Northwest city where housing costs are absolutely ridiculous even without pet deposits. I've considered giving the dog away, but that is a heartbreaking thought when you have nothing and no friends.

domesticviolence,"Not sure if what I'm experiencing could be verbal or emotional abuse? My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps.

domesticviolence,"
This is my life story.

I am 30 year old female living in india. I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and¬†learned¬†to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.¬† When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally.¬†

I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its¬†alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. 

After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.
But when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying¬†for,¬†you are crying as if I raped you. 

After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.
Once the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.
I tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.
In spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.¬† But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.
they sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.

Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.
 But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.

domesticviolence,"I'm F16 (soon to be 17 in a month) from England and my mum has been married to a man since 2017/2018, who has been abusive emotionally and physically. I live separately from them in my grandma's house with her friend (he take care of her). I'm writing this at 2am while crying, so it might lack detail/not correct wording - ask questions if you need.

After they got married, they had a baby daughter. Before she was born, I remember my mum coming home early in the morning after being out all night. I was staying up for her, and when she came home she was crying. It got a lot of asking, but she told me that he punched her in the stomach (she was 2 months into the pregnancy).

After that incident, something else happened. I'm not sure clearly about what did, but she had accidently cut him after he tried to grab a knife from her in the kitchen (he was drunk) which resulted in him having a big cut on his finger. He called the police, and before they came, he began throwing death threats at me (I was in the living room and he was at the door of it yelling at mr). He told me that if I didn't get out of the house when he returned (from the hospital), that he would kill me and my whole family. This might have happened after the police came, but I'm not sure. He also yelled at me, calling me things like bitch, slut, etc. My grandma came to pick me up. He never apologised, but my mum forgave him.

Nothing really happened for the two years, apart from him continually yelling things at my mum like bitch, slut, saying she was useless, telling her not to do certain things, etc. I also remember him threatening to kick my mum out of the house, when they lived in their old house. He would always hit me, jab me with his hand in a way, but play it off as a joke.

Something else happened last month though. Me, my mum, and my little sister (around 1 year and 3 months old) had went out and we came back to their new house. The house is one floor, it was a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. When he came home, he began drinking. Me and my mum went to the bedroom, to put my little sister to sleep, while he was in the living room. My little sister was crying a lot, but we still tried to put her to sleep. She's quite stubborn, lol. I took her from my mum, and had her on my upper body, trying to make her sleep. He came into the bedroom, and tried to take her away from me. I said that it was okay and that I can get her to sleep, but he still tried to take her away from me. At first he was just trying to take her, but then he began to grab my hands really hard and sort of jab them (like he was trying to dig his nails into my hands, but with his fingers?) but I kept persistenting. He became more violent in doing it, until he took his hand and put it around my neck, really hard, and began squeezing it until I could barely breathe and felt my vision going away a bit. I called the police. While I was on the phone with them, I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room (they're opposite from the house), he kept yelling at me saying he was going to kill me by cutting/stabbing me, he kept calling me things like bitch, slut, he kept saying that he didnt want a disabled person in the house (I'm blind in one eye), he kept saying to me to leave and that this would be the last time I would be in the house. When the police came after 10 minutes, I explained what happen and told them about the incident of where he threatened me. They asked questions on his previous behaviour, and I told them. They said that the only thing they could do is take me home.

After the incident, I kept having suicidal thoughts. I also had thoughts that he was going to come to me and kill me, like he would find me in the street and bash my head against the pavement, or how he was going to come to my house and kill me. As it's my birthday in a month, my mum told me she was going to come to my house with him and my sister to give me cake. I told her I didnt want him to come, and she asked me why. I told her how he made me feel, about the thoughts I had. She told me to think about how hard it was for her to bring the cake while with my little sister. I told her I also self harm because of it, and she told me I did it before what he did (this is true, but I also did it after/as result of what he did). She doesnt try to help me, and she keeps on defending him by saying he was angry, or how he has problems with his job, etc (this is also the same for when he threaten me the first time). She told me she would help me, and that she loved me more than him. My grandma bashes me for it, after what happen I didnt leave me room for a week/eat and she keeps saying about how it affected her. Because my mum bring my sister for us to take care of her when she work, he has to come and pick her up after 4PM. I leave to go upstairs so I dont have to see him, and my grandma said ""you're leaving like someone will hurt you"" (I'm not sure how to translate it).

My mum says she cant leave him because she doesn't want to live in my grandmas house ""under control"", and how she wont have money if she leaves (she has job, but I dont think it give much money)

No one is on my side. My family won't help me.

domesticviolence,"Hello. As the title says, I have a family member that is physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive towards his 8.5 month pregnant girlfriend. The rest of the family is feeling pretty hopeless as ""she is the one that instigates it"" and ""they really should just break up"" and ""it's not our place to intervene"". 

He is an addict and abuses steroids, and his mood swings are explosive and dangerous. He strangles her at family dinners, hits, screams at, and threatens her, and has pushed her out of moving vehicles more than once (all while pregnant). 

It is not hyperbolic to expect that he will one day kill her and/or their child without intervention. Is there a way for me to anonymously report him?

I met with a lawyer. I‚Äôm still in the planning stages of filing for divorce. I hope a position opens up near my parents several hours away so I can transfer near them with my employer. But with COVID and ability to work from home, I may not need to do that even.

I don‚Äôt want to have my husband served while at work.  The lawyer said I can just tell him that I‚Äôm filing and my lawyer just needs to know where to serve him and then suggest he obtain a lawyer and the lawyer can serve him divorce papers through his lawyer. 

We have child so it will need to go through mediation and requires 90 day waiting period so I don‚Äôt want to wait too much  longer. It would be easier if the children were back in school to have this conversation with him. But with COVID, I‚Äôm also scared to have this conversation with him while home alone.  So at this rate, I probably won‚Äôt file until end of August.

domesticviolence,"A defining moment in my recovery from abuse was reading ‚ÄúThe Gifts of Imperfection‚Äù by Bren√© Brown. If you are not familiar with Bren√© Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her.¬†

Any who, my defining moment while reading ‚ÄúThe Gifts of Imperfection‚Äù was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said:¬†

‚ÄúThe word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means ‚Äúto speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart‚Ä¶\[s\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can‚Äôt survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.‚Äù Bren√© Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection 

I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:

‚ÄúMy story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.‚Äù¬†

With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, ‚ÄúI REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!‚Äù¬†

So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.

But first, some facts:

According to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):

* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.
* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out.¬†
* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves.¬†
* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave.¬†
* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes.¬†

Even though I consider my ‚ÄúFreedom Date‚Äù to be May 20th, 2015, I didn‚Äôt finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn‚Äôt afraid to go if he didn‚Äôt make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage.¬†

After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother.¬†

The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn‚Äôt told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn‚Äôt having it. I didn‚Äôt get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn‚Äôt fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúliving‚Äù my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep.¬†

That night showed me that he wasn‚Äôt abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home.¬†

We made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn‚Äôt remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn‚Äôt know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered.¬†

The next morning, on Sunday, he didn‚Äôt understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn‚Äôt welcome to my parents house and to drop me off.¬†

When I arrived, I told my family we weren‚Äôt doing well and I wasn‚Äôt sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze‚Ä¶ I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn‚Äôt home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn‚Äôt. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never ‚Äúordered‚Äù me. She texted me back and said, ‚Äúget in your car and come home.‚Äù I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn‚Äôt do anything.¬†¬†

The next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was.¬†

At the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn‚Äôt get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once.¬†

I often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it‚Äôs easy to get down on ourselves for not being ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It‚Äôs hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is:¬†

Leaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible.¬†

There is no perfect way to do it.

Leaving abuse is messy.¬†

If leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process.¬†

It takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise.¬†There is life after domestic violence.¬†

Per usual, I have to say, if you are ready to leave an abusive relationship I STRONGLY encourage you to talk to a trained advocate at a[ local shelter](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help#?page=1) or the[ National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/).

domesticviolence,"I'm hoping that someone can give me advice or just some moral support.  I have been with my bf for four and a half years, at least two and a half of those have been abusive.  Things really stepped up at the start of the year and with the lockdown the levels of emotional abuse, sexual coercion and the fear of angry moods and threats to sleep with other people have been unbearable.  Things reached a fever pitch a couple of weeks ago after I was coerced into a threesome I had categorically said I did not want to do, after being plied with alcohol and drugs.  I have been really struggling since then.

I asked him to leave last Monday after he told me he wanted to sleep with men.  And then I begged him to leave on Tuesday.  He keeps saying that we are a union and will work it out.  He pretended that everything was fine the next two days, telling me over and over how he couldn't wait to spend Friday night with me and to have sex.  Friday night comes around and he smokes a huge amount of weed and ignores me all night, texting and not replying when I talk to him.  It gets to nearly 11pm and I look over at him as he's still texting.  He gets very cross and accused me of giving him dirty looks and asks why.  I explained that I was really upset that he had ignored me all night and broken his work to me yet again, despite promising me that he wanted to fix that.  He made some excuse about it being the lockdown and how the world was different and then told me that I should be happy anyway as he was texting about setting up sleeping with a guy.  I lost it.  I shouted and cried, I told him how if spent hours getting ready, cleaning up, looking nice etc and he looked me up at down in disgust and laughed in my face.  He shoved me across the kitchen at some point and the. Said something I really can't remember and I flew at him, kicked his legs and told him I would like to slit his throat.  It was wrong, I should have kept my temper but I needed him to see just how much pain he has caused me.

Of course he flees the house, runs to his friends, tells them all I'm an alcoholic and he's suffering from domestic violence.  He's had me referred to mental health professionals and I've ended up being passed on for an alcohol dependency intervention.  I've explained to every professional what is happening and they are all very understanding but I'm just in turmoil.  I really don't know what to do.  I just want to believe that he hasn't done any of this on purpose.  I've just spoken to him again about the way he treats me and it doesn't matter what I say, or what I show he finds a way to say it's somehow my fault.  I feel really broken.

domesticviolence,"I have lived in an abusive relationship for about 5 years now and finally got rid of him in a few months ago. It went far (as usual with this guy) and he got a restraining order, after I called the cops on him ( I really had to, he was drunk and was chasing me in my own apt). 

But this was not the first time. It has happened 7 or 8 times before that he has gone violent on me to the point that I had to call the police. I know l, I've been stupid to take him back but trust me, ge is a master manipulator and said all the right things when he was ""sorry"". 

He used to get drunk or high and made me break up with him since he was a coward and couldn't do it. I hope you get the picture here. All of this has been very painful to me, bc I really loved him. I have now, since the last time he fucked up, decided to never take him back again and kept my promise. 

He hasn't contacted me, but i know that is only bc there is a restraining order on him. I'm sure he'll reach out one way or another and do as usual, beg me to come back for he has changed an so on. 

I now understand that he never loved me and only wanted to owe me and use my energy so I promised myself to not give him another second of my life.

Then came the call. Today, the day after my birthday and it was my lawyer, telling me that the cops want to speak to me one last time and then they have enough to prosecute him and it will go to court. The probability of him getting a jail sentence is high. 

Now comes the dilemma. I want to leave this behind. I'm happy I have the restraining order so he won't come near for another 4 months at least , but I am so so afraid. If I do proceed with this, it will take more of my time and energy that I really don't want to put in this bs anymore, cuz I'm so tired of this drama, but if I don't do it he probably won't leave me alone.

Wtf should I do. I study at uni and really want to focus on that. That's really all I want to do.

domesticviolence,"I've had many relationships in my life from a young child that led to me finding myself in an abusive relationship with my alcoholic ex (we dated from 2014-2018, me - f27-31, him - m34-38).  I do believe him to be a narcissist, which I definitely think came from the way he was raised.  He has a strong history of abuse, but as he gets older, he's getting a little tamer, and he's running out of options due to  living with his mother and being well over the age of being able to pull the same crap.  That being said, he got a DUI with our daughter and his previous two children earlier this year, and he's still being enabled, but he's also being tested.  He does really well when he stays in support groups and surrounds himself with positive influence rather than his friends that have the same habits of drinking/ruining lives.

Anyway.  Through a course of events, his current girlfriend reached out to me after seeing a post I shared on fb about covid and how it's been hard working at a long-term care facility because we're hurting and they are more my family than my own family has been and got me through an awful time in my life.  She asked if her boyfriend/my ex was my abuser.  I didn't give details, because I don't want to mess up anything good he's got going on (I need him to improve for our daughter), but part of me didn't want to scare her off because my daughter's safer if she's around.  She has kids, boys the same age as my older ones, and my ex - during child drop off - mentioned that one of them has anxiety issues.  Internally I freaked, because my mind went to my middle boy who's got adhd and struggles socially, talking to himself in the same manner my ex used to.  Having to discuss my ex's behavior with my ex-husband because it got brought up during sessions with their psychiatrist (adhd medication management).   I wanted nothing more than to not end up like my mom.  In some ways I haven't, and I'm proud of myself for that.  But I've got a long way to go to forgive myself for not putting them first and getting them away from that environment sooner.  Every move I make now is to ensure a peaceful home environment and luckily they have a lot of support all around, so they'll be okay I think.  I do talk to them about stuff that happened and why abuse occurs and that we can't hold on to anger towards that person, we just have to hope that they can heal whatever hurt them...and we don't have to spend time with people that don't make us feel good/scared, but we also don't have to hurt them or wish more on them. 

That being said, and maybe it's my inner child's lack of understanding - Covid has really put a hamper on finding a therapist (I need in-person therapy - I have adhd myself, if you haven't noticed yet lol, so phone stuff is difficult) but what if this isn't a phase?

What if he actually changes?

Obviously, that would be the most amazing thing - my dad went on to raise another family and I don't want that for her, so he HAS to change in order for that to be successful...

I know that a lot of these things were not a result of who I am as a person, and I don't allow behavior that isn't productive so I feel like I've got a decent grip on the logical side of things...but right now, with not being able to properly do my job (activities in a retirement/long-term care facility), feeling like I failed my kids (I'm much less patient than I used to be, I'm really working on that), my mental and physical health being out of sorts from years of neglect due to trying to survive on top of autoimmune thyroid issues, adhd, only having one hand with my residual limb starting to suffer overuse after 13 years, and not being able to see a professional - it's hitting me a little harder that he's treating her so well.  

I'm not a bad person, and while math isn't my strong suit - I can still count to 15 depending on my shoe choice - and I understand common denominators.  I know I have value.  But, why wasn't I worth being treated better?  The thought of an apology makes me horrendously sad, because it won't fix anything.  I love what I have now.  But I still lost regular access to seeing his two kids that I formed a relationship with, and now I have to share time with my sweet baby and nothing will ever change that, no matter how well he treats people from here on out.  That makes me really sad, and I don't know why.","I know it's probably a phase, but it still hurts.",hookersince06,2020-06-15 18:51:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h9mbmj/i_know_its_probably_a_phase_but_it_still_hurts/,1,1.0,9,10,849

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn‚Äôt listening to me saying ‚Äúno ‚Äú repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don‚Äôt want this, I don‚Äôt know who you are, and even cried ‚Äúrape‚Äù over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn‚Äôt believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying ‚Äúno, not YOU! Not you not you!‚Äù Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream.

domesticviolence,"My neighbor moved in two weeks before the lockdown happened.  This is an almost an exclusively white neighborhood.  When we met he spoke about how there were racists in his last apartment complex and I assured him that my girlfriend and I and the other tenant were not racist.

About two weeks after he moved in, we heard him and girlfriend yelling at each other.  Sometimes it was during the day, sometimes it would be in the middle of the night.  We never said anything because we didn't know how to address it.  We told the landlord a few times about it and we don't know how he addressed it but he said he did.

Eventually we could hear things getting physical.  It sounded like there was a knock down drag out fight happening next door.  We called the cops.  When the cops came the couple had left the apartment to go for a walk and the cops couldn't really do anything.  As a white person, I was very hesitant to call the cops on a black man.  As far as I know he doesn't know we have called the cops.

There has been little noise coming from their apartment but we hear some things now and again.  When the girlfriend isn't wearing long sleeve shirts you can see the bruises on her arms.

Today I heard his girlfriend yell, ""stop, you're hurting me!""  We called the landlord and our landlord called him.  We could hear our neighbor yelling at the landlord that he was afraid for his life and that she is having medicine issues and it makes her scream.  He feels like everyone hates him and that we're playing around with his life.  Our landlord said he spoke with the girlfriend and she said she wasn't being abused.  Which I do not think that any victim would say they were being abused while the accused is in the same room.

We do not know how to resolve this issue.  We want to talk to them but they seem to not be admitting what's going on.  I could be wrong I suppose, maybe she's has an issue that makes her yell and scream in the middle of the night when no one is abusing her.   I don't want to call the cops on a black man where things could escalate and he could be killed.  I don't want to do nothing and let either one of them hurt the other one.  Its causing us real emotional distress having to listen to it.  It doesn't seem like it's a good idea to confront your neighbors about how one of them is being abused or how they might be abusing each other.

domesticviolence,"My sister (27) is emotionally abusive towards my parents and myself. I think she might have a mental illness but its hard to tell because she hasn't ever seen any therapist or psychologist about it. She refuses to speak to me ever, so I asked my mom to initiate the conversation with her to see a professional. My mother has spoken to her, and my sister agreed but then they both seemed to forget about it and nothing came of that. 

My mother (53) and my sister are close. My mother is easily manipulated. She's always been a rooter for the underdog and has always had the personality where she wants to help everyone. This is how my sister sucks her in. My mother listens to her sop stories about how life is so hard and her self esteem is just so low; then my mother falls for it. 

Noth my mom and sister have hysterical outbursts sometimes at various people in my family. Often times over silly, small things. If my sister is upset about something my mother acts as her lapdog and begins doing her bidding. They often gang up on myself and my dad. 

My father (60) is a little slow mentally, and old. He was not the best father or husband growing up and my sister harbours a deep hatred for him. She picks fights with him and my mom does her bidding. My sister is extremely controlling. For example, the other day she picked a fight with my dad because he opened to juice bottle on the dinner table before she could open it. 

This is taking its toll on both my mother and father, and possibly my sister too. My mother is developing an addiction to asprin and sleeps for most of the day. She also complains of physical ailments. My father has severe heart disease and is not taking it well either.

domesticviolence,"19F

Almost everyone in my family has been abused and has in turn abused. There's other fucked up shit like grandparents being related to each other and a host of medical and mental problems. Our mother abused us when we were younger for no reason, not that abusers ever need a reason to abuse. My goal since I was a child was just to get away from this fucked up family and never look back.

Our father never defended us from our mother, and I will never forgive him for that, but we grew closer over the last few years. At the same time, I don't really know what influenced my brother to become the abuser he is now. Sure, I am also full of rage about my mother's past abuse and how everyone denied it, justified it or made excuses. But it couldn't have just been that.

My brother has flunked school, started drinking and smoking weed, and doesn't try hard enough to not be a NEET. Besides that, about 2 years ago he started assaulting our mother and breaking objects, including stuff he needs. He assaulted our mother during last Christmas lunch in front of my mum's side of the family. He even started to scream at me and insult me for being too 'smart' and 'uppity' in conversations. Everyone thinks he's extremely jealous of me because I'm doing so well despite my circumstances.  Then recently we found out he's been smoking weed for the past few months and does not intend to stop it.

The worst thing is that sometimes I think the assaults are my fault. I try to talk to him as little as possible. But sometimes, it'll go from one of us asking to pass the salt, to my brother insulting me, and then him arguing with one of my parents, and someone assaulted or something broken.

My parents didn't want to go to the police because they didn't want him to have a criminal record. They attempted to make a report once but found a pretty shitty police service (normal in our area), so they didn't do it. At first my parents tried to discipline him. But it only made him more volatile. So then they just tried to help him. He never responded to anything, just kept getting worse and worse. He literally does what he likes and we can't control him.

As of now he's broken: 2 old but useful laptops, 3 new phones, his bathroom mirror, the fruit bowl, our stained glass door, 2 glasses, a jar of peanut butter, a computer, a fan, glass sheets on the furniture, damaged the furniture, a chair, a wifi router and my dad's nose.

The last 7 items all came from one instance yesterday, the worst it's ever been. As usual it started with something simple. Me and him got into an argument, over the weed and everything. Then my parents started to talk to him and took over the conversation. He started screaming and insulting my father, screaming that he's a faggot, pufta. My father just locked himself in the bedroom to get away from it. Then he and my mother argued for a minute before his screaming got out of control. He ran into the corridor, slammed the door almost off its hinges, grabbed the monitor and the chair there and threw them to our side of the corridor. They hit and broke the fan and the glass sheet on the furniture. That's when my father came out and shouted at him to get out. As usual they grappled, my father trying to force him out. My brother ended up punching him hard in the nose and ran out.

He punched him so hard there was blood spatter on the wall and black blood immediately started gushing, streaming out of his nose. There were blood drops on the floor all over the place, especially in the sink where he tried to get himself clean. As we were cleaning and the next day, we still found little droplets on random places like the TV screen. There was so much blood coming out we ended up calling the police for an ambulance. The ambulance never arrived (again, shitty police) so my mother went to take my dad to a clinic herself. 

I stayed home. My brother came to the door about 20 minutes after they left. He's been kicked out countless times and knows to take a very long walk or stay out for a few hours before even attempting to come back in. But lately he'd been trying to bash our door down when he got kicked out. He showed up with such nonchalance after being out for only an hour, and expected to be let back in. My parents told me not to let him in for my own safety and I didn't. I told him what they said, that they were never ever going to let him back in again and that he was a criminal, and I cursed at him to get out of there. He left.

And then I started recording the destruction that had occurred, all the damage and the blood in video. My dad usually records that stuff but I wanted to have my own personal record. It's a good thing I did because he was so shocked that he didn't record anything. The entire time I was so calm, I never shed one tear, if I cry then that's extremely rare for me. And I'm ashamed to say that while half my rage towards my brother was because of my dad's injury, the other half was because he broke the computer where I would play video games. 

At this time it was about 9 at night. I stayed up waiting for my parents, waiting to see if my brother got back, waiting to just see what would happen. I watched some Netflix just because nothing else could effectively distract me enough to pass the time. Then my parents came back at about 11. My dad got a doctor's certificate, certifying that his injury was grievous and that his nose had been broken. They had talked and decided that either my brother was going to co-operate with social workers and counselors or they would prosecute him in court to get him out of the house.

I went to sleep because I was so dead tired. In the morning I found out that my brother had not returned and was effectively missing. We waiting until 1 in the afternoon and were in the process of reporting him missing when he turned up. Apparently he walked to a friend's house and slept there (apparently this kid has parents who literally don't give two shits if their kid is smoking weed in the basement or letting in strangers in the middle of the night). We asked him if he felt any shame in causing them that trouble, and he said no, no surprise. My father's face had swelled up and both his eyes had turned black, my brother showed no empathy, never even said a sorry, just said he didn't mean it to cover his ass.

As of now we're in the process of cleaning up all the damage and throwing some things away, and my parents decided not to reveal when they'll be taking him to social services, but it'll be soon.

My brother is dead to me. DEAD. Any good relationship we might have had he decided to ruin it with his petty jealousy. And I will never forgive him for doing what he did to my father, and distracting me from my studies with his daily arguing and screaming and assaults. In the last 5 years I've never seen him show empathy to anyone, or any responsibility for his duties and actions. He is effectively a parasite in our home who will eventually tear it down piece by piece if we let him live here. And the worst part is our grandparents on both sides who keep coddling him and telling us to treat him kindly even though they know about a lot of the stuff that's happened.",My brother seriously injured our father and I don't think I coped in a typical way.

I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive.

This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it‚Äôs been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‚Äòhate‚Äô him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of ‚Äúta-da, gotcha‚Äù type way. 

People always say ‚Äútrust your gut‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know what that looks like any more. I‚Äôm always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I‚Äôm gaslighting....myself. I don‚Äôt trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It‚Äôs like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don‚Äôt want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don‚Äôt want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness.

domesticviolence,"Hi so this is my very first post here, the reason I decided to reach out is that im scared to death.
Some background: my mother passed , from breast cancer when I was 6, my father remarried  immediately, my step mom, father and step grandmother would physically abuse me on a regular basis. Eventually my father also started abusing my step mom, he nearly killed her twice. This continued till I was 16 and they separated. I was shipped off to boarding school, happiest two years of my life. After school got over, I joined college in a neighbouring city, things have been fine the last three years when I lived by myself. Now due to the coronavirus pandemic I'm forced to live with my father in an isolated farm, he has started abusing me again on a daily basis. Threatened to kill me on multiple occasions. I'm scared and don't know what to do. He's far too powerful for me to complain to the police, he absolutely faced no consequences for landing his wife in the hospital. I have no way out right now, I'm a student with no resources and can't just leave home. I'm from India, so me on the streets wouldn't be the best idea.

domesticviolence,"An Open Letter To My Abusive Ex.

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit.

domesticviolence,"4 months ago I went to the police to press charges and get a restraining order. My ex narc was silent the entire time up until last week. I guess he was waiting for things to ""die down"" before he makes an INDIRECT appearance? 

A week ago, I received texts from Amazon but my number isn't associated with my account. 

Yesterday, I received 40+ international calls. This is not no damn coincidence. This guy is annoying as hell. I'm changing my number but should I tell the police? I suspect he posted my number somewhere and these mfs won't stop calling. They call every 5 minutes! 

Can somebody tell me what my next steps are?! I have no evidence that it's him. &amp; I think that's why he's doing it this way so he doesn't violate the restraining order.

domesticviolence,So I‚Äôve been the bread winner of my family for like 5 years I‚Äôm a 25 year old female who lives with my mom sister and my boyfriend. I don‚Äôt bother anyone I pretty much stay in my room and go to work. I only moved my boyfriend in to help me with bills since my mom and sister doesn‚Äôt want to get a job. They have a problem with anything me and my boyfriend do for example they have issues with what we spend our money on and places we go another example is if anything comes up missing they blame it on my boyfriend then find the items and never apologize. I never make big deals about It I just move on from it. Just recently I was on the phone talking to my friend and my sister comes banging at my door asking me why I‚Äôm talking about her which I wasn‚Äôt but even if I was how dare you break my door down and try to fight me over something your not sure is really going on. I‚Äôm very laid back I try to laugh everyday and be happy and people hate seeing that so they try to do anything to get me down. They only try to bother me when my boyfriend is at work which is funny. I feel like their jealous and bored with their lives so they want to bother me because they know I don‚Äôt like confrontation. I feel like they project all their insecurities onto me.

domesticviolence,"I don't even know where to start. I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me.

domesticviolence,"My female friend was cut pretty badly on her hand by a boyfriend / friend. She also told me that she was wandering around the next day all emotionally distressed. I don't really know all of what happened other than there was struggle over a knife she held, as he was angry and tearing the room apart over her not allowing him to borrow her PS4.   


She asked me to keep a secret. I assumed this meant she only told me. So, after a few days of her going dark I started asking around on Facebook looking for friends of hers that might be able to help. Some type of intervention I guess you could say. I did not post anything to her page as I did not want to tip the boyfriend off.  


A few of the people I contacted told me they did not really know her that well. So, I told them nothing. I finally found a close friend, (that she listens to better than me) told her and she was going to talk to her. Later that day she contacted me extremely angry telling me I put my nose where it did not belong, and we will no longer be speaking.  


If I knew where the guys apartment is I would have sent the cops over ideally to arrest him. As personally, if I knew where he lived I would have beat him up or shot him.

domesticviolence,"This is going to be a really long one, but if anyone can stick with it, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. 

(Some background information: I‚Äôm transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we‚Äôll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow ‚Äî I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn‚Äôt want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine ‚Äî sometimes he‚Äôd get upset or overwhelmed, but we‚Äôd stop immediately and I‚Äôd always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we‚Äôre both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn‚Äôt stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn‚Äôt stop ‚Äî he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I‚Äôd confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn‚Äôt be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn‚Äôt say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we‚Äôd have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn‚Äôt do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn‚Äôt stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn‚Äôt realize until it was too late (for example, we‚Äôd be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I‚Äôd realize his hands were where I didn‚Äôt want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I‚Äôd remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn‚Äôt deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove ‚Äî what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I‚Äôd even comfort him afterwards when he‚Äôd get upset and tell me that he hadn‚Äôt even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him ‚Äî why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn‚Äôt aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying ‚ÄúI was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about‚Äù. 

Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I‚Äôm struggling to figure out if I‚Äôm allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn‚Äôt his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn‚Äôt seem extremely mentally impaired)",Do I even have the right to be mad?

A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, ‚ÄúYOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.‚Äù I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said ‚ÄúI wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?‚Äù I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to ‚Äúget rid of her (me).‚Äù He has even chocked me during intimacy. I‚Äôm in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself.

domesticviolence,"I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years. He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex.

domesticviolence,"I was in a relationship for 5 years. I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me.

domesticviolence,"My boyfriend and I are friends with another couple, we'll call them Jane and Tom. At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday.

The situation has been strange, he‚Äôs taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence.

domesticviolence,"If you wanna be spared years of backstory/experiences, then read only the first paragraph, Summary and Conclusion. Rest is just details explaining the type of abuse and problems my brother has caused.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

For starters, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm wanting to ask the internet for some serious advice that my family may not be able to come up with ourselves. It's going to be a pretty lengthy and detail-saturated post, but it's probably best I lay it all out there to really understand the entire picture and what kind of person my brother is.

My brother (38), who lives with my dad (74), has not physically harmed my dad yet, but the possibility keeps increasing with time. What he has done though, is caused a tremendous amount of psychological stress and financial damage.

I want my dad to stop living in fear. His life honestly is not good right now, and it could be if my brother weren't in the picture. I ask for any advice in which my family can use to remove my brother from our lives, or at the very least, my dad's house.

I unfortunately live about an hour half from my dad, and my other brother lives about 30 min, but still it's too far in case there's an emergency. My dad sorta makes matters worse by protecting my brother and covering for him sometimes. He just wants peace and nothing else so he tries to sit on the fence and pretend things are fine, but other times he admits he wishes he was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary:

My brother has had consistent drug and/or mental relapses, which include several physical assaults, verbal assaults, years of jail time, and even death threats against my dad. He shows no signs or ability to reason with anyone or anything, and recently his mental state has decayed so much I don't even consider him a functional adult any longer. He's been basically unemployed for about 10 or more years now living off my dad's income.  He's basically just a hollow shell that nobody wants to be around in fear that something might trigger him. He's potentially very dangerous and at his best, he's still an enormous financial strain and source of stress.

He's had a very up-and-down life since he was 16. He's always been a pretty big troublemaker, but around 18 he was prescribed painkillers (Vicodin) for an injury he sustained. This led him down a never ending road of substance abuse. He was a functional adult back then, but just had an addiction that we all felt he could get past. The entire family was always supportive of him getting clean, but his recoveries always led to a relapse. Each time we all kept encouraging him to get better, and to try again. We were very sympathetic for him. We truly were on his side.

Unfortunately his life never had any stability in it. We believe he's gotten to a point now that he will never change. Sadly his mind just seems to be gone now from all the drugs he's done (he's admitted to mixing pills, using heroine, and a litany of methods to get high that I never heard of. There's nothing left of him that resemble the ""good"" parts of him. Now days he rambles about religion 24/7 as he's become a fanatic, and complains no one loves Jesus as much as he does and how everyone is a fake christian (even entire churches), he confuses being high with feeling the holy spirit etc. Just very unusual behavior all the time that it's just his new normal. Basically he's so unhinged lately, that he's become even more unpredictable, and that scares us.

Nobody really knows for sure if my brother has a mental disorder, has fried his brain, or is just constantly under the influence. My brother never shares doctor information, and the doctors he claims he goes to all sound fake/sketchy so I don't know the validity of anything he tells us. It doesn't help that my dad obfuscates details in his older age a lot more than he used to so we're going to only work with the information I can confirm from my own experiences or through my other brother.

There's so many incidents he's caused, I don't think I can confidently recall them all so I'll just categorize each type of incident and list the most memorable and you can read or skip ahead as you please.

&amp;#x200B;

# Car accidents:

I think he's wrecked about 6 vehicles? Maybe more? A few were ""his"" that my dad bought him, and the rest were my parents' personal vehicles. Amazingly, he hasn't harmed or killed anyone in any of his car accidents, mainly because he doesn't make it very far from his origin and crashes all by himself due to being so inebriated. All vehicles were totaled.

He's wrapped a truck around a mailbox while drunk driving.

* Flipped my mom's Trailblazer after jumping a driveway culvert and landing on a neighbors fence.
* Flipped my mom's Suburban after going into a ditch off the side of the road.
* Yelled at my mom from the passenger seat, where she became so stressed out and accidentally drove her car through their brick garage wall (everyone was okay).
* Caused a 3+ car pile up at a traffic light where he failed to stop. He got injured pretty good, but nothing serious.

His most recent wreck (early this year) and the biggest aftermath, was right after he quit his job of one week and claimed Jesus told him to ""turn the wheel right"" while on the highway. He swerved into the right-side guardrail until coming to a stop where a good Samaritan stopped to assist. My brother then attacks the man until police show up and he attacks the officer as well. It was later discovered he had shoplifted a bunch of clothes. He was arrested obviously. He was in jail for about a month, but eventually was released and showed up back at my dad's.

One of my biggest concerns here is not himself, but the safety of other drivers on the road. I fear he will get someone killed eventually. Nobody feels like they can simply take keys away from him, either. My dad begs to keep peace, and I fear he will take his anger out on my dad in a physical way when no one is there to step in. It seems like we lose any decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Financial Burdens:

Before my mom passed away in 2016, she for the most part, kept my brother in check with her motherly presence. Since then though, my brother has only gotten worse. He was always more tolerable with my mom, but now that he directly has to deal with my dad more often, he is a lot more aggressive.

My dad is too ...nice, afraid, guilty...whatever you want to call it to simply evict my brother. Everyone knows that if he were to kick him out, his reaction would be unpredictable. Ranging anywhere from my brother getting himself killed in a car accident, overdose, violent encounter with someone, or my brother would simply not comply and remain in the house and use physical force if he had to. All of these possibilities make it hard for my dad to make a decision on what to do. Here's some facts about my brother regarding financial burdens:

* He can't hold a job. He occasionally gets a decent job but will blow it in about a month and blames the employer. I can't keep track of how many times he's been fired. He hardly looks for work, and will only consider work positions that aren't beneath him, thus he rarely gets hired anywhere. Over the last decade, he's mostly spent his time sitting at home or fishing with the use of my dad and his (now former) girlfriend's money.
* He was looking to buy a car, but when the salesman ""offended"" him, he pretended to be a bigshot and took his business across the street and literally bought a \~$70k truck that he 9000% can't afford. Somehow my dad ended up making the $700 dollar payments for him. (this is the truck that is now totaled after ""Jesus"" told him to crash it).
* He is currently a patient of a methadone clinic, and I don't know the details but I'm to understand it's not cheap.
* He receives money from my dad to go buy chewing tobacco whenever he runs out
* Just today I found out my brother stole my dad's credit card, stole my dad's car, bought himself a new phone, venmo'd himself $500 and for some reason called 911 and told the dispatcher my dad was having a heart attack and was showing signs of dementia (He wasn't and he isn't). Luckily the paramedics didn't fine my dad or anything.
* He eats a huge amount of food and it's causing my dad to have to grocery shop more often to keep the kitchen stocked.
* He generally breaks household items on accident a lot and my dad has to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Acts of aggression:

All of these acts of aggression are him being under the influence of ""something"". When he's sober, he's typically a normal person. He comes across like a tough guy still, but generally doesn't act nearly a irrational. He doesn't drink since his teenage days really, so we can only assume he is mixing pills. When he's ""high"" he just becomes very dopey in behavior. His voice becomes lower, slower and his eyes look sleepy. However, he is at his most sensitive in this stage and feels like everyone is constantly judging him, but he reacts with aggression, mostly getting in peoples faces, spitting, headbutting, yelling etc.

I just want to be clear that nobody provokes him ever. He is 100% the bully in all situations. Every case is the same where he will take offense to something as minor as disagreeing with him on what temperature to set the oven, or telling him to give you a little space while he speaks, because he's getting spit on your face.

It'd be impossible to list every time he's verbally abused someone or made some threats, but some notable events are:

* Received a phone call in 2013 from my mom saying she and my dad were locked in their bedroom and he was trying to break the door down to get to them.
* Headbutt me sometime around 2012 to make me fight him when I was angry with him for being high and incoherently rambling to me.
* Several instances with my other brother where they got into fist-fights because he was acting belligerent and insulting my mom, and he didn't appreciate being confronted.
* Ex-friend of my brother confided this year that my brother told him he would kill my dad if my dad did not keep paying my brothers truck payments.
* I already mentioned he recently attacked a good Samaritan and police officer this year.
* Not an aggressive act, but several times he's gone schizophrenic and claimed crazy things like our nephews were inside his washing machine and sobbing that he couldn't get them out. This particular incident was around 2008 or 2009 and we later found out he mixed his methadone with other pills that caused him to hallucinate.

When he's not being hotheaded and looking to start a fight with someone, he generally is so doped out that he could pass out and fall asleep in the middle of the kitchen floor or just sleeping in his room. When he sleeps is when everyone can escape the insanity for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I know some responses will be tempted to provide drug addiction help, but please try to keep in mind my family's priority is to keep my dad safe first. If my brother can be helped, then that's great, but we've all given him literally every chance to redeem himself, get help, etc  and I don't want my dad to live with him another minute if possible. He has proven time after time that he does not want any help. He is overflowing with confidence and actually thinks very highly of himself. He's convinced himself that he is superior in every way and any misfortune he's had is just the world pushing down good people.

We keep hoping he'll get arrested again and go away for an actual long time, but somehow the longest he's ever stayed in jail was a little over a year. He's a good faker when he knows he needs to be, so he knows how to fool people into thinking he's ""functional"" enough. First impression of him from the perspective of a complete stranger, and you'd just think he's a really strange guy who seems kinda toxic, but doesn't technically cross any lines.

This has been the most frustrating part. What he's doing should be illegal, but the police don't seem to care that an abusive family member can intimidate his way into being a lifelong leech on his own father. Please, please let us know if there's some program or anything out there that can help us out.

Here‚Äôs some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary ‚Äúpromising to give away my unborn child‚Äù. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he‚Äôd give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass.

Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he‚Äôs an absent parent)

Here‚Äôs another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I‚Äôd consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn‚Äôt want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I‚Äôd be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should‚Äôve asked permission first.

domesticviolence,"Perhaps the least emotionally charged exchange we have ever shared between the two of us. For nearly two years now I have been buried beneath the insecurity and jealousy that had consumed me after my boyfriend had beat me outdoors in broad daylight. I‚Äôve been on here a handful of times looking for strength and support only to wake up the next morning and call him myself. 

The jealousy comes from knowing that in his previous relationship he had never laid a hand on her. I would consistently pry as you why he was able to hurt me but not his ex. I feel like an evil person almost wishing that it had been something all his exes were exposed to, but deep down if there is any clarity or sense left in my brain I am thankful that harm never came to her - it just makes me feel as if there is something I had done to deserve it.

Not because he had hurt me again but because as time continued I noticed that I became more resentful that he was now treating me kindly with respect and tenderness AFTER completely burning all of the bridges from him to my family/friends and hurting me.

We got into an argument and in the middle of it, he gets in my face and yells ‚Äúdo you want me to hit you?‚Äù I think it was the adrenaline because I said ‚Äúdo it and I‚Äôll call my family and 911.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt even make sense because my family is on the other side of the country. Yet it was the only thing I could think of. He then got his phone to record me. I said ‚Äúmy husband just threatened to hit me and I told him I‚Äôll call 911 if he does.‚Äù He stopped recording after that. Eventually, I just started sobbing and it hit me that my husband threatened to hit me. I told him and he blamed me. He said I was blocking him (I honestly don‚Äôt remember doing that but he can easily push me aside if I was) and that I had spittle coming out of my mouth.

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone, throwaway obviously because my abuser stalks both my main and alt accounts.

After 5 years together, and 4+ years of dealing with physical, emotional, and financial abuse, I am done. I have made a plan to move in with my cousin. Her and my best friend are the only two who have any idea what is going on in my relationship. Our lease begins the first week of July, and my god am i ready for my freedom.

Funnily enough (in a very morbid way) after I came back from the hospital today so get a sling around my arm because he tore my shoulder muscle from slamming me to the ground the other day, I got the call. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made the deposit, we move in the first week of July‚Äù I cried right there on the sidewalk. After years of abuse I‚Äôm going to be free.

My escape plan however, needs the kinks worked out. Due to the current world situation, im currently unemployed and he is working from home. I planned to leave and take my animals (all registered under my name and my name alone) when he was gone, but i now have no idea when that will happen. He has random parts hanging around the house that he‚Äôs trying to sell, i was honestly considering hiring someone in the ny/nj area to buy the part off of him and offer extra for him to drive to ship it to them so i can make my escape while he is gone. I‚Äôve also contacted my bank to remove myself as an authorized used on our shared cc. Also our lease was up last year and we have been paying month to month so no problems there as well.

I know there is so much more that I need to do before leaving but I just want to make sure I do everything I can to keep him from finding me because I legitimately think he‚Äôll try to kill me when he finds out. My dad is still paying for my phone while im in college so my abuser has no access to the account. I plan to change my phone number as well and tell all my fanily not to respond to any of his attempts to contact them.

Another issue is that we also go to the same university, we are both set to graduate next year. But since I am going through with this I wouldn‚Äôt feel safe at my university and plan on taking the year off. Not only for safety, but I‚Äôm going to need some serious mental health guidance after this, my grades are already in the toilet because of it so I need a break.

Other than the shared card, there‚Äôs no other money I owe him or have tied up with him anywhere.

domesticviolence,"So I cannot have a conversation with my ex. Every time we talk - he insults me. I have been nothing but politically correct, keeping the conversation neutral. 

He calls me disgusting, manipulative, evil, awful. Yesterday he called me gross on 3 occasions because I attempted to put up a boundary. 

Does this reflect badly on him? Or can he just get away with this? Will a judge not care? It feels really unfair that he would just be able to call me names in every single interaction and not have any consequence. 

I then question why I can‚Äôt insult him back, you know? That would feel more fair. Right now he‚Äôs just walking all over me with insults. Coming and going as he pleases and beating my ego to a pulp. 

Example: ‚Äúhow are the kids doing? I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to give me any real information though, because you‚Äôre a piece of shit and awful person. But I‚Äôm wondering if they can talk on the phone?‚Äù

domesticviolence,"Hi,

I will first provide information about the urgent situation, and provide background information further down in the post.

I currently live in the US. My dad and mom live in Singapore with my younger brother who is in high school. My Dad has been abusive towards my mother for a long time; mostly emotionally and verbally, but has recently been physically abusive as well. My dad recently sold our house in Singapore, and put half the money from the sale into my mom's account, and my family has moved apartments a few times since.

Today he sent her a message saying that she had to transfer all the money to his account by the end of the day, and to send him her bank statements since Jan 2020. There was no explicit threat, but it is strongly implied by the history of abuse. My mom has reached out to a counsellor, who said that she needs to come in to the office in person to register for a case worker. My mom is afraid that if my dad finds out she's reached out to a counsellor, he will get violent. She is currently working from home, so is locked in her room and cannot leave until evening, after work, which is after the counsellor's office closes. We're afraid of what might happen at the end of the day if she's still at home and hasn't transferred the money (which she doesn't want to do for reasons explained below). She has reached out to the counsellor about the situation, but has not yet received a response.

She can go to my uncle's (mom's brother) house, which is where she's gone when things have gotten bad in the past. But she usually views this as a last-resort option as she doesn't like to burden her brother. She also doesn't usually leave the house during the day, so if she checks out of work and leaves to go to the counsellor's office, my dad will know something is up, and my mom doesn't like to leave my brother alone with him when he's angry.

What is the best course of action here? I understand that the laws in Singapore may be different from the laws in the US or wherever you're from, but any advice or insight is appreciated. I personally have no idea what to tell her, and feel guilty that I don't know what to do.

P.S. I have crossposted this to other subs. Please let me know if there is anywhere else I can post this to get some advice

\------

In the current apartment, my mom's monthly salary is equal to the monthly rent. My dad makes 4 times what my mom does (because she took many years off work to raise my brother and me, and is now above the age of 50). My dad refused to pay for the rent a couple of months last year. When my mom explains that she cannot cover the rent herself because she does not earn enough, he because EXTREMELY vile and abusive, and sometimes physically so. He calls her a leech (among other things), and asks her why she can't just go earn more. He also refuses to pay for anything else except for my brother's school tuition, but the rent is the biggest burden on my mom.

My mom thinks he is doing this to wipe out all of the money in her account, which would allow him to control her completely. She doesn't want to let go of it because it's all she has, and doesn't want to live with my dad after my brother graduates high school (also we don't know if he's going to pay for my brother's college. I'm a PhD student so I don't make nearly enough to support anyone).

In January of this year, my dad agreed to pay the 80% of the rent. He did so until March, and has not paid rent since. My mom only found out about this a couple of days ago from our landlord. She confronted him about this, but he again became abusive. The lease in solely in my mom's name. She has paid the rent for April, May, and June, but the money in her account is starting to drop very fast.

My dad is very weird about money. He's always trying some pseudo get-rich-quick scheme like property flipping or options trading, but he's lost a lot of money on these ventures because he has no idea what he's doing. When he gets stressed about money, he becomes abusive. He is also an alcoholic, and becomes more abusive when he's drunk. My mom is very afraid of my dad, especially when he's angry and **especially** when he's drunk. My 14 year-old brother once had to push my dad away from my mom when he was drunk and abusing her physically. She spends most of the time at home locked in her room, and this is exacerbated by the current lockdown.

My mom is reluctant to call the cops on him because she thinks it will negatively affect my brother's life, and she thinks keeping the family unit together even if only in name is worth the trauma. We are also reluctant to call the cops on him because my mom does not make enough money to afford to pay for an apartment and my brother's tuition, and still have enough money to send him to college. My aforementioned uncle is semi-wealthy and has been very generous with lending us money when we've needed it in the past, so I'm sure he will at least help, but my mom doesn't want to burden him. My uncle is the only other family we have in Singapore because we are originally from India.

I'm not sure how much evidence we have against him. I (and hopefully my brother) will vehemently testify against him about the abuse, and so will my uncle. My mother probably has chat logs of abuse on Whatsapp. I've asked her to download a voice recording app, and start recording when she thinks he is going to get abusive. I have screenshots of some of his browsing history, which is not great viewing but probably not illegal. He also tried to cheat on my mom in the past with someone from Canada (probably a catfish), and some of our extended family know about that. We have a lot of testimony against him, but not much concrete evidence of the abuse.",Dad is threatening my Mom if she doesn't transfer all her money to him today,frowaway181,2020-06-09 05:00:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gzgcqw/dad_is_threatening_my_mom_if_she_doesnt_transfer/,1,0.76,2,15,1073

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôm currently in a relationship and we‚Äôve been going for 5 years. This is my first and only boyfriend in my 25 years of life. In the beginning everything was beautiful and I felt so loved but then things changed. A year and a half into the relationship I found out my bf would masturbate to pictures of his girl best friends and even to pictures of his sister in laws. I asked him to stop since he was so close to them and even asked him to stop hanging out with them if he saw them in any way other then as friends. He told me he felt nothing for them and what he was doing was normal and had no emotional connection. He said he didn‚Äôt even want to have real sex with them. I began to get jealous and insecure so I would check his phone often and realized he continued to do it. I didn‚Äôt leave him because that was my first bf and felt like I loved him. One day he got annoyed that I kept asking him to unfriend them on social media and screamed at me saying ‚Äúyou get your feelings hurt because you want to. I‚Äôm going to keep doing this and it‚Äôs your fault if your feelings get hurt.‚Äù I should‚Äôve taken that as a sign and left. 

As time went by my jealousy would get worse and my confidence levels no longer existed. I became so needy to the point where I would ask what he was doing all the time and he got fed up and slapped me. Again, I didn‚Äôt take that as a sign cause I loved him. 

In November 2018 my mom kicked me out of the house because I got into an argument with one of her sisters. Of course she took their side and I was out on the streets. I lived in my car for a few days since I have no other family and occasionally my bf would sneak me into his house. I had a job but I had just started so I didn‚Äôt have money for my own place. His mom let me stay there for the remainder of the year until I was able to find my own please. I ended up getting pregnant and I told him about it...his reaction was to get mad, slap me, grab me by the hair and tell me I was stupid for not taking care of myself. He said he was too young to end his life and he didn‚Äôt want anything of it. 

January 2nd 2019 he forced me to get an abortion. I was afraid to live on the streets again and had nowhere to go so I remained in his house. I said I wasn‚Äôt going to get an abortion and that I could keep the baby and take care of it myself and he wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it. He continued to beat me and said if I didn‚Äôt go thru with the abortion he‚Äôd beat it out of me. I passed out in the waiting room of the abortion clinic because I was so scared and didn‚Äôt want to go through with it. One of the nurses took me to the back and gave me some Coca Cola to help my blood pressure levels. I remember crying so much and not being able to tell her why. When I heard the little heart beat I couldn‚Äôt contain myself yet I was so afraid. I was 8 weeks. The 2nd visit I had to speak to a counselor before the procedure and I was hoping she‚Äôd ask me if it was my choice and if I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to hear her say that if it was against my will she could help. She didn‚Äôt. Instead she explained the procedure and showed me how it would work with a little model on her desk. I was so afraid about many things yet I did nothing about it. I was sedated via an IV and given Valium. I remember waking up crying so much because I knew it was over and my baby was gone. I was heavily sedated but I remember feeling my shirt was drenched in tears and the nurse had to walk me out to the car where my bf was waiting. She told him I was heavily sedated and that I wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. She said he had to make sure I ate and comfort me. I cried the whole way home and pretty much the whole day. I hated myself and still do. Till this day I hate myself more than him because I didn‚Äôt do anything to stop this. I was alone and couldn‚Äôt tell anyone other then him what was happening to me. I had no place to go other than his house. 

As time went by things changed. He became nicer, the beatings stop for a little bit until he moved in with me to my new place. When we get into serious arguments he tends to pull my hair or push me or punch me in the face. I‚Äôve wanted to report him to the cops several times but he never leaves any signs. He‚Äôs also verbally abusive and emotionally. I‚Äôve never bled, he hasn‚Äôt left any noticeable bruises and he‚Äôs never pulled hair out of my head to show as evidence. I feel like if I say anything they won‚Äôt believe me and it will make things worse when he comes back home. 

I also looked up domestic violence signs and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll charge me for domestic violence since I would check his phone without permission and invade his privacy in social media. I don‚Äôt want to go to jail. I never called him names and never laid a hand on him not even in self defense. 

I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long but I just had to vent. Can anyone help me or guide me? Please don‚Äôt be harsh with me in regards to the abortion or all the things I‚Äôm allowing him to do.

She was trying to get in contact me later when I got my first kid. She was nice, but nosy. My partner suspected she was talking in neighborhood about him abusing me.

This is also the first time I'm posting something on reddit but I'm completely lost and I don't know what else to do.
I was visiting a childhood friend today. We haven't seen each other in a year and decided to have a small party/gathering with some friends at his place. His parents were away for the evening and would come back later that evening. Since he lives quite far away, he invited me to stay over night and go home the next day. 
After the party we went upstairs to his room and watched a movie. His father was downstairs in the living room watching tv and his mom went to sleep in the room next to us.
At some point late that night, we heard some glass breaking downstairs. We thought his father might have dropped a plate or something, so we didn't go to check on him. However, mom woke up and went downstairs to see what happened. 
They had a short argument and then she started screaming and called for my friend. He went to the living room and I stayed in his room. I heard his mom yell that he (his dad) hit her in the face. She stormed off and locked herself in her room. My friend cleaned up the mess downstairs and came back upstairs and didn't say a word for the rest of the night. We finished the movie and I went to bed in another room upstairs.

My parents divorced because of domestic violence when I was little and it broke my family and I can't stand the thought of it happening again to my friends family. I love them very much and they seemed to be the perfect family.
Should I try to talk to them in the morning?
Please help me.

UPDATE: I woke up my friend at 5 AM and we had a long talk. He told me it only happened once before and that was a long time ago. And it only happens if his father drinks too much. I know his father very well and it sounded like the truth to me.
He is a very reasonable and intelligent man and I have (had) the utmost respect for him.
So I decided to go downstairs and wake him up. He was very hung over and said he couldn't remember anything. I told him what happened and he reacted in disbelief and was shocked. I made it clear that his actions were unacceptable and that I was thinking about calling the cops. But since he was back to his old self, I proposed to sit down at the kitchen table and to discuss how to deal with this. We talked for an hour about health issues and self control with alcohol and other things. His wife and son joined us later and we decided it would be the best for them to get professional help and counseling. He was very apologetic and his wife made it very clear that if it would happen again, she would leave him. 
Before I left he promised me, to never do it again. 
I also told the mother to call me whenever she feels unsafe or just wants to talk about it. 
I am now on my way home and it's almost 08:30 AM. I am dead tired and I'll need a couple of days to process the whole situation. 

Thanks for the help and advise (which I didn't really follow, sorry for that). I was just really freaking out and needed to talk to someone,  because I was never in a situation like this before.

Also sorry for any spelling mistakes, english is my third language and I'm still learning.

I just wish I would have acted differently.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôm new to reddit, but I truly feel so alone and genuinely have no idea who to talk to or what to do. My bf (25) and I (25f) were driving home from a birthday party tonight and he asked me why I was in a bad mood. I started responding by saying I felt like he left me during the party and practically acts like we don‚Äôt know each other while interacting with everyone else, especially girls. I told him it hurts my feelings and he told me I have a mouth I should use it if I want to feel included. Which I did! I was talking to people, but I just felt like (and this is how I usually feel in groups with him) that he was specifically ignoring me, like wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. And I didn‚Äôt want to be that annoying girlfriend who can‚Äôt make her own friends or needs to be babysat at a party which I‚Äôm not, I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable about wanting him to acknowledge me more even with just a touch or a little consideration while we‚Äôre out and hanging with people. But I probably shouldn‚Äôt have brought it up because he had been drinking pretty heavily and was already upset about some information he found out earlier in the night. So anyway I get done telling him how I feel and the fight starts escalating to him screaming at me and then I start screaming back and then while we‚Äôre stopped at a stop light he starts choking me for about 10-15 seconds I think, I‚Äôm not sure how long it was because I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I was terrified. I threw the car in park and ran out onto the sidewalk as far away as I could. He then got in the drivers seat and then drove off. I called his sister to pick me up and when I got home he apologized, but I told him I wanted him to go. He then proceeded to tell me that the months of couples therapy that we have been in has all been a lie and we should be honest that our relationship is shit. I ask him to leave again and he goes. He then calls me about 30 minutes later apologizing and saying he was just angry at me and he‚Äôs very sorry for being physical and that he only said the hurtful thing about couples therapy because he was very upset and he didn‚Äôt mean it at all, he just wanted to say something to hurt me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm so confused. I love him and we live together and have always planned on eventually getting married. He definitely has a bad temper and has been very disrespectful in the past, like telling me to shut the fuck up when I tell him how I feel etc. but I can‚Äôt help thinking I‚Äôm just miserable to be around and I‚Äôm very selfish and can only talk about me and how things make ME feel, which is why he‚Äôs constantly pissed off when I bring things up and why he got physical tonight. I truly never thought this would happen and I thought our relationship was on the mend.

domesticviolence,"My boyfriend has a temper, he gets in a mood where he gets mad often and then he will start casually calling me a bitch and making passive aggressive comments. Two years ago he stole my phone out of my hands to read what I was saying to my friend. I was talking to her because he‚Äôd said he hates my voice and my face, I‚Äôm annoying and he wants me to go away. He also threw me on the floor that time. 

About a year ago we had a fight in the restaurant we worked at and he called me a fucking bitch shouted go fuck yourself in front of everyone and stormed out. We didn‚Äôt speak for three months and he was angry all that time. Eventually I‚Äôd left my bag in the restaurant overnight and he came in one morning screaming about how much he hates me and dumped my stuff into the toilet. 

After that he sincerely apologised for being so crazy and we became friends. After many months we got back together, now we are living together with his dad in the country because our restaurant closed down and we lost our jobs. Yesterday he got angry and I tried to get him to talk to me, he kneed me in the face threw me on the ground and punched me. I said I‚Äôm definitely leaving and organised my friend to come and get me when it‚Äôs the right time. 

Then he talked to me about it, at first he said it was my fault, id wanted him to hit me and taunted him. I said that‚Äôs not what happened and eventually he was sorry and said he would not do it again. But when I asked him what he would do instead or how he was going to work on it he got angry again and said I should work on my social issues like ‚Äúnot knowing when to shut up‚Äù. I said I need time to get over it and later on decided to make the peace. 

I KNOW that literally everything in this situation points to that I should leave because he‚Äôs going to do it again, he blames me for it and thinks I deserve it, and isn‚Äôt going to even try to change. I am basically ready to go and can call my friend at any time. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to. Does anyone know what‚Äôs going on? Do I want to stay? Has anyone else felt like this?

domesticviolence,"I need help and I can't imagine I'm the only one who's ever found the documentation process challenging, so if anyone has ANY advice on the following I would be so so grateful for your insight &lt;3

1) I've done my best to document my ex partner's abuse over the past 3 years as best I could (still things I wish I'd done, but even so, I have a LOT) - thousands of highly abusive text messages, video recordings, voice messages, paperwork on the 7 times he's been institutionalized (yes, seven). I finally reached my limit with his abusive texts and INCESSANT calling and went full no contact about three months ago. But a few days ago I realized he'd been driving past my house /parking there etc. and Im terrified. My attorney said the best move forward is to file for a stalking protection order, which is great because I'm tired of living in fear, but it also means that I have no fewer than 14 days to get all of this evidence I've collected together for the hearing.

2) I've been working to build a timeline / narrative / documentation with exhibits for MONTHS and I'm still nowhere near close to being done. It's super triggering and as a single mom of a toddler, it's not like I have tons of time on my hands. I work full time. I give my daughter 110% of my fully engaged self, and then I have to sit down and go through all this stuff after I put her to bed and clean the house. 

How does anyone manage to do all of this? I feel like I'm trying to drink water from a firehose. I can't risk not providing the courts all of the information to show how truly unsafe he is but I'm also not a machine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to organize thousands of text messages/videos quickly (and in a way that would be accepted by a court?). I've downloaded apps, paid for software, but I'm still drowning in this process. 

Teach me your survival stories. There's got to be something that I'm not doing right (or just not doing at all) because I simply can't imagine that any person, especially a person who is suffering from PTSD due to extreme abuse, can just pull all this together at the drop of a hat.

domesticviolence,"hello all I have a 3 year restraining order against my childrens father due to physical abuse and stalking (also have sole physical and legal custody of children). Stalking was so bad I moved out of town 1 year ago. Yesterday I got a message request from a burner account of his telling me he worked for UPS and knows my address, even went as far as to tell me where I was -city wise- . Said hes opening up a new case on me to get the kids back and that I need to stop ""running from him"". Spooked me very much considering the circumstances, so I reported it. Cop came out and saw my evidence and screen recording etc, said ""alright this looks good to me, let me take your order and get pictures of it in my car"" when he came back he said the order was popping up in his system as ""not served"" therefore charges couldnt be pressed on their behalf.  I called the city I'd fled from and had the civil rights rep email me my court transcripts that prove he was present at our last court date in August 2019 in attempt to modify the restraining &amp; custody order (it was denied). At the end of the 2019 court transcript, it reads ""Restraining Order(s) heretofore made to remain in effect"" I called police back in current city to ask if someone could take my report now that I had this information, someone took it and forwarded it to the DA. Very solid evidence. The officer just said they may run into an obstacle with the fact that it says ""not served"" in their system when it comes to the DA. I just made the report friday, at the August 2019 court date I presented evidence that he was still a threat and it wasnt addressed at all, so I have thin faith going into this and feel like this just may jeopardize my children and I and anger the restrained party more, especially if nothing will be done.

domesticviolence,"She was sweet to me.

God, was she charming. She swept me off my feet the moment we met, I don't usually fall for people 

but she had everything I liked. She was tall (6ft) and butch and I was smitten by her protectiveness and how she treated me. 

She bought me dinners (I never paid for a single thing, she wouldn't let me pay or even tip myself), jewelry, clothes, took me out, just all that kind of stuff. It was a first to me to have someone treat me so... I don't know like I was special. She made me feel special. It was ok at first. 

Then at home one day she's talking about work, complaining about something, and I made a sarcastic quip about the situation. Don't even remember what I said, next thing I know I'm holding onto the side of my face because she's smacked me across my cheek. I just kinda sat there shocked and asked 

if she really just hit me, she said she didn't mean to hit me that hard. I didn't know what to do so I just said it was ok, it was a mistake and a one time thing, we went to bed. 

My life changed after that night. She became demanding, scary, intimidating. I'm 5'3 140lbs, she was 6' and little over 300lbs, so she constantly used her large frame to back me into corners while berating me over something I said or did, restraining me if I ever tried to get away, pinning me against walls to show she was stronger than I was. Stuff like that. 

One bad night we went to a bar, I went to the patio to smoke and another woman followed me and started hitting on me, asking to buy me another drink. I was explaining I was here with someone when my girlfriend walked out and flipped the fuck out. She walked over and I guess her look or something sent the other woman scurrying away, while I began to be yelled at about being a lying, cheating whore (the usual go to). 

I was tired that night so I got up and walked away, out of the bar while figuring out how the fuck I was going to get home. She of course followed me, and I blame myself for letting her pull me into an alley. I should have stayed in view of other people. Well she screamed at me some more, wouldn't 

stop grabbing me and she finally pushed too hard and I stumbled backwards and smashed my face into the cement wall and suddenly I found myself spitting out one of my teeth as it was cracked and broken by the impact. 

I still fucking stayed. I started crying and she hugged me and apologized, we went home and I just laid in bed while she did whatever she wanted to me and waited for her to be done and fall asleep so I could just cry into my pillow. 

It became all the time. The hits became routine. Around her friends (I was not allowed to speak to my friends cause the me being a whore and all) she would make fun of me for being mentally ill, that I was so stupid I had to drop out of college, she had to take care of me, ect ect. If I said something she didn't like she'd pinch me and twist (like sitting at the table she could pretend to pat my thigh while really she was punishing me for what I said). 

She quickly learned the key was not to hit me in the face or choke me because that leaves bruises where people could see. So my chest/ribs, lower back, and legs were all fair game. 

I never realized others noticed when I was once again explaining walking awkwardly because I fell (again), or ran into a door (again), or slipped in the shower. The excuses were bullshit to everyone but they whispered to each other never asked if I was ok. 

She convinced me to get off my meds for my bipolar disorder. She told me she liked me manic 

because I was better in bed. So I stopped, my depression became worse, I was becoming more isolated and had no one to talk to, and my anxiety was at it's worst in my life.

But I didn't tell anyone what was going on. I felt like I deserved it. I hated myself, so it seemed fitting to be hit and degraded since I was so self loathing. 

Then someone did reach out. 

I got a text from an unknown person, asking if she had the right number. I said yes, who is this? 

They wouldn't tell me who they were, just they were friends with my girlfriend and they thought something was going on. She or he told me they had been in an abusive relationship in the past and every time they saw me with my partner they could see something was up. They also informed me she was making fun of me (like were teenagers not in our mid 20's) to her group of friends. 

Apparently, she would mock my depression and said I was nasty, that I threatened to kill myself if she left me, that I pulled out my hair, cut myself for attention, discussed our bedroom activities and showed pictures I had sent her sexting in the past. 

I was humiliated. But it was the last straw, I don't know what clicked but I realized I needed to get the fuck out, this needed to end now. 

So while she was at work I gathered all my things and left, went back to my parents home, and just sat in one of the bedrooms crying for hours and throwing up because I was terrified she was going to come after me. She sent me some vile texts and I eventually had to block her on everything as she was harassing the fuck out of me. 

The things I trusted her enough to tell her, like being raped as a child, was all used against me. She told anyone who would listen the things I told her in confidence. But I wasn't mad, I was numb. So what? I asked myself, I could easily disprove or correct the things she was saying so I thought screw her. 

I told my psych what had been going on and he was very supportive, told me I was worth more than someone abusing me, I didn't deserve it, he was just really nice about it. He didn't make me feel like it was my fault and that felt good. Hell, it just felt good telling someone what had been going on since I had bottled it up for over a year.

I'm back on meds now and in a lot better place than I was just three months ago. I'm working on coping with substance abuse (being drunk made being hit not hurt as badly, and I preferred being able to pass out while she used my body how she wanted in bed) and it's a struggle but without being abused and scared all the time I think I might be able to work on that now. 

I know this was a long rambling rant but I just am so bewildered why I put up with the abuse for so 

long. I'm a victims advocate, I've helped others escape abuse from partners (it's really rampant in the 

LGBT community, just not talked about as much), but I couldn't leave myself because she broke me 

down. I still think sometimes it all happened to another person, as I don't know who that person was 

who was playing the victim role.

I don't know where this is going so I'm going to end this here. Thanks for listening/reading. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to see red flags before it gets too bad? This is now the second partner in my life who has turned abusive, although this one was the worst by far, but I really feel like I am to blame since this keeps happening.

domesticviolence,"I posted this in r/mentalHealth but I thought posting here might garner more specific responses

This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor, but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident, so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"". I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I have a really hard time dealing with her and she ruins a lot of my days. I wish I knew how to prevent her from doing this to me. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this.

However, after educating herself further and in light of all that is happening right now regarding police violence and murder against Black people, she does not feel right filing for a second restraining order or reporting him to the police, or involving them at all in the matter. At the same time, she is afraid for her life and believes that he would kill her given the opportunity. I am really at a loss for what to say or how to help and despite my readings on the subject of abolition; I have no idea how to help her stay safe in the immediate present and am not sure what advice to give or what direction to point her in.

domesticviolence,"I totally know my relationship is all wrong and pretty toxic. I've never been even particularly angry with a SO until I met my current one. We have been together about 4 years. 
This is a throwaway and I'll change small insignificant details to keep myself safe.

He is a little older than me but really immature. Hes so angry, all the time. The smallest things, an argument over me dropping a tiny bit of food can end up in him threatening to throw furniture at me.
I know its totally wrong. We bought a new house recently and I've had food and drink thrown over me, totally humiliating although it doesn't hurt.

I'm a stay at home worker with the stuff thats going on at the minute. He's not. I clean daily, cook everything including his meals for the night shifts he works.

But he says I do nothing. Just accuses me daily of playing on the Xbox all day (I definitely do not. 1 hour at most, or not at all). 

I'm feisty too and not one to take loads of abuse but it gets so out of hand and he either threatens me, throws things at me or breaks stuff and has hurt me before. He once pulled me round the garden by my hair and I lost chunks of it. 

So why do I feel no anger once it's done? Why am I so forgiving, and just want to love him and be loved? Cos when things are good they're awesome and about 10 mins after hes finished being like that I just want things to be fine and theres never any hard feelings on my part. I'm totally in love and just want to get on with stuff. Thats not normal is it, but I cant shake it off.

Also sometimes I feel guilty because of things I said or did when retaliating or to protect myself. I once kicked out at him because I was scared and caused a nasty bruise. Thats makes me feel like I cant tell anyone because I've done wrong too.

domesticviolence,"Yesterday I called the police on my neighbours for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. In case it's relevant, I live in the UK.

The first time, I heard lots of loud yelling, screaming, and crying. It was only the woman crying. I could also hear furniture and objects moving around loudly so I called the police. They came and as far as I'm aware, they spoke to the woman (I think the man had left the apartment by the time the police arrived).

Yesterday I heard them fighting again but this time it sounded like the situation had escalated. I definitely heard someone get slapped and based on what I could hear them saying (in Spanish), it was the woman who was slapped. She kept yelling ""respect me! Don't hurt me!"" over and over. It was extremely distressing. Called the police again and within 30 minutes I could see the cop outside my neighbour's building's door. A few minutes later the policeman calls me and says nobody is opening the door but 3 second later he says ""nevermind, someone's opened up"" and that was that/

This morning the police calls me again and says that they couldn't find the apartment yesterday. They went to the right address but couldn't find the right apartment within the building. There are max 3 apartments/flats in that building so I find this really surprising. The police said they will try and find them again today but I find it so strange that they couldn't find the apartment because 2 weeks ago they could. It's like the police aren't making a note of these things.

Anyway, I'm just wondering... is there anything else I can do in this situation to help? I've already recorded a couple of their fights on voice notes (the police seem to have no interest in this) and called the police twice. But if I keep hearing this woman getting abused, is there anything else I can do? Do I just keep calling the police? I fear for her safety and not to make this about me but it's extremely distressing to overhear domestic violence and feel like there's nothing I can do to help. The couple that I hear fighting speak Spanish and so do I... not sure if that's relevant but thought I'd mention it. I don't know this couple personally and I haven't even seen them. I just know they live in the building next to mine.

domesticviolence,"I have been in lockdown with a housemate ('Alex') for over 2 months now. Alex has been having really loud arguments with their partner ('Taylor'), has been screaming at them, crying, shouting abuse at them, and often throws things. They have since taken a 'relationship break' - Alex and Taylor are still talking but are not broaching emotional topics that could lead to arguments or having sexual discussions. They agreed that they are no longer 'dating' but may revisit a relationship once they can see each other in person again, but also provided some caveats that Alex work on their emotional regulation and Taylor work on their communication.

Alex had been listening to love songs on repeat, looking through old photos, and hasn't been doing any of the work they promised to do on their emotions. They have stated that they can't help their trauma or what triggers them, and they believe that allowances should be made for them. Alex asked for my advice, and I gave it honestly - saying that relationships require compromise and triggers (while valid) can sometimes be irrational. Alex told me that one of their triggers was being controlled, which means they can never compromise. I agreed that controlling behaviour isn't good in a relationship. But I added that if a friend asks you to change something that upsets them, and it doesn't cause too much of an issue for you, it makes sense to try and change that for that friend. (Thinking in my head that Taylor has asked Alex to stop referring to them as derogatory names such as 'b*tch', 'd*ck', and others which are too offensive to type here.) Alex appeared to agree with me and even did some work and chatted to their therapist about it (over video chat).

A few days ago, Alex had a friend sitting outside on the street and we were all having socially distanced drinks. Alex got a bit drunk (on second drink?) and interrupted Alex's friend mid-sentence to shout at me: ""We need to stop this narrative that Alex can't have healthy relationships!"" (Yes referring to themselves in the 3rd person is common.)

It came out of nowhere. I was in the middle of paying for dinner which Alex had chosen and been all to happy to have me pay for.

Me: ""I'm sorry what are you talking about?""

Alex: ""You saying that I can never have healthy relationships is hurtful and unhelpful and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""I never said that you couldn't-""

Alex: ""I don't care. That's what it felt like and it hurts and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""But I never said that and I don't think that. I just said compromise is needed in a relationship. I am not validating what you think I said when I didn't say that and don't think that at all.""

Alex: ""I DON'T CARE!!!! YOU NEED TO STOP!!""

Alex's friend interrupts this and says that we shouldn't have this conversation while drunk. Alex takes a while to calm down but then talks to their friend while I'm sat feeling really afraid and still ordering and paying for dinner.

Alex's friend leaves and Alex goes upstairs and starts shouting on the phone to someone upstairs.

I'm quite afraid because Alex has thrown things at me and 'play hit' me a few times when frustrated (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). I had a serious chat with Alex every single time and they keep pushing the boundary, like throwing things at the wall next to my head instead of at me. I've seen how loud and shouty Alex can get while upset, and I know it won't hurt me physically but I don't want to be screamed at or have things thrown at me. I also am concerned that Alex thinks that how what people say makes them feel matters more than what they said (this was a common theme with their arguments with Taylor too) so if I do try and talk about it Alex might not understand what I'm saying or get really really angry at me.

It escalated today. I spoke to my sister at 3pm in my closet in my bedroom and Alex apparently overheard? I've been sat in the living room all evening working on my laptop, when I went in the next room to take a call from my other sister.

Alex messaged me: Hey gal, if you‚Äôre going to have calls about me you‚Äôll need to either go elsewhere to have them or keep your voice down And also if you need to move out then go ahead

Me: I'm talking about graduation photos?

Alex: Earlier you weren't.  I don‚Äôt know or care what you‚Äôre talking about now

Me: Okay

Alex:  But earlier really upset me, and instead of stewing I‚Äôm going to tell you  And tell you in future not to say hurtful things so loudly 

Me: I'm actually good thanks. Cool will do.

Alex: *thumbs up*

It turns out that Alex asked Taylor if anyone would have reason to be scared of Alex getting violent when angry or upset and Taylor had to remind Alex that Taylor had been hit, slapped, and had things thrown at them when Alex was upset. But that doesn't seem to be the answer Alex was looking for.

domesticviolence,"My gf &amp; mother have just had their whole lives uprooted and forced to move across country to get away from her abusive brother after he attempted to kill himself. 

He was emotionally, physically, financially and spiritually abusive towards both of them from a young age (12, he is now 20). He suffers from being bipolar, manic depressive which often result mood swings and violent outbursts and also addiction issues with drugs and alcohol. 

Late last year they were both forced to kick him out of their home and put a restraining order on him after one of his outbursts, where he pushed my SO through the conservatory door, nearly bringing the door down on top of her. He had at that point also punched several holes in the plasterboard of their home and threatened both her and her mother physically and self-harmed i89with a piece of glass in front of them. It got to the point where the police were called and he had to be arrested and detained for 24 hours. 

I also am aware that whilst living with them, he stole from his mother and her continuously and was very controlling around his mothers comings and going.

This isn't the only outburst there has been where something like this has happened and not the first time he has made an attempt on his life. 

I don't know if its worth mentioning but the father has never really been around. Their mother and he divorced when my gf and her brother were very young and never really made an effort to be in their lives afterwards, only seeing them every few months, turning up drunk, or leaving them alone to go to the pub, drug addictions, and generally just being a spiteful and mean person, etc.

Im trying to be there for both of them as best as i can but I've never had this conversation before and know very little about the topic. I've done some research myself already but there's so much out there that i don't know where to begin. Could anyone send me some links to useful articles or sites or ted talks?

domesticviolence,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old living in a house with two parents, a sister, and a dog., United States

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

domesticviolence,"I am F20 and live with my two parents who are highly emotionally manipulative and toxic to each other. I'm in a situation where from the time I was born up until I was around 16, my dad was heavily physically abusive to me, my mom, and my little brother. When I say that, I mean fits that lasted upwards of three to six hours where he would throw all of us against walls, grab our jaws so hard that it hurt to eat for several days, pull our hair, throw us on the floor and kick us, tackle us to the floor, jump on top of us and scream and spit in our face, and at times, beat our bodies with his fists. I was constantly hiding bruises at school, I remember at least one occasion where my mom hid her black eye with sunglasses from the repairman fixing our sink, and oftentimes I the abuse was so heavy I thought my dad might not realize his own strength and would accidentally kill me. I lived in constant terror.

As you can imagine, I was heavily traumatized as a kid. To make matters worse, my parents also raised me in an extremely strict religious cult, and because of the rules (particularly regarding clothing &amp; appearance), I was heavily mocked, bullied, and rejected at school and nearly every other social situation I have ever been in. When I was 12, my parents pulled me out of school because I was cutting myself (I didn't do this for attention; I did it on my thighs, which were covered at all times even in the summer due to the dress code rules, but my mom walked in on me changing), and they thought the bullying was the cause of it. Basically, they homeschooled me, except they both worked full time, so I was pretty much left alone in the house, and nearly the only social situation interaction I got until I began college was when I went to the cult church, where most of the people were mean and bullied me.

During my childhood years, my mom took 24 hours a semester and rushed to get 8 yrs of school done in 3.5 yrs, along with several certifications. What I watched her go through was brutal and intense; I watched her have so many meltdowns getting through all that school while raising my brother and I, but she was scared it might get to a point that she would have to flee for our lives, and she was terrified she wouldn't be able to support us. She went from having a few hours at a community college from years ago to being a highly educated professional and working as a controller, and making a decent amount more financially than my dad does. When that happened, she stood up to him and stopped the hours long fits and physical abuse.

Basically, I'm in a situation where the physical abuse and emotional manipulation, the years of isolation, and the bullying have created a cocktail where I'm struggling to be mentally stable, though I've mostly dealt with this by being a perfectionist. I was not educated well during the years I was isolated, however, I was already so far ahead because my parents had high standards and began teaching my brother and I upper level math in elementary, so I was able to get into community college early and didn't struggle with math until I hit pre-cal. I was always made to read a lot, too, so I tended to excel in the non-math courses. As a youth, to cope with my pain, I embraced the fantasy of being perfect, and I ended up doing things like getting up at 4 AM to work out amd teaching myself to speak a second language fluently. However, I struggle with bulimia, it's better now, but it was horrible for years, I have really bad OCD and compulsions, and while I got on Lexapro for the first time in February and it's absolutely changed my life, all the flashbacks and things I'm dealing with still make it really hard to cope.

Anyway, my parents are better now that my dad doesn't physically abuse me, but my parents are still heavily emotionally manipulative and it takes a toll on me. Tonight, they yelled at me for something I never said for five hours; I'm not exaggerating. I begged them that I just wanted to go; I'm always respectful to them. They literally ran around the room, threw things like a chair and a dip machine, my mom threw two iron weights against the floor so hard they broke, they screamed at the top of their lungs, and all of the emotional manipulation and twisted logic was just a lot. Now that I'm on anxiety meds and my boyfriend has come into my life and has actually pointed out bow twisted their logic is and validated my feelings/assured me that their insults to me are unfounded, I cope better, but it still hurts, and tonight left me so exhausted and drained. I cried to the point I was dehydrated. 

But, my problem is, back to my perfectionism, I set my sights on medical school a few years ago because I thought it would give me self worth, but I've actually come to love medicine. I'm going to be a senior after I finish my summer classes, I've gotten through most of the more difficult classes and have a high GPA, and with all the research I've done on GPA, the MCAT, ECs, etc., I genuinely believe I'll be able to get in. My parents are very financially generous, and they're paying for everything, including my education (even though I try to offer to pay for things, they won't let me). My mom is extremely controlling; she called my boss a month after I was fired for something minor where a lot of other employees agreed the boss had it out for me, but it was whatever, and chewed the boss out. That humiliated me. The idea of a parent calling their nearly 21 year old child's boss a month after that child was let go is so inappropriate and embarrassing, but both parents believe that's their right as parents because they pay the bills. My mom found out I lost my virginity last year, and she is mad I haven't apologized to her for that. I lied and said I only had sex with my boyfriend one time and am not sexually active, but she treats my boyfriend like trash now and hates him even though he's an amazing guy, and she loved him before she knew that. She was extremely angry when she found out I was in his bedroom this weekend, even though it was daytime and his parents were right outside in the living room. She questions me on everything, her control exhausts me. I spend several hours a day doing chores, I'm highly responsible, don't drink, smoke, use drugs, etc., am very respectful and don't back talk, but she will not stop seeing me as a child.

So, I have one year left until I'm done with my bachelor's. I'm scared my GPA might drop if I have to work full time while I'm taking classes like O-Chem 2, and I also need to study for the MCAT. The fact that they're paying for everything, and I don't have to pay my own way makes it easier to shadow, research, etc. I'm already on the home stretch, and I know that if by some chance I didn't get into medical school, I'd be stuck with a biology degree I can't do a lot with, and I'd have to give up my dream. I don't know what to do. It sounds silly that I legitimately fear they might beat me again some day. I keep my phone with me, so I can call 911 if that were to happen. I hate having that kind of fear in my own house. But I'm so scared of striking out on my own and not getting in and being screwed.

What would you all do in this situation? Try to hold out and keep a phone close by in case anything happens? I don't think my life is in danger, but I do think I could be decently injured (I don't predict it, but it wouldn't surprise me). They put their hands on me forcefully now, especially my mom, but they don't abuse me. Are there options where I could move out and get into medical school, too? Could I take out loans? My parents have access to my bank account and would take that, my phone, and my car. I'm going to start my own bank account for my next job and hope they don't say anything, but if I were to strike out right now, I'd essentially have nothing to my name.

domesticviolence,"I have been out of the relationship for one whole month. Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

domesticviolence,"Feeling pretty low, thought I'd post.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

domesticviolence,"Hello, I am 21 and am thinking of how to have a conversation with my once physically and emotionally abusive father. This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home. Many nights that felt like a complete nightmare due to his actions.

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

I have a background of child abuse and child sexual abuse and so when he was sincerely apologetic, I forgave him. We have really beautiful highs and terrible lows.

He has hit me many times during arguments, and has left me bruised on countless occassions. I've been choked many times, and once he did it while we were in public and going for a walk. We were arguing over something and he started choking me so hard that i started blacking out. It was dark and there was nobody around except for people in the distance who walked past us and I pretended like nothing was happening.

domesticviolence,"He was always emotionally and verbally abusive. Lots of guilt and shame. Name-calling, blame, threatening, raking out all insecurities and possible triggers. 

And I still married him. Because I loved him. And because he was moving with the military to Europe. And because all attempts at leaving before were unsuccessful. 

So I moved with him. And all my hurt would come out in waves when I couldn't hold it in anymore. That's when he first hurt me by grabbing my arm, holding a hand over my face so I couldn't yell, leaving bruises in innocuous places. Flicking my nose.

""I'm so sorry. I love you so much. You just need to deal with your issues. I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't been freaking out.""

Then he took the first step to hurting me intentionally. He slapped my arm while we were cooking.

""Well you wouldn't shut up.""

Then the escalation. Putting my face between his arm and his hand because I was ""raising my voice."" Fighting him off led to me sitting on the floor where he knelt down, placed a hand around my throat and pushed. And then mocked me when I fought to get my breath back. 

""I love you. Don't leave. We can work through this. You want to stay married right? You promise?""

How could I say no. I was alone, in a foreign country, no family, no real connections yet. We hadn't even been married a year. 

""I'm tired of this petty bullshit. You stupid bitch. Fucking idiot. You're psychotic.""

He loved the mental health angle. He loved using specific words to incite my past struggles. Throwing my fight with self-harm in my face. Never praising that I had come so far and gotten so much better.

Then he finally hit me. And when I wouldn't stop bleeding, that's when he wanted to sit and talk. That's when I needed to calm down.

And I feel guilty. About *everything*. 

I called for help. Got taken away. Taken to the ER. Mandated into unrestricted reporting. Set up with interviews and Victims Advocates. Pictures were taken of my body, my face. Black eye, scratches, bruises. 

And I feel like it's not a big deal. I should just go home and apologize. I'm still in a foreign country. I have no family. I have one person willing to take me in temporarily. 

I have a job I love. I have a dog I adore. 

And I still feel guilty. I feel ashamed. I want to call him. Apologize. Over and over. Just go back. Let things blow over, move on. The world is already a dumpster fire, why should I make it harder on us. Why should I put his career and reputation in jeopardy.

He drank every night. And I just did it too. Seemed easier. It led to worse fights. But sometimes it just led to peaceful passing out.

domesticviolence,"Is violence irreversible after it has started? Like, if it's a box that has been opened, it generally becomes worse over time?

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

He has called me names, said really terrible things about me, and isolated me as thoroughly as he could.

My bf and I just moved into a 1 bedroom together 
We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons. Idk why...idk why I do these things to trigger him I just want his attention I want him to care...idk oh I gave him his keys he left but all his stuff is here. Oh yeah it all started on the evening of my birthday...we were having a good time and he asked why I changed my phone password so k jokingly said ""because I'm cheating on you"" and he was being a jerk after the joke so I blew up at him. I told him I honestly dont totally remember why and and I came home late after spending time with my girlfriends and he was mean about it on my bday.

UPDATE: he has been out of the apartment since the cops came. We both talked we both are taking time to ourselves but the plan was for it to just be a break...with all these replies, I know breaking up is the right thing to do. We had tried to break up before but live together and it didnt really stick.

I have male friends I want to hang out with since I wasnt allowed to because of my relationship with my bf but now that were in this weird middle ground I still feel like I shouldnt but I also feel like the amount of control he had over me was unfair and I want to be free of it. I got to talk to a friend that he wouldnt let me regularly talk to because he said it was ""disrespectful"".

domesticviolence,"Hi there. I (F32) left a 9 year long abusive relationship about 2 years ago. I have since moved on and got with an amazing man who has not even a shred of abusive tendencies in him. I love him more than I thought was possible - it's made me realise I don't think I ever loved my ex, only co-dependency feelings.   
I had not liked or really even tolerated my ex partner for a very long time, but I'd given up hope and so stayed, as we have a kid together.   
Eventually I saw behaviours in our child that I did not like (clearly mirroring his dad), and so I found the strength to get rid for good. I still have to have some contact with my ex, for obvious reasons. He has much more control over my life at this point, than I expected. I have so much regret that I even met him.  


Anyway, my issue is anger. I feel so angry with him all the time. Absolutely furious. Every day, all day, I have his voice in my head insulting me, criticising me and picking arguments. I then end up arguing back or defending myself. When I say voice I don't mean as in psychosis that I think it is real - it's just my thoughts, like day dreaming. This person has caused me so so so much damage, both emotionally and practically. I don't want him to continue causing me this much pain and anger on a daily basis, but my brain seems stuck in 4F mode.   


How on earth do I calm this anger?   
I have some grounding exercises to do, but it is often when I am doing housework or cooking, and so it's difficult to do the grounding stuff at that time. I end up in tears all the time. I have had severe depression for a very long time now, mostly due to certain things he controls in my life. I've tried to use music for distraction when I have to do these things, but it's not really doing much.

I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time.

domesticviolence,"I feel a mix of emotions. It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on. They don't live in the area but they offered to drive up to make sure I was ok (we had plans set for mid-june and that was when I was hoping to work on his moving out process).",Abusive boyfriend arrested.

He won't ever love me because I knew what a monster he is right from beginning.

He beat me. More frequently with each kid we got.
For what?
Not being perfect woman of his dream?
Not being a mom enough (his words)?
Not being chirly new blue eyed flirty woman he met?

I only feel shame that I wasn't determined to let him go when he beat me first time in front of our kids, but instead now when he loves other woman.

domesticviolence,"Hello guys,

I am very confused right now. My bf (26) of two years threw a clothes horse at me (23) two weeks ago.

 I have met this guy at my university in a very depressing time of my life. I grew up with my grandparents, my parents left me alone as a child, my dad abandoning me two times for two years. My grandpa had just passed away. I started going to therapy, which I am still doing and it helped me a lot, but he also helped me and was there for me, then I needed to cry and was very caring and empathetic. In fact he helped me heel a lot.

I really fell in love with him and wanted to become the best version of my self, kind and mindfull and empathetic. I was ready to work on every issue we had, learn to communicate better, meet his needs and be there for him...

So here is the thing, he always gets very upset and angry over small things. He starts crying then he has to do something in the household, so I end up doing it. I think he is a workaholic. He works up to ten hours every single day... In our two years of relationship he took like three weeks off. He says he feels empty and depressed then he is not working. He can't fight. Every time we have an argument, he rather leaves the room or stares at his phone. Two times he had punched a wall in front of me, blaming me for it. ""I push his buttons"". Then he started throwing stuff against the wall. He won't talk to me until I apologize for the argument (It is normally just me pointing out small things, that hurt or bother me). 

This time it was about my grandmothers birthday. I wanted to visit her and for him to come along. He struggled a said, that he would rather work. I got really sad and told him that it makes me said he doesn't care and he had an outburst and threw the clothes horse at me. I raised my arm and it left a scratch. Then he went silend and I packed my things and went away.

He then wrote a really long letter apologizing and we agreed to talk again a few weeks from then, after cooling down. And I don't know what to do. If I should try to work things out, find another way to solve our problems or just leave it and suffer a bit. I know that no relationship is perfect and that everthing needs work...

So here is the thing. I kind of know he can be very kind and creative and playfull and he really helped me. I don't want to hurt him and a part of me is excusing all this I guess. Like he is very stressed, works very hard, his mom has a depression and his parents really are always fighting, even getting violent... And I really have compassion for him and don't want things to end. On the other hand... It is not only this. He is so disrespectfull with my creative work, insulted my believes... One time he wanted me to write a two page essay, explaining why my policial opinion on a topic is wrong (It wasn't just the same as his). 

He cares a lot about what people think and gets upset then I am joking around with my friends and having fun, like just dancing around with my best friend Eva. He sais that this embarases him. 

Don't know... Could it all just get worse? Am I co-depended? Don't know... A part of me believes it is all my fault, that I am being to harsh, then expressing my concerns... I can get very sad sometimes, too and just lie in bed a cry. I also get angry, then he insults me... But I never try to harm him on purpose and I am trying to grow as a person and communicate better every time... Also noting that my dad is a narcissist and he wrecked my judgedment of people and situations... I feel so brainwashed.",My boyfriend threw a clothes horse at me,Elainea_Luria,2020-05-31 16:04:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gu1mrq/my_boyfriend_threw_a_clothes_horse_at_me/,6,1.0,4,8,696
domesticviolence,"I was dating my now 43 year old ex-girlfriend for 5+ years. We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.","Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun",Dickfitswell1138,2020-05-31 03:18:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/,6,0.83,20,9,3443

How can I help her?

Background -
We used to work together but have gone on to work for different companies. I have seen bruises and various cuts on her face, she said the abuse started with a ""playful"" dead arm or dead leg when arguing, then gradually got worse to a slap and then punches and kicks and even household items being used. 

This lady has 3 young children, one of the main reasons why she wont tell the police is the fear of her children being taken away from her.

I want to help, I don't know how to help.
What can I do? Are there any resources I could give to her to help?

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

domesticviolence,"I just recently ended my relationship with someone who was very very abusive to me a few days ago. It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going.

domesticviolence,"I was assaulted and strangled by my husband on March 31st. This was the first time he‚Äôd ever hit me, although he was probably emotionally and verbally abusive. A difference I see between my situation and many others is he immediately wanted to get divorced and for me and my daughter to move away, which now makes sense because he wanted to control the narrative and how many people found out about it. He told me he didn‚Äôt love me and didn‚Äôt want me, so on top of the assault I felt complete rejection. I‚Äôm glad on some level, because I didn‚Äôt have the option to stay and put up with more abuse, but it still hurts and makes me feel alone as a survivor. 
We lived in a town of 1000 people, I was a hairstylist for many of the people there and very active in the community. We were both from a different city where we knew even more mutual people. We have about 130 mutual friends on Facebook and many more in the small town. After I was able to get what I needed from him in our separation agreement and move to my mother‚Äôs, I posted a carefully written statement about my experience on social media. I also personally told many people in our community of friends, and my many clients who wanted to know where I was and when they could get a haircut. I had a huge response, people writing support and telling their own stories. It was really incredible. But the dust has settled and there are many people who never said a word, or acknowledged what happened. They continue to support him, or they say nothing at all. 
Our group of friends is one I would have considered violence-intolerant. They post about me too and believing women, they are liberal and outspoken. But when I went public a lot of them stayed silent. Now they‚Äôre posting about police brutality, specifically George Floyd. I watched the video of what happened to him and was triggered into a panic attack, remembering what it was like to not be able to breathe. I‚Äôm just as angry about what is happening to black people in America, and I never want to compare my experience, but isn‚Äôt it comparable? Isn‚Äôt women being abused by men as prevalent as people of color being abused by law enforcement? And I mean this on a very personal level, not just a global one. Why are these people posting constantly about the injustice of what happened to George Floyd, and staying silent about what happened to me? 
I‚Äôm so angry and I don‚Äôt have anywhere to put it. I posted two things to my IG story yesterday pretty much saying what I‚Äôve said here, but regretted it and took them down. I need support in this and my poor friends are so fatigued, I feel horrible for them. They empathize but can‚Äôt relate to what it‚Äôs like to be beaten and strangled, kicked out of your home with your child in a pandemic, and to speak out about it and be ignored. I know I‚Äôm focusing on the people ignoring me rather than the supportive ones, but it‚Äôs like a knife in my heart. This liberal ‚Äúwoke‚Äù group of people will speak up for someone they don‚Äôt know, but when their voice will actually have an impact they‚Äôre silent. And he‚Äôll get away with this and never be held accountable by anyone and I‚Äôm sitting here with this horrible pain.

domesticviolence,"Hey, I've never taken to an online forum before so please, just bear with me. I'm 16 btw with siblings 8 and 10 years old, my parents are in their late forties.

My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.

My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over. 

It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me. I want out.

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn‚Äôt even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn‚Äôt breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn‚Äôt good and I need to leave, I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We‚Äôve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn‚Äôt let me forget, he says it‚Äôs his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I‚Äôve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he‚Äôs finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn‚Äôt mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me.

I am currently in the process of moving to a new city to escape the toxic environment of the small town where I was born, raised, and my abuser lives.. 

I'm 20 right now and currently, in the middle of going to community college, I'm extremely lost and confused as to make sure I'm settled in this new city.  I did see that there is a Domestic Violence shelter here, but I worry that going there would be a waste of their time.

domesticviolence,"Hi so i am just looking for some help/advice on my situation with my boyfriend. Last night after dinner my boyfriend called me a bitch because he thought i was having an attitude towards him and i felt very offended by that, but almost immediately our friend came to visit and we didn't have time to talk about what happened or why he felt compelled to be mean to me. So at 4am when our friend left i was trying to ask him what happened and get a sincere apology from him but he kept shutting me down saying ""i'm tired"" and very minimal bland ""sorry"". I felt extremely frustrated by him because i needed to talk it out before we went to bed.

So after about 5 minutes of this i got up and he was still ignoring me when i kept pressing him about why he can't just understand how he hurt my feelings. I (vigorously) grabbed the pillows he was laying on and threw them on the ground just to make a point, and then took his covers off so he couldn't just be sleeping (as context we were both slightly drunk and i get i was being immature at this point). So he begins to laugh at me which makes me even more mad and calls me a stupid c*nt bitch, or something along those lines. At this point i'm SO fed up so i grab his laptop and say ""i'm taking your laptop and mine"". I did this because i knew he would at least have to look at me and i thought at this point he would just concede for the moment and realize i just need a solid apology in order to go to bed.

so the moment i grab his laptop he jumps out of bed and pushes me to the ground, gets on top of me and puts his hand on my neck and is choking me (not extremely hard but like my airway was definitely restricted), he slaps my face and says ""don't you ever fucking do that again or i'm gonna fucking kill you"" 

at that moment he says ""what.... what's going on... why did i say that"" and i start screaming and run out of the house because i feared for my life. thankfully i am okay and my only injury is around my hip area where he tackled me to the floor.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar

domesticviolence,"TW: Sexual assault, rape

I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I just feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be as bothered by this as I am. I‚Äôve been raped three times in my life, as well as sex trafficked. I feel if I call rape again, people are going to just stop believing me, I‚ÄôM going to stop believing me. I feel there‚Äôs only so many times you can say you were raped before people stop believing you.

To give a little bit of backstory, I have a very turbulent relationship with my parents. Last month, I (19 female) got into a huge argument with them, and my boyfriend (23, male, let‚Äôs call him Ryan) picked me up to stay with him in his basement apartment a few cities over.

I wouldn‚Äôt say my relationship with Ryan is the greatest. He is totally uncommunicative and it‚Äôs like pulling teeth trying to get him to explain his emotions towards me. He never cleans up after himself, always makes me do household chores (his laundry, his dishes, his cleaning of his room and stuff, in addition to my own chores).

I am also in school full time online (and have been for a couple weeks now) and haven‚Äôt even opened any of my courses because I‚Äôve been so busy. 
I also have no money coming in and have to apply for Ontario Works (social assistance).
In addition to that, my grandpa was just released from the hospital on palliative care with cancer and has very little time left, but I can‚Äôt see him because I‚Äôm sick (my doctor though it was covid but it‚Äôs actually a kidney infection that could lead to kidney failure. I‚Äôm on antibiotics right now).

Ryan and I broke up about a week ago after I (very difficultly) pulled out of him that he doesn‚Äôt enjoy spending time with me and would rather spend time alone. He sleeps till 4pm, wakes up, wants alone time from me so he goes for a walk, we have dinner while he looks at cars on his phone or watches tv, then he plays video games while I clean up after him. I fall asleep around 12pm and he stays up till 4am because he ‚Äúneeds a bit more alone time‚Äù (his words). 

So once Ryan and I broke up last week, he decided he wanted to go back home to his town a few cities over to see his mom and his dog. He was leaving Tuesday and said I can stay till Friday at the latest in his apartment. So I was scrambling to find an apartment quickly, get on Ontario Works, try to work on school work, send email updates to my grandpa, communicate with my therapist, and clean the apartment, all with a very painful kidney infection. 

Fast forward to last night, Ryan and I decide to have some edibles because I‚Äôm in a lot of kidney pain and very stressed out. 

To give some backstory on this, I don‚Äôt do well with weed. I suffer from something called cannabis-induced psychosis (it doesn‚Äôt happen every time though). The first time I ever had marijuana, it was shatter and I severely greened out, because I had waaaay too much. I was also sexually assaulted when I greened out. I think that, along with the fact that all of my sexual assaults have involved marijuana, just fucked up my tolerance. 

I took half a caramel edible last night. One caramel was 5 mg thc/cbd balance. I split it in half so that it was only 2.5mg. That‚Äôs not a lot at all, that‚Äôs a minuscule amount. Still, less than an hour later, I was forgetting every couple of seconds where I was, absolutely mind blown that there was a wall I could lean on behind me, felt like I could feel every molecule in the sheets I was sitting on, and amazed that I could coordinate my body to get a spoonful of ice cream from my cup to my mouth. I can‚Äôt believe how high I was on so little thc and cbd. It felt like I had the whole package. 

At some point, I remember becoming so freaked out by the fact that my body could move from sitting up to lying down. I‚Äôd be lying beside Ryan and then I‚Äôd sit up, become so freaked out, and then 3 seconds later, totally forget how I got from lying down to sitting up. I remember lying face-up on my back on the bed, leaning my head against the wall, and slowly slipping into a comatose-like state.

Ryan would poke me and tickle my feet, but I wouldn‚Äôt respond to any of it. If he tried tickling me, my brain would feel it, and my body too, but I couldn‚Äôt move to react to it. I could make small movements with my hands, but they were balled up into fists and my leg muscles felt so tight. I was squeezing all my muscles and when I would actively try to relax them, they would spasm and twitch and go back to being tight. 

I was staring at the ceiling. At some point, I remember my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and then closing my eyes and becoming aware of the fact that I was breathing, and controlling my breathing. I thought that if I stopped thinking about breathing, it wouldn‚Äôt happen naturally and I‚Äôd just suffocate. 

Ryan laid down beside me and asked if I was okay. He roughly pulled my eye open with his fingers and I couldn‚Äôt see anything. It felt like my eyes were in the back of my skull. All I could do at that point was move my mouth by smiling, even if I was freaking out in my head. My outside body and smile didn‚Äôt match the inside of my body and my mind. 

Even though I could hear everything going on and feel everything at the point, I couldn‚Äôt react to it or move or speak. I felt Ryan pushing my body around. Everything was weak. My arms felt heavy and my whole body was limp. He started grabbing me and I remember him saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just like a toy doll, I can do whatever I want to you‚Äù. I remember him taking my underwear off and fucking me. I wasn‚Äôt able to move or say anything but he was manhandling me, grabbing me hard, strangling me, and at one point he pushed me over and I forcefully hit my head against the cannot beside the bed. I still didn‚Äôt react and it didn‚Äôt hurt, but I remember feeling the pressure of the hit. 

At some point, he finished, and got up to go to the bathroom. I remember still being unable to move but freaking out in my head that I needed to call someone, anyone, to ask for help. 

When I was finally able to start moving and open my eyes, I stumbled around and slowly walked around the apartment, looking for my headphones and forgetting what I was doing every couple seconds. I couldn‚Äôt really talk or communicate, except say small sentences like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going walking‚Äù. 

He gave me his pocket knife and seemed genuinely worried about me going out at 3 in the morning by myself, high. I just wanted to get away to think. 

When I called a friend, she got mad at me and told me I should‚Äôve known I couldn‚Äôt handle weed. She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what happens when you do shit like that. Bad stuff will happen‚Äù. I felt like it was all my fault and felt guilty. So I went back home (it didn‚Äôt help that I was feeling very paranoid, like someone was following me). 

I got back home and, despite feeling like I had been gone for an hour, Ryan said I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes max. I don‚Äôt really remember the rest of the night, but I‚Äôm pretty sure we went to bed shortly after that.

The next morning, I woke up and felt so shitty about myself. I remember most of what happened, and my head was killing me from the forceful hit. When Ryan woke up, I asked him if he knew why my head was hurting so much, knowing full well he wouldn‚Äôt say anything. He couldn‚Äôt give me an answer, and said maybe it was my medications causing it. 

All day, I made casual comments about my head and my eye hurting, my arms hurting as though there were bruises developing, but nothing. He wouldn‚Äôt admit anything. It was only that night that he said with a laugh ‚Äúdo you remember us having sex last night?‚Äù. I said no and asked him to explain what happened, but he brushed it off and changed the subject. Fast forward a day, I wake up with swelling in my eyelid where he forced it open with his (probably dirty) fingers. Over the past couple days, the swelling has been getting worse, to the point where I can barely see out of my eye while I‚Äôm writing this.

Ryan has gone back home so I‚Äôm in the apartment by myself, with a lot of anxiety.

I thought I‚Äôd write this post basically to ask if this was wrong in any way? I know it‚Äôs a stupid question but, we were kind of still together (he‚Äôs my ex but it‚Äôs complicated. We still kiss, hug, have sex), and I just feel like there‚Äôs a reasonable explanation for why he did this. I‚Äôm pretty pissed about my eye though, especially because he won‚Äôt admit that he pried open my eye with his dirty hands day‚Äôs earlier. 

I think I‚Äôm just stunned right now that someone I trusted so much could do something like this. It makes me not want to trust anyone again :(

domesticviolence,"I am in need of assistance for safety planning via email or text. I am newly hearing impaired. I'm also a client of vocational rehabilitation and a University student.

I am in touch with my local domestic violence agency. I have not signed any contract with them yet.

Does anyone know about resources concerning text based safety planning? I contacted the deaf women's domestic violence and they seem to be regional. They also directed me to my local organization.

Does anyone know why safety planning is so difficult to do via email or text? I guess I'll start there. I understand the confidentiality issues. Has anyone ever done safety planning with a hearing-impaired survivor that has auditory processing issues due to hearing impairment, in a written form?

The reason I'm asking is that I am in urgent need of this and I am feeling like I'm bothering my local agency by asking them repeated questions. 

My therapist through the agency also told me that people don't usually fill out the forms on their own. Due to covid-19 restrictions requiring me to email the agency and not do the intake in person, I'm  concerned about sending the information about my abuser across email. Even if it is encrypted and tracked. Even if I send it through my cell phone used as a router. This is because I do not have time to check if my ex has monitored my cell phone. I have a burner phone but it is very cheap. It does not allow me to use it as a mobile hotspot. I have no way of physically getting out at the moment. Does anyone know if burner phones are still available? Can one still purchase a cell phone at Walmart/BestBuy/Target with cash? Or do contact tracing regulations cancel all of that?

Also, unfortunately due to hearing impairment I did not communicate flawlessly to my counselor or to the agency. As a result they seem to have mistakenly diagnosed me with autism. I truly love people with autism, have worked in research for 20 years, and have no discrimination against them. But I have no history of being diagnosed with such a label. I'm very concerned about this and I'm concerned about signing a contract because I'm afraid that I will be institutionalized inappropriately. I have read horror stories from Evan Stark about survivors accumulating labels and increasing their risk.
to add to my confusion, in my last session my therapist told me that the agency does not use labels, and does not write anything down, yet in my email requesting my advocate, he indicated that I had PTSD. Additionally, it was communicated in an email from the intake person that said that my therapist indicated that I had autism. All these emails were transmitted to me.

This risk of institutionalization due to mistaken incompetency is magnified for someone with a physical disability. Stating that it is the PTSD talking causing me to ask these questions does not address the confidentiality risks as well as my responsibilities to maintain confidentiality via rules. in addition I think it's relevant to mention that my abuser constantly threatens me stating that I will be institutionalized due to my disability causing me to look ""demented"" when people don't understand my hearing impairment. What tends to happen specifically is people can see that I can physically hear but I just can't understand the consonants in language anymore, especially on the phone. So phone conversations, including with my therapist, enabled me to hear 50 to 75% of what is said by the other person. In a life-threatening situation this is not constructive. I was referred to the domestic violence agency by my primary care physician and the abuse is documented in my medical records. 

I'm waiting for ear surgery and my hearing disability is well-documented. I also have captioning accommodations for my University. My abuser destroyed my captioning phone.

This well-intentioned attempt at labeling me may be because the domestic violence tactics were very severe and life-threatening, and the agency may want to protect me. But being hearing impaired running one's own business and being a full-time University student as well as holding another job does not indicate a label that could increase my risk. So I'm a little concerned and frightened and hesitant about signing any contract especially when I'm only able to communicate via the telephone that is captioned inaccurately, or via doxy me which could be a lower level of confidentiality due to the relaxation of HIPAA rules.

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone! I'm a CPS worker and I thought I'd just post some info here regarding some things I've seen in my line of work in reference to domestic violence. I hope it doesn't come across as guilt-tripping as that's not my intention at all. I only want whoever needs it to see the other side of the story from the child's perspective. I mostly work with female victims while my male coworkers work with male victims so most of the examples will be regarding mother victims as it's what I have experience with but the same concept applies to
 everyone.

At work, a lot of the time when talking to the victim I am told that they stay in the relationship for the kids, because they feel like the children will benefit from having two parents under the same roof instead of one or because they feel like a big life change (divorce) might be detrimental to the children. A two-parent household seems to be thought of as the ideal home for many victims regardless of the abuse happening in the home. And so I am here to talk about specifically that.

We get a lot of calls from schools in which young kids can't concentrate in school because they're worried about their mother and whether or not she's alive because parents fought the day before and dad said he was going to kill mom.

We get other calls in which a teen ends up in jail for harming or killing his father to defend their mother. Sometimes, when kids can't intervene, they end up feeling guilty for not being able to change things, even though it's not their responsibility.

All of this takes a toll. 99% of these kids have told me they were much happier after leaving the home or would have wished the victim parent could've left.

Personally, I have taken victims for restraining orders, accompanied them to court, found them a hotel or home to stay in, and even accompanied them to change the locks on the door. This doesn't happen for every worker, but there's some good ones out there.

So no, leaving the relationship is not detrimental to them. Witnessing abuse and parents fighting is what is largely psychologically impacting. And on that note, they don't have to be in the same room with the victim and abuser for them to be affected. Walls are thin. Even if they were out of the home at the time of the abuse, they might get home and see marks or bruises on the victim. Or even see the victim in a bad emotional state.

Please don't use your child as a reason. It puts stress on them and when they grow up, they can feel like a burden for making you stay.

Hope this was informational!


Edit: I do not encourage anyone to leave their children with the abuser or in a bad home environment unsupervised. Victims are always encouraged to leave the home with their children or have the abuser leave the home if possible. I know there's various reasons not to leave other than the ones mentioned here, this post is only regarding the reasons discussed here.",Staying for the kids,quietplease6,2020-05-27 18:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/grpl5t/staying_for_the_kids/,55,1.0,60,4,525

domesticviolence,"I don't know why it is like this. I am going to refer to my ex as M.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship.

domesticviolence,"Please help-Trial

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don‚Äôt want to look at him, though I‚Äôm sure I will be asked. I‚Äôve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I‚Äôve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say ‚Äúyou beat me I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I‚Äôve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I‚Äôm afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I ‚Äúlose‚Äù no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it‚Äôs been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn‚Äôt serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure.

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO‚Äôs behavior, like their family, because you are worried about their health? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling.  Re-posting because maybe it will help someone here some day. 

Background: I am interested in everyone‚Äôs perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren‚Äôt things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don‚Äôt buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I‚Äôm not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That‚Äôs why this has been difficult for me. 

I know the answers are obvious, but the Reddit community is helping me come to terms with everything.

My 5 siblings and I were originally living at home until the past 2 years, when everyone grew too tired of the situation at home. Most of them have cut off contact with my father and only text or call my mom once a week or every other week.

Last month my mother caught my father cheating and kicked him out of the home. He didn't really care and left. My mother is financially independent, has good health, and family support. We got her private counseling so that she would not take him back (this is not the first time he cheats and he had been yelling at her so we didn't want it to escalate).

She had been doing well until her session. I don't know what exactly the counselor said to her but she told me it was along the lines of ""everyone deserves a second chance and it's all fixable"". Lo and behold she kept visiting him at the place he's staying at, cooking for him, and buying him supplies. Two days ago he beat her up. She refused to report any of this to law enforcement. He told her after that that he wants to work things out.

Like I said I'm an adult and financially independent too. I am currently living with my mother mostly because we have space available here and I wanted to physically be here for her. I had already told her that I couldn't stand seeing her do this to herself because it's too emotionally taxing for me to stay if she does not plan to change things.

Does anyone know of any counseling or therapy resources that might actually help her? At this point, I'm at a loss of how to help her. I'm sure she'll take him back home once I'm not physically here to prevent it from happening but if I could at least give her some resources before then, it could make a difference.

Having gone through depression myself I messaged her and told her to hang in there, and that things get better but that it would take work and time. She then responds saying her husband abuses her daily and that her parents don‚Äôt believe her because he‚Äôs convinced them that she‚Äôs crazy.

I just wanted to tell everyone thank you so much for the advice and for taking the time to read my story. I left yesterday. I made arrangements to move out of state in the middle of next month. For the time being, I am staying at a friend's. I packed most of our stuff in garbage bags, and we left. Things are gonna be tough for a while but it's honestly amazing the way God has laid everything out and how well things are working this time. When I started making plans all the details just started coming together. Thanks again everyone for the support and encouragement ******
I'm having a hard time sorting out my thoughts about everything. My boyfriend was recently arrested for the 3rd time for assaulting me. This time he was charged with strangling me, and with child endangerment for doing so in front of our 5 year old. We've been together for 8 years. He popped my elbow out of place the first time he was arrested about 7 years ago. I had to go to the hospital that time and have my arm in a sling for several weeks. The 2nd time,  3 years ago,  he punched me in the face multiple times, then grabbed our daughter and took off in the vehicle with her. We had to convince him he wouldn't be arrested to get her brought back safely. He ended up going to rehab that time for 6 months, but was relapsing soon after getting back home and it wasn't long before he was being violent again. The times he's physically abused me are too many to count. He's held me in a room with a knife to my throat threatening to kill me and screaming at me for 2 hours. He's slammed my head into the back of the ceramic toilet so hard that my vision went black and I thought I was going to die. He held a machete to my throat a few months ago and threatened to kill me again. He's choked me so hard that I couldn't breathe and hand handprints on my throat at least 5 times. There's so much more. Typing this stuff brings up feelings of resentment, hopelessness, anger, fear, I literally have tears in my eyes thinking about it. But I'm still struggling to make the decision to leave. I have an opportunity to finally leave because he was put in jail and is now in rehab. I need to go before his 28 day rehab stay is over. But, for some reason the rehab is allowing him to call me repeatedly, at least 3 times a day; and it's really hard on me. He's not even legally supposed to be contacting me. But no one is monitoring him when he's on the phone. And I can't call and say anything to the staff. It's a really horrible situation. My daughter and I are still in his house, which his parents own. They come over here constantly. They want to make sure I'm around for him to support him in rehab and to make sure he gets his life together when he gets out. They keep telling me he deserves another chance. It's so ridiculous. It really hurts me. I've had to call his parents or go to their house many times with my daughter because of his violence. They always bring me right back here to him. One time I ran out of the house and took his vehicle and drove to their house after he had punched me so bad that my eye had swollen shut. My daughter had spent the night at their house the night before and was already there. They brought my daughter and I home to him less than 2 hours later. I have to get away from here. I know this short rehab stay won't help him. I want to do what's best for my daughter and I. I've been controlled by him, and his family, for so long and I'm scared. I'm scared to make my own decisions. I feel so unsure of myself. I just want to raise my daughter in a stable and healthy environment. I hope I'm doing the right thing. I don't think he deserves any more chances. I've been afraid he was going to kill me so many times. This is my only shot.

domesticviolence,"So about a year ago was the last attack from my ex boyfriend. He gave me a black eye (my second one) and punched me in my back several times. I have not seen him since. I have struggled to cope and heal from the aftermath of that relationship. I am good friends with his sister (was for years before our relationship) and am very close to his family. All of them have encouraged me to press charges in the past but I‚Äôm only now feeling ready. I‚Äôm located in Illinois and not sure of the law here regarding time limit with this kind of thing. Obviously will speak to a lawyer but wanted to get some input here first if anyone has any information. Anyway, my ex hit me many times and I have pictures of the 2 black eyes he gave me, but no proof of any of the other attacks. I am friends with his son‚Äôs mother who also says she was abused by him when she was with him and has given me an eerily similar description of what their relationship was like. She never pressed charges either. I recently also came into contact with another ex girlfriend of his who he used to abuse - he actually broke her ribs on the last attack. I am aware of other women he has dated and used and abused as well. He is a serial abuser and I believe he needs to be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago they were. I also believe he will hurt someone else and am afraid he will go too far one day. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any information that could help me in this situation? Is there a timeline for when you can report or press charges for physical assault? Would all of the women have to file a police report in order for their stories to matter?

domesticviolence,"Pretty much the title. It applies to myself, but also many other women I‚Äôve known.

They‚Äôre not stupid or ignorant, and they do the best anyone could. They‚Äôre not insecure or weak. They‚Äôre looking for the same things everyone else on this planet is.

They get therapy after the first abusive relationship and ‚Äúput in the work‚Äù. They wait before going into another relationship, and know the signs. They excel and are happy in every other (non-romantic/sexual) area of their lives, usually, from career to finances to developing community and close friendships. They have strong senses of self and self-esteem.

They know the warning signs, and leave partners as soon as they begin to exhibit them. They seek and listen to anything a therapist or friend might say about a new partner‚Äôs vibe, personality, treatment.

They don‚Äôt die from the abuse, because they‚Äôre strong and smart enough to walk away.

But repeatedly, at a percentage significantly higher than the general population‚Äôs, they find themselves *having* to walk away from yet another abuser. Maybe the abuser hides all signs for the first few months, or even until a proposal or marriage. The abused woman isn‚Äôt stupid, and he fooled everyone else around her as well. She learned from her mistakes the first time. She sought others‚Äô opinions and listened to her gut. 

Yet so many of us end up with yet another abuse story. We ultimately end up ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, sure, as we either leave or effectively give up and remain single.

These abusers ultimately reveal‚Äîafter hiding or denying it previously‚Äîpast partners they abused. I wouldn‚Äôt condone victim blaming, but I‚Äôd almost like to blame myself, as that‚Äôd give me some control here. But I can‚Äôt.

So, why is the ideal outcome of finding a loving, healthy, respectful partnership with someone we‚Äôre sexually attracted to so elusive and rare for us? Are we sexually geared to only be attracted to the pheromones of an abuser? Is that physically even possible? If it‚Äôs biological, is it possible to change this? Are we all doomed to biological infertility unless we do it all on our own? Are we just permanently damaged and destined to be single, or with an abuser? Why does this keep happening? Why does it keep happening to women who were happy on their own and with everything in their lives, aware of the signs, and so on?

And please, although I know there‚Äôs a massive selection bias here, and the stats show you‚Äôre the rarer case, if you have a success story that involves a happy, healthy marriage, please do share :)","Why do so many women who, after being abused once, end up alone or having to leave yet another abuser?",whoiamidonotknow,2020-05-25 18:03:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqfu74/why_do_so_many_women_who_after_being_abused_once/,6,1.0,9,20,424
domesticviolence,"This may kind of be a ridiculous question but I've read a lot about TBI's and PTSD (which I have, I was diagnosed with PTSD before I even met my current abusive partner.

I want to and I'm going to) But in 5years time I've written off my memory problems and some other things that could be a TBI or it could be stress and PTSD!

He asked me to repeat myself one time as he heard me talking and I repeated the stupid question-that made zero sense and when he asked me WTF I was talking about I began crying again out of frustration because he didn't understand me. But at the time, even I didn't understand me and I knew I was making no sense. And I remember most of this actually all of it as far as I know. It's like the words were just falling out of my mouth and I couldn't stop them and I couldn't interject anyting sensible.

A few of these incidences have occurred in the last few years but I always end up being fine afterwards. Is it even possible that I have damaged that I don't know about?

domesticviolence,"
This might be a long post. I apologize in advance. 




Okay so to start let me give you the backstory of my previous relationship. I will try to be brief. I was 17 and fresh outta high school messing with a man who was 23 years older than me. Within months of meeting him i moved in with him (on my 18th birthday). He almost immediately became controlling and possessive. About a month into living with him he beat me unconscious for the first time. I tried to leave he begged me to stay, promise to never do it again, bought me expensive gifts to say sorry, and of course gave me some money. Of course I believed him and forgave him. He was sweet again for maybe a week - if that long before we got into it again. He slaps me but this time i fight back. By the time we‚Äôre done we are both bloody and bruised. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt count as abuse if you fight back right? We just had a fight. People fight.‚Äù This is a phrase i said to myself throughout the rest of our relationship. Soon we‚Äôre physically fighting every day if not every other day. It got to the point that i no longer waited for him to hit me first whenever he got that certain look on his face i would swing first. It got to the point that all we would do is fight and fuck. I lived with him for a total of 11 months. I stayed through all the physical abuse, the verbal abuse, being beaten into a miscarriage, being locked in a room for days, and so much more. It took something extremely drastic for me to finally leave him (i wont share what cause its extremely fucked up and doesn‚Äôt pertain to this particular post. Maybe ill share my story with him more in depth another day) and when i did i was at the lowest place I‚Äôve ever been mentally. 

Once i left the relationship i was so low i tried, unsuccessfully thankfully, to take my own life. I took that as a sign that i wasnt my time. I tried to get back to the life i had before him. I thought that would help bring me out that low place but it didnt. The same things didn‚Äôt bring me joy anymore cause i was no longer same person. The naive innocent little girl who entered that relationship died with it. I began smoking weed everyday and drinking just to cope with having to still live life. I was always the strong one emotionally so noone ever knew how i was really feeling and how i was still so close to giving up. 

Three months later i still can‚Äôt shake the feelings of hopelessness. It was like I couldn‚Äôt find where i belonged in this world anymore. I decide that it would be the night id go for it again and this time i wouldn‚Äôt fail. I decide to give my self a fun ‚Äúlast day‚Äù and spend majority of it just being out and about with my closest friends at that time. I had recently reconnected with an old friend (lets call him Sean and hit him up on some humbug shit. A part of me trying to prolong what i had planned.

We spend the night just smoking, talking, vibing. Before i know it its 4:00 in the morning. We end up having mind blowing sex. I didnt feel so miserable anymore, it made me rethink. Before i know if me and Sean start messing around heavy. After a month we make things exclusive. He‚Äôs shared all the issues he had going on at the time (he had been shot multiple times the year before and got arrested because the people that shot him claimed he was trying to rob them even though there was proof that it wasn‚Äôt true. So now he was fighting a case. ) i told him everything id been through in my last relationship. He helped me through having nightmares &amp;amp; panic attacks. Helped build my self confidence up. Basically he lifted me out of that darkness. 

Now here‚Äôs where the issues began, i hadn‚Äôt allowed myself to heal from my last relationship so i still reacted to things as i would have with my ex. Whenever me and Sean argued and it got really heated i got physical and always taunted him to be physical back. I constantly accused him of cheating, randomly went through his phone, etc. After we had our first son the physical stuff got worse. We would fight each other leaving scratches a small marks on each other. And the violence only got worse once i found the proof of him cheating and cheated back for get back (yes he knew. I told him the next day). Now we‚Äôre fighting multiple times a day both bruised, bloody, busted lips, you name it. Neither of us trusting the other one.

Then i end up pregnant with our youngest child. I expect the fighting to stop. I was always the one to throw the first lick in our fights so i figure just stop hitting him. Simple right? No. He no longer cared who threw the first hit. We‚Äôd grown accustomed to the fighting and he no longer had an issue hitting me first. We fought worse when i was pregnant than when i wasn‚Äôt. He‚Äôd choke me until i passed out. Id throw anything i can get my hands on at him. Me biting and scratching him. Us pulling each others hair out. 

Id turned my relationship into exactly what i had just escaped. Our most recent fight was yesterday. I dont even remember why. He choked me and scratched my neck up. Stomped me in the stomach multiple times. Hit me in the head with a bottle drawing lots of blood. Along with slamming against the wall a few times. I bit his arm until it bled. Kicked him in the nuts. Busted his lip. Scratched his arms and chest up. And threw a hair brush at him. I dont know how to get us out of this place. Both of us have horrible anger issues and will not hesitate to be physical with the other one

But when its good. Its good! Like even when we mad at each other we got each others back. He‚Äôs still my best friend. Our relationship is bipolar and i just want to remove the toxic elements and according to him. He does too. We want a better relationship and to show our kids better but have no idea where to even start ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",I turned my current relationship into what I escaped in my previous relationship.

I got out my iPad, which has been in a cabinet for at least a few years, opened the Chrome app, and opened a new tab. It showed me my browsing history, and it showed me my ex-husband's browsing history for over a year or two, even current stuff by month. I haven't seen him for six months. 

Apparently he had logged in with his work gmail account on my iPad at some point in the past, years ago, and I had access to everything current and past, including his coworker's login to zoom with password already entered (I can't read the password but I could just hit login and be in his account). 

I had a friend help me log out of my ex's account and then clear the history, but I wanted to let you know that if you have a stalker or someone who would and could use this information, this is a huge vulnerability. If you have used a device to log in to chrome, that device retains the information - even current information - if you are using a different device. 

Here is more information from Google Chrome on how to clear your login history, I'm not sure if this will help with a device you don't have access to now, but I'd start here:

I cleared his history off that, as well. 

If you know more technical information on clearing browsing history and login accounts on shared devices, please do share it. Fortunately my ex isn't a stalker, nor am I, but it was a bit startling.

I was very frustrated both with the task at hand and him. I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me. He then head-butted me in the forehead.

It really hurt and (3 days later) I still have headaches. He did apologize but told me it was also my fault for escalating the fight when he was stressed and sleep deprived.

I *want* to let it go. I want to accept his apology and his promises that this will never happen again, and accept that I had a hand in it by being horrible when he was so tired and stressed out.

domesticviolence,"Financially dependent on abuser, ways to leave

I‚Äôm posting this for a friend. 
My friend (47) has been abused by her husband (60) for the last 25 years. He‚Äôs a narcissist with anger issues who sees himself as a victim in his own life. He‚Äôs incredibly verbally, emotionally financially and sexually abusive. He isolated her when she was 23 and he was in his late 30s. He‚Äôs taken up the best years of her life and if she doesn‚Äôt leave she will either kill herself or the stress will kill her. She lives in MN but she is originally from Turkey. She‚Äôs a citizen. She had 4 children, most of whom are adults. The younger two are in high school or going to college. The husband threatens to not pay for their college if she leaves them and he tells tha children. Her youngest has anxiety and is always worried that her mother is going to leave her behind or that she won‚Äôt get to go to college. She has places to go but doesn‚Äôt feel like she can leave. She has no self esteem and no degree. She‚Äôs financially dependent on him and so are her children. If there was a way that she could safely leave and have some financial leverage from him she would.  The situation is much more complex than this obviously and her plan is to leave in two years when her youngest will be going to college but that‚Äôs too far away and she‚Äôs getting worse everyday.

Last night was bad.. my partner started yelling at me because I was sad over my grandma being hospitalized and possibly not going to make it.

He told me to leave him the fuck alone so I spent the night on the couch. While all this was happening I felt like it was not real and I was watching from someone else‚Äôs point of view. I was shaking and crying for a long time. I woke up with a huge headache and I was just physically feeling sick all day.

domesticviolence,"ALRIGHT. SO. Excuse me because I've pumped up the overtime this week and I am consequentially BUZZED.   


2013, boyfriend at the time beat me so severely I had reconstructive surgery and some titanium put into my skull to prevent my eye from falling into the back of my head because my orbital floor was blown out. He went to jail. Bonded out. I was right there with him when he bonded out. As a matter of fact, I CHALLENGED him to bond out. I didn't think he could put up the $10k. But he did. I was pregnant at the time and strung him along from July to August, just lashing out and taking my pain out on him but still seeing him frequently. Typing this, I realize how fucked up it was that he was able to come to my house and be angry during this window and the worst he did to me was throw a cup of Mountain Dew across the room out of frustration because I kicked him out after making him bring me Taco Bell (here's a key indicator that no, he doesn't have anger issues... nor issues of control). There was a lot of other abuse prior to the whole skull part but the only other significant ones were: threatening to kill me and my mom while threatening to cut off his ankle monitor and biting my head because he thought I was on Facebook but found out I actually wasn't on Facebook and also when he pinned me to the bed for 3 hours, taunting me after punching me in the face while I held my daughter and was pregnant with our own. Yikes.   


He went to prison for 6 years on a 10 year sentence. Every single parole hearing, I fought it. I told the state ""No, he does not deserve to get out. No. He does not deserve to be free."" And the state even ruled him as a ""danger to society."" Awesome. Great. I achieved all that was necessary. But I never went to therapy. I never understood trauma bonding. I didn't understand why every 18 months or every time a parole hearing came around I would send him a nasty JPay message telling him how much I hated him. But he could never respond because I blocked any and all of his incoming mail. He once even tried to send me a package of jail books that actually got through with the paperwork he received from the prison showing him that I personally requested the blockade on the mail. As if I didn't know this already.  


And then in July 2019, he paroled. He was released to the county jail on detainers from the violations of protective order from 2013.  They were dismissed due to age. I got the text at 9PM on July 26th that he was to be released from county. I called his parents looking for him. I called the jail trying to find out where he was. I messaged his instagram, the only still-standing social media and contact I had with him and I waited. I waited around for two days. Pacing. Talking to my friends, waiting for him to message me. After six. years.   


And he did. He messaged me. He proclaimed his love for me. I proclaimed my love for him. And I fell right back in again. Keep in mind, I never received any therapy. No counseling. There was no resolution for my feelings and I never knew what trauma bonding was.  


Within two to three days of seeing him again, we were drinking one night after I got off of work and I went outside to smoke some pot really quickly. He was on parole and on an ankle monitor so he couldn't come with. I came back inside and he pulled me down the hallway by my hair. He pressed it must've been because he was drunk and jealous he couldn't smoke. I honestly knew this excuse was bullshit but I wanted him back so badly because my previous six years had been absolute hell and full of promiscuity and failed relationships.  


A few days after this, while having sex, buzzed again (he doesn't have any issues with drugs or alcohol btw, I had a bit of an issue and also wanted the alcohol to ease my feelings and nervousness with him) he put his hands around my throat and I fought him off of me and scratched his face and he finally let go of my throat.  


He was good for a while... Released from prison July 27th, 2019. Only two small incidents, you know? Until August 17th, 2019. We were drinking. I blame myself for the drinking parts, honestly. But I do not blame myself for his violence. We BBQ'ed. It was an awesome time. It was fun, in fact. He let me do the BBQ'ing. I've never gotten to do that before. We put our daughter to bed who had just learned days before this that he was her father. How exciting. Six years without a dad and now you can match your stomach moles and beautiful, full lips with the man who helped create you.   


Around 12AM, quite a few drinks later. He got mad at me. I don't know for what. I can't remember for what. But I wanted to go home and I told him I wanted to go home. And he grabbed my phone. And he smashed it into the wood planked floors. And I knew exactly what was coming after that. It was the same exact thing that happened in 2013. I knew it was coming. And I still couldn't help but mouth ""Here comes 2013 (insert his name) again."" He charged me and he smacked me and I was SHOOK. I went to the bathroom and could see the bruising that aligned the inside of his finger tips above my lip. I told him I was leaving and I went to grab our daughter. I started walking to the front door and he shoved me. He shoved me so hard I fell and I instinctively moved our daughter to the side because I knew what was coming.   


He smacked me. Open hand. Over and over and over and over again. Blood flew down the hallway. Some of it as far as 4-5ft away from where my body sat upon impact. He shoved me into the bathroom and stuck our daughter on the cell phone to watch a show while I stood and bled in the shower and cried. I tried to step out in an effort to calm and comfort him because I was in pure survival mode at this point and I saw him pouring bleach down the entire hallway and cleaning up -- what was literally -- the crime scene. He bleached it like a murder scene out of a movie and I slunk back into the bathroom.  


I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew I had to do some kind of manipulation to get out of there. I put my daughter in bed, her pajamas covered in my blood. And I told her mommy was okay and we would be going home soon.  


I spent an hour convincing him that I was okay and he wasn't going back to prison and I instructed him on how to care for my wounds. I helped him get me an ice pack and inflammatory medications. And he helped dress my wounds. I convinced him to call a fellow felon and his old prison cell mate who we had just FaceTimed earlier that day. I told him if I was going to go home, this is someone he could trust and someone we could confide in to not go to the police as he was on parole as well (bank robbery, no victims). He would call his friend a few times and his friend kept trying to get through to him. My boyfriend would give me the window to start telling this guy the address and then he would hang up. He was taunting me. The friend would call again. My boyfriend finally gave me the space to say the whole address. He had to drive from 2 hours away. But he did it.  


At some point, while bloody and swollen, chunks of my hair easily brushed away from my head, he asked me ""So what's up, you wanna fuck?"" And I let him. It's so entirely fucked up but I let him right then and there. And then in the middle of it, there was a knock at the door. It was finally my saving grace, his friend. His friend tried, and I could see it, he tried to contain his horrific reaction. He stared at me and put his hand behind my back and guided me to get our daughter. He stood right behind me and in between my boyfriend and guided me to the car. We got my daughter strapped in. He helped me.  


He went back inside while I strapped in the carseat and was talking to my boyfriend. I came back in, why? I don't know. But I did. And I ran my hand through my bloody, matted hair. I got to the back of my head and a huge chunk of hair came out and onto my hand. And I handed it to my boyfriend. And said ""Here you go."" He asked me ""What? Do you want some more?"" And he laughed. He laughed at me in front of this person that was supposed to save me.  


And his friend said ""Go wait in the car."" At that moment, I was trusting my life in the hands of someone I had never met before. And the friend came and got in the car. And he drove me home. And on the way home, he told me that he had no idea of my husband's charges and that he had hidden all of his charges in prison and stated the assault he was convicted of was on a man. And then this friend told me how his father had killed his mother. And that's why he started robbing banks after being put in foster care. And he warned me. And warned me. And begged me not to return. He told me he didn't care how far the relationship went with his ex-celly, that my presence and my situation hit home for him far more and was far more important than someone he went to prison with. And I couldn't be more grateful for this man's existence. Honestly.  


Anyway so I went to the hospital after that. I had a burner phone (learned from the first time). I had called EMS and they did a transport. No broken bones, etc. Just some stitches this time, by the grace of God.  


And then on September 6th, 2019... I married him. Not the friend. But my boyfriend. I married my boyfriend that had just beaten the life out of me and I had to beg for freedom for two weeks later. I got married with two black eyes.   


And the abuse continued. Of course it continued. Why wouldn't it?  


From December 2019 to January 2020, in a 2 week period... 14 days. He had laid his hands on me and threatened to kill me 9 times.   


It was on a Sunday that he last hit me. I waited and tried to persevere all day. I was constantly having mental breakdowns at this point because of the abuse (and he would come in and be captain save this girl and skip work to help my mental state by over coddling me from the pain he had caused, really). He went to work that next Monday morning and I called into work. I told him I needed to take time and just be okay mentally and he agreed and he left for work. I packed all of his essentials into a laundry basket and set them by the door. Around 3PM that day, I told him that he would not be coming home that night and he had to stay elsewhere. He detested that idea. He insisted he at least come by to pick up essentials to stay with his mother and I told him no. I told him he was not welcome to come pick up his things and if he came, I would call the police. Because I knew at that moment, if he came home, he would either a) beat the life of out of me/kill me or b) lure me in all over again. Honestly, in hindsight, I think B would be attempted and when it wasn't applicable, A would happen.  


He then proceeded to threaten me. He told me that I was going to need my gun if I ever saw him again (I got a gun in 2017 actually to protect myself against him, again, yikes). He told me he was going to come and kill me. We had shared location settings on our iPhones (I cleaned houses all over the southern part of our state for a living and some people were sketchy, I was by myself a lot and it was a safety measure prompted by me. Although I'm sure he loved it too bc he could keep an eye on me) I could see he was on his way to me. So I called his cousin who had seen me battered and bruised in August -- coincidentally I had just been in a very bad car crash so I blamed my bruising on that when she happened upon me accidentally... But one night in the kitchen (he was paroled to her house) she told me, in front of him, that if he ever abused me, she didn't care if he was family or not, I could come to her. And she could be my safe space. So I called her that day. I told her ""Do you remember this talk we had in the kitchen? 2013 was because of me. The bruising wasn't from the car crash. And now he's on his way to kill me."" And she told me ""I'm on my way.""  


But the problem was -- she wasn't on her way. She contacted him to see where he was and he immediately drove back to work. She went to his work. WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS, MIND YOU. She wanted to intercept him. I get that. I understand that. And from her view -- she did. She succeeded in that and at no point in time can I fault her for this. But she never told me this. She told me she was coming to me and she lived 17 minutes away. 30 minutes passed and she never came and he was still erratically texting me and I called 911.  


The police came, and they told me they couldn't protect me and wait around all night. So they took me with them to the police station after I packed a bag. And they took a statement and in the middle of the statement is when I received a call from his cousin. She told me she was with him and that he was calm and would be staying at her house that night. And then she handed the phone to him. And my eyes bulged and I hung up. She texted me apologizing for not understanding but still.   


So unknowingly really, I made the statement against my now husband. And he's now sitting on a $175,000 bond for 2 counts of family violence, 1 count continuous family violence, a parole violation, and a violation of a protective order and honestly? I don't think he's ever coming home. I supplied the detective with multiple admissions of guilt (such as: Are you ever going to apologize for slamming my head into the ground? ::  I'm sorry).   


I don't know. I don't know why I've typed all of this. I am safe. And I know of trauma bonding now. And I know that I am severely trauma bonding and I am trying to break these holds as we speak.   


I just want to kind of put my story out there and tell you guys:  


Please. Take the resources of counseling. Take the family support. Take everything. Be as selfish and greedy as you can be in your HEALTHY recovery. Or you may end up being as selfish and greedy as I was in re-obtaining the love I once thought I had.

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it.

domesticviolence,"I work with a woman who dated my abusive ex's brother. I'm still working with her, after dumping my ex, I see that she's an amazing worker, kind and polite, but deep down I'm so scared of her. She was with my ex's brother for a few months, she hung out around our shared apartment and at that time she was very unkind and impolite. But when I think about that time, the things I saw as unkind were blown out of proportion by my ex and his brother. Like we were being pitted against one another. They wanted me to hate her. I feel so much anxiety talking to her, so much doubt about what she's saying about the abuse she faced. I don't know how to deal with it. I never want to doubt her, or victim shame her, yet i feel conditioned to do so. I want to share our experience and bond over it but at the same time I'm very scared of it and find myself projecting onto her, and suffering from the way my ex treated her and his brother did. She tries to talk to me, she's kind and curious. Asking thoughtful questions, and it scares me, and I'm sick of it.

domesticviolence,"Me[25F] and my ex[31M] had been together for about 9/10 years. I left him about 2 weeks ago. It‚Äôs been draining for me and right now I don‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we‚Äôre over. I‚Äôm in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn‚Äôt go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It‚Äôs really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I‚Äôm most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it‚Äôs dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She‚Äôs been basically ignoring me since I‚Äôve been here and I am scared of how she‚Äôll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She‚Äôs very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn‚Äôt listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don‚Äôt press charges on him while I still have ‚Äúproof‚Äù (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don‚Äôt want to press charges just yet. I‚Äôm not planning on going back to him but I‚Äôm not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won‚Äôt ever end. He‚Äôs called me numerous times and his last text said that he‚Äôll give me my space but we‚Äôre goin got talk. I haven‚Äôt responded to him. I‚Äôm thinking about showing my mom that I haven‚Äôt spoken to him and that I‚Äôll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won‚Äôt go back and hopefully she‚Äôll get off my back about making a report.

domesticviolence,"I (24f) just got out of an emotionally , psychologically and physically abusive relationship with my ex (25m/who is in a wheelchair from a motorcycle accident. Not paralyzed, just limited movement)(he was the abuser). 
I‚Äôve called the police on him 2 times and he was arrested both times. Both times alcohol was involved. 
The first time, it was in September 2019. He hit me and gave me a black eye when we were arguing. I went home and called the police. I tried to get a restraining order against him but the civil family court judge oddly didn‚Äôt grant it. 
Fast forward a couple months later (I know I should‚Äôve have gone back to him but, that‚Äôs what happened) and we have reconciled and are back together. The gaslighting, emotional and psychological abuse continued. 
The second time, was in January 2020. We were at a hotel and he became physical with me and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave. I just wanted to go home and he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave as he would block the door with his wheelchair. Long story short, I was strangled, bleeding and ended up banging on the walls and screaming for help. The hotel employees forced their way in to help me. I called the police and they arrested him. 
The first time he got arrested, it was a civil case and his mom bailed him out. The second time was a criminal case and bail was set higher and he spent a week in jail.

domesticviolence,"
So when lockdown was announced me (f22) and my boyfriend (m24) decided that I would spend it at his house where he lives with his mum and sister. His mum was fine with this as we get on well, his sisters boyfriend would also be staying and spending his days in the house as he and I both can‚Äôt work. My boyfriend and his sister are both essential workers. 

My boyfriends sister has never liked me and has previously informed my boyfriend ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not bothering with her because I tried with all the rest and they all go in the end‚Äô. So after that comment I‚Äôve tried not to get in her way or join in too much in her conversation. 

About 2/3 weeks into lockdown it all kicked off, we were all in the kitchen at the time and my boyfriend was making general conversation that they were either ignoring or giving short answers too, he ended up asking his sister why we‚Äôd been blocked on all social media and what the problem was. Firstly they started saying to leave it alone and that she‚Äôs done with him, then she was shouting calling me a bitch and a cow, saying that I‚Äôm a creep because she can‚Äôt hear me coming down the stairs. 

As this was happening I was stood across the opposite side to them in the kitchen, stunned for words, his sister is 6ft so when she kicks off everyone‚Äôs frightened. Then she started to say I couldn‚Äôt speak for myself and I was stood there ‚Äòlike butter wouldn‚Äôt melt‚Äô so I simply said to her ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm not a (bad word)‚Äôlike you. 

They both then barged past me through the door, she elbowed my arm then made a fist and punched the side of my face, I think if she‚Äôd hit my eye I definitely would‚Äôve had a black eye. I was left holding my face in shock as they went upstairs and my boyfriend followed them up to defend me. 

Since then we were able to go to a family members house that was empty to quarantine together alone. The empty house now needs to be sold so we‚Äôre back living above his sister. The day before we came back she sent this text;

‚ÄúMum mentioned you and (my name) are coming back home, I‚Äôm sorry for what happened. Can we at least try and be civil whilst we are in lockdown together? Me and (her boyfriend) have been civil with mum, I hope we can do the same- without arguments. I hope you and (my name) are doing ok? And work has not been too stressful for you? Stay safe and see you soon. ‚Äú

Tbh I just found this to be a further slap in the face, a half assed apology for ‚Äòwhat happened‚Äô not that she hit me? Not that she makes everyone so frightened we had to leave? My boyfriend ended up not replying as he didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat before we got back. It‚Äôs been six days now and we haven‚Äôt even crossed paths, I‚Äôm not looking forward to it. His sister is famous for not apologising and completely believes in herself, as well as her boyfriend who just goes along so he‚Äôs not in her war path. 

I‚Äôm not sure I can ever forgive her, and Id like to know what others would‚Äôve done in mine and my boyfriends position? 

TL;DR! My boyfriends sister hit me, and we‚Äôve come back after a month of living in a separate house to her pretending like it never happened with no real apology. I‚Äôm not sure I can ever forgive her.

domesticviolence,"I am losing my mind. We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off.

domesticviolence,"I had been with my ex partner for 5 years. 3 years ago I bought a house for us with the intention of us being together and eventually marrying  and having kids....if we could get our relationship on track. 

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn‚Äôt recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That‚Äôs all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I‚Äôm still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don‚Äôt feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve?

domesticviolence,"So some back story:
 
I had an abusive father for the first 15 years of my life. In his earlier days, my father would drink and smoke weed with his cousins, pop pills, dabbled in coke a little. But when he met my mom, he stopped doing everything else bc she told him what was good. After being together for about a year and a half, I come along. I didnt notice my father was abusive until I had to witnessed his drunken rage myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Severe Anxiety because of the shit I endured at my fathers residence. Im not going into this topic any further. 

So, my bf and I have been together for 6 months and its been wonderful. Hes the most thoughtful and caring person Ive met, hes always the first one to lend a hand and reach out to people when they need. Before our relationship, he was with this girl for 3 years and she was extremely abusive to him. She had Epilepsy and when they were together, my bf took care of her. She would fake seizures just to laugh in his face when he reacted and she hit him while he was driving. After they broke up he told his parents and friends about what was going on. 

Now his father doesn't like this Ex, understandable. But my bfs Mother has no problems with her.

Now the best way I can describe my bfs mom is she always thinks shes right and does nothing wrong, she can make fun of and tease everyone but cant take it back, she must be waited on hand and foot whether shes demanding coffee, more food, or for my bf or his dad to drop what they're doing to assist her. My bfs parents own a business and she controls all of the finances. Everything is in her name. She constantly holds each weeks paycheck over my bfs head and then BARELY pays her own husband what hes owed at the end of the week ( which would be abt $550 every week, but he gets $100 allowance instead). She's verbally abusive to my bf calling him the most degrading names, i dont understand how someone could could tell their son that he's worthless and doesn't deserve shit bc hes standing up for himself when all he's doing is his job. 

One of the most recent things that happened was as my bf was doing his task, his mom interviens and ends up fucking up some business orders. Somehow everyone starts yelling at my bf for being ""too sensitive"" and ""not taking a joke"" when he was actually being insulted. I stood up for him and said he was just doing his job and trying to help and i was met with ""you stay out of this, none of your business, you don't need to defend our son."" 

BUT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT YOU BET YOUR ASS IM GOING TO DEFEND HIM. 

Because of corona, we have to stay with this vindictive bitch and its bringing back a lot of past trauma. we cant work rn bc she doesn't want us to be exposed to too many ppl.


My point in making this post was to put out there that if you're in a similar situation, you aren't alone. i'm slowly losing myself but i'm hanging on in hope we can get to our safe haven.","I (F19) am living with my bf (M21) and his family during quarantine, but hes not the abusive one.",indigenous-mermaid,2020-05-21 14:49:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gny7nv/i_f19_am_living_with_my_bf_m21_and_his_family/,0,1.0,1,19,581

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he‚Äôs so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn‚Äôt wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn‚Äôt see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn‚Äôt say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would‚Äôve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I‚Äôm like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn‚Äôt clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you‚Äôre so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he‚Äôs not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I‚Äôm never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn‚Äôt wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn‚Äôt even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he‚Äôs being so nasty, while he didn‚Äôt even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn‚Äôt been make sense and then hung up on me..

I felt terrible. My partner called me names at first and then said he was sorry and didn't blame me and he needed help. The police were looking for him but he went into hiding.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my fault. There a three sides to every story so I‚Äôll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn‚Äôt know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn‚Äôt know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn‚Äôt handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn‚Äôt think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole ‚ÄúI shall obey my husband‚Äù speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn‚Äôt care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn‚Äôt move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn‚Äôt he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn‚Äôt move.

He started yelling at me some more so I slapped him. He then started choking me and threw me on the floor. Eventually I just lay there and let him continue as in the past it always made him ease up. He did and let me go. I left the room and went to another room. He came to see me and started talking with me. Asking me why I keep letting this happen to us. I don‚Äôt know why I do. I don‚Äôt know I started the argument. I shouldn‚Äôt have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can‚Äôt get my words out is a very volatile situation for me. I tried my best to calm the situation but it seemed that he was trying to get me mad on purpose. He would ask me questions and I give him my honest answer and it never matters what I say, it‚Äôs wrong and I am being defiant. I guess I‚Äôm just frustrated with never being able to give a right answer to him to make him happy. Is this all my fault? Did I start it because I disagree with some of things he says and then kicked him when he pushed my buttons? I‚Äôm so confused.

domesticviolence,"I'm in a relationship that began a couple months ago. She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",Not entirely sure what to do,cleanedupmartian,2020-05-19 21:12:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmxevq/not_entirely_sure_what_to_do/,2,1.0,2,6,572
domesticviolence,"I‚Äôm at a loss about this. I‚Äôve been married to my husband 15 years. We‚Äôve been together 18 years. We rarely argue or fight but when we do, it‚Äôs pretty heated.  Well, last month, he became violent for the first time ever. 

He‚Äôs intensely stressed out with Covid as he‚Äôs a frontline physician in the hospital. He also has PTSD from the of death of his parents at a young age and they were alcoholics and fought all the time. So he gets anxious and panicky over the thought of loosing his family (I know no excuse) and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been most worried over with the pandemic is getting sick and dying or bringing it home to us and we get sick and die.

Anyway- during the fight he was screaming in my face that I‚Äôm a dumb bitch and stupid because I wasted $3 on the kids on Easter grass when we already had Easter grass and there‚Äôs millions of people without work, going to drive up food banks. He told me we had some and when I went out to get the Easter goodies, I bought it because I didn‚Äôt see any in the Easter box in storage. He admitted it wasn‚Äôt about the $3 grass but that I didn‚Äôt listen to him. I told him he was being abusive and needs to stop calling me names but he kept ranting. He finally got in my face with his finger pointing in my face swearing and yelling. I hit his hand away with my left hand (I‚Äôm right handed) and he ended up grabbing me by the hair and throwing me down and shaking me up and down  and threatened to kill me.  I know I should have walked away to my room but I didn‚Äôt.  The next day, I went to the ED to get X-rays because my clavicle hurt and I was concerned it might be broken. I had to drive out of state to get to a hospital that my health insurance would cover and that wasn‚Äôt his work place. I had bruises on me for 10 days after on my arms and fingers. 

He‚Äôs never made a threat to hurt me beyond threats to divorce me. He‚Äôs called me names before..maybe 3x since I‚Äôve ever known him and it never happened before we got married. I know I wouldn‚Äôt have married him if he had. My mother left my dad when I was 1.5 years old because he became violent with her so she raised me to not accept anything like that. I never been in a physically violent relationship before. 

I don‚Äôt trust him anymore. I don‚Äôt want to live a life walking on egg shells. I don‚Äôt see a lot changing.  He‚Äôs in a stressful job that he dislikes. He‚Äôs not hit the kids but he‚Äôs threatened our son and has gotten in his face threatening to knock his lights out to get him to do what he wants or to punish or scare him. Anyway‚Äî- does this sound like escalating abuse?

I keep researching  for stats on repeat offending because I suspect once someone crosses that line, it‚Äôs hard to not do it again. I realize it‚Äôs very much about being in control of us and he probably thinks he‚Äôs being protective of us. His friends have died or diagnosed with cancer etc and as we age, it‚Äôs just going to keep happening with the loss of friends etc and sensing our own mortality. I  don‚Äôt know if I can trust him ever again to be able to handle stress without getting so angry and violent. 

I don‚Äôt think he will harm me any time right now. But I‚Äôve started to take precautions just in case I need to leave quickly. I have a bag packed and in the car and the kids clothes packed. I changed my password in my phone. We long have had separate bank accounts.I have cash in a locked cabinet in my private office at work. So I think I‚Äôm good there. 

He tells me that he started to go to therapy at my insistence and I saw the insurance copay bill come in the mail so I know he attended an appt (TeleHealth) with the therapist at least once since then. But what‚Äôs the chances of him never doing this again? 

When he let go of me, he said ‚Äúhow many times have you hit me?‚Äù Which was totally to gaslight me. I‚Äôve never hit him before and he‚Äôs apparently taking me batting his hand out of my face as hitting him which is both concerning and manipulative when he was being aggressive.   The other thing that was concerning is when I asked him how his therapy session go and what did the therapist say, he responded with ‚Äúhe acted like it was the 20th tome he heard my story today‚Äù. I felt like he was trying to normalize and justify becoming abusive. 

So my questions are: 
(1) does this sound like the pattern or escalating abuse? 
(2) what are the chances of someone becoming physically violent again? I know this is a national emergency but still...",First time,MariaDV29,2020-05-19 05:12:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmi91b/first_time/,4,1.0,4,2,870

Hi all, I posted on here about a week ago about my abusive brother and the effects it had on me, some of these include PTSD, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism. Today I thought the same thing I‚Äôve questioned every day for years and finally decided to ask if anyone else can relate. Do you ever wonder who you would be if things were different? 

If I had a happy childhood would I be able to sleep at night without drinking until I black out? Would I be able to speak openly to my chosen family  who love me? Would I never have developed the fear that someone is always right behind me, breathing over my shoulder and watching me? Would I never have tried to slit my wrists or overdose on pills? Would I be able to get out of bed instead of lying there when the flashbacks overwhelm me?

domesticviolence,"I have never posted before and never thought this would be the reason for my first post. Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing. 

Now to last night. I'm dead asleep in bed, after 3 weeks of silence (but I'm still cooking for him, packing his lunches, etc) he charges in screams a bunch of stuff, one being I want a divorce. Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home. And everything is combined so there will have to be a lot of talking at some point. 

I don't expect anyone to read this whole long ass post but I'm scared, alone, and don't know what to do.

domesticviolence,"I feel like I was abused but I'm not sure if it was abuse or just something different.

I used to live in a house with the abusive stepfather, and abusive brother, AB is something like 24 and ASF is like 36. On numerous occasions AB has hit me, and choked me until I passed out and at one point he even tried to stab me, he missed his shot what was going towards my stomach but it slit my wrist and I still have that scar to this day, AB abuse was much more private and it only stayed inside of the house, however ASF was not bothered about abusing me in public. One time me and ASF were crossing this field where he choked me until I passed out and left me there stranded, in the middle of nowhere. Another time we were out shopping and ASF bought three bottles of washing up liquid and he forced me to drink one of them, like he shoved the cap inside of my mouth and would just keep squirting it inside of my mouth and if I spat it out he would punch me in the stomach, so I had no other choice but to swallow the washing up liquid.

Those were just a few times about my story and I just don't know whether it was abuse or just some sort of family joke thing.

domesticviolence,"This is kind of a dumb, minor thing, but I had a package arrive via UPS today for my ex. Its heavy and seems like it may be expensive.

I‚Äôve always returned it to sender but its been so draining having to continue seeing his name and take time to do this.

I have zero desire to make contact with him to get him this stupid package. I also resent the idea of simply taking it to the UPS store, as that feels like he gets to just continue controlling my behavior and making me cater to his whims, even though I ended things a year ago.

domesticviolence,"Hi,

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought.

domesticviolence,"So this started not too long ago, where he would ""jokingly"" raise his hand at me. I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn‚Äôt really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn‚Äôt like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I‚Äôve read that‚Äôs not a good idea.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/domestic-violence-2701824-Apr2016/?amp=1

And I really feel like the author of this piece.  I relate so much and our situations are so similar. 

I‚Äôm with someone who is mad all the time, Pissed off all the time. When he gets mad at me he yells at me, tells me to shut the fuck up, shut my mouth, I‚Äôm a b****, a c***, a hoe, pretty much every bad name you can call someone. Tells
Me how I‚Äôve let myself go and I‚Äôm just fat and lazy these days and not the girl he fell in love with. Accuses me of cheating on him. He gets so mad he gets in my face and puts a fist to my cheek and holds it there tightly and asks if I want to be punched in the mouth, or tells me if I don‚Äôt shut up he will punch he in the face. He shoves and restrains me sometimes. If I say we are over he grabs a gun and says he is going to go kill Himself And that no one cares if he dies. If I try to call The police he gets ENRAGED at me and says that I should not be involving the police, he will do whatever he can to get the phone from me. He is too strong and I do not stand a chance. 

Reading this I know it‚Äôs why not just leave him? Seems easy from the outside looking in. But I worry about him he really has some childhood trauma and some depression/ something undiagnosed that he won‚Äôt go get help for. He says he blacks out in rage and he is always saying he‚Äôs sorry for the things he does but then does them again. I really think he could have a better quality of life he went and got help. It makes me think maybe things can be fixed and the sweet warm funny person I knew before will come back. 

He just seems like he has lost his way. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like this. But I don‚Äôt want this to end in some huge battle royale. I just want him to be nice to me.

domesticviolence,"Hi,

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

domesticviolence,"I have been working with my local DV organization since the beginning of April. I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account. 

I am afraid something will happen to my cats because his sister (who is there not on the lease) has a history of animal abuse. What can I do? I'm afraid the police won't help me.


UPDATE:

It went abysmally. Despite being the primary on the lease I was denied entry to the home. It was bad enough his sister got in my mother's face and threatened her so I had to call the cops. I did record everything and got him admitting to both going through my email and making a copy as well as the landlord confirming the details of the abuse I had called and spoke with them about. I wanted to doe then and there.

Last year my state updated the law to include documentation from a mental health professional or a domestic violence advocate as accepted documentation to present your landlord to be allowed put of the lease without penalty. It was explained to me by my DV team that was to help people like me who got everything under the sun but a hand laid on them. Despite multiple attempts to reach out and educate my landlords, I am still going through a process with them allowing me to leave. It has escalated to the point the police and the DV attorneys are getting involved. None of that helps though when they disclosed all details I sent them to him. Because I had updated and added a 2-factor authentication to my email after I suspected he had access before. The details he was able to hurl at me had to have come from them.

The worst thing is the police told me that I have to wait until one or the other of us takes it to court to get my belongings. I tried to show proof of ownership but they wouldn't let me. Nor would they let me in the home for anything. And since he promises to sue me for defamation of character, all while parading the fact he is a jailer and is protected by the sheriff's office, I am having to prepare for the event he will actually have the guts to follow through. I think it would be incredibly stupid of him but yesterday proves that he is not above doing idiotic things in the name of hurting and humiliating me.

I voiced my concern and worry for my animals to the police and cited the fact she has been known to hurt them. They said it would still be a court matter. My advocate assured me they would do what they could since there was the possibility of animal abuse as well. I know him and his family and know that they're not above dumping or hurting the cats to make sure I cannot have them. I wasn't even able to see them yesterday as he hurled insults and claimed I abandoned them. I couldn't go back to get them until I was safe and had a plan. 

It is a mess and I have to go to work today and try to keep it together. My bosses know what vehicle down to the license plate to look out for because he intends to try to get me fired in an attempt to carry out an earlier threat to financially ruin me.

I (F20) have been with my current bf (M30) about 1.5 years. We have lived together for one, with both our names on the lease. 

He is everything I‚Äôd ever want and everything I fear at the same time. He cleans, does the washing and maintains the house, he works, has paid almost all the bills for the entire time we‚Äôve lived together (I‚Äôve had periods of unemployment) and even paid my insurance excess of ~$1000 when I was in a car accident. 

But he‚Äôs also a heavy drinker, like his father. His father can‚Äôt stand me, has compared me to Hitler and has on multiple occasions said I need to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and ‚Äústop being a spoilt little bitch‚Äù. I have been out with my friends 3 times since we got together, and on all but one occasion have been accused of cheating and told not to come home. In Jan 2020 he got so drunk he left a BBQ we were at and began walking home, only to cuss out my godfather and I when we went to pick him up. We left soon after and I took my thinks to a friends.m for the night. He left multiple voicemails from 30+ missed calls, detailing how he was going to kill me and smash up the house when he got home. He made it home and I wasn‚Äôt there so he slept on the couch, and promised to cut down. Another broken promise. 

When sober he tells me I‚Äôm the love of his life, when drunk he tell me he loves me but I‚Äôm x,y,z (expletive). I am the only one who drives, and he depends on me to get to work (he got this job shortly after we met from an advert I sent him) and I have driven him every day since. We have three cats, on of which is ‚Äúmine‚Äù, another ‚Äúhis‚Äù and a third is ‚Äúours‚Äù.

I am so afraid of leaving because of the constant mood changes and not knowing what will come next. He says my mood swings make him crazy but he stays with me because he loves me. He screams at me until I cry and then hugs me and says it‚Äôll be okay. He‚Äôs smashed my stuff and thrown things at me, but never hit me. 

I am so worn down I don‚Äôt know what to do. If I leave him he‚Äôll most likely go back to drugs and jail. He will lose his job because there is no other way to get to work before 7am, and I fear for the two cats that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmine‚Äù. 

Some people tell me to leave as soon as possible, others (my conservative family included) tell me to work harder on myself and things will get better. I‚Äôve gone back on my antidepressants and started therapy again. I‚Äôm working, and trying to function as best I can.

domesticviolence," I am in Texas. My ex (never married) and father of my 1 &amp; 2 year old daughters was arrested in March for Assault Family Violence - Choking/Impeding breath after suffocating me with his hands during an argument. We were laying in bed and after some insults back and forth he rolls over on top me (I was laying sideways - facing away from him) and screams ""BBBIIITTTCCCHHHH!!!"" as loud as he possibly could directly in my ear - his lips were touching my ear, I elbow him off me (mind you - the babies are sleeping in the rooms next door) and that's when he climbs on top of me, grabs my wrists and pins my hands behind my back with all of his body weight, I couldn't move my hands. He puts one hand over my mouth and then the other over my nose. I start to panic and I realized what was going on. I look up and his eyes were completely black and as if there was no soul. I thought 'this is it, I'm going to die.' I knew he wasn't there. Everything started to go black and then I remember feeling his hands moving down to my neck - he had let go but wasn't done with me!!! This is when I'm able to swing myself with all of my might, out from under him and off the bed. I was freaking the f out. We live in a two story home with all the bedrooms upstairs. I run down the stairs where my phone is and call 911. I WAS TERRIFIED. Hysterical. Not only did he almost just kill me, he looked possessed- those eyes- he was still upstairs where our babies were sleeping!! I thought he was going to kill my daughters. I really fucking did. This is actually the first time I've written this out (other than the victim statement on the police report) and it's kind of therapeutic as I am being gaslighted about the entire incident by my abuser. Anyways, I'll make the rest of this short and sweet... there was a protective order for 61 days and a CPS investigation following the incident.

He admitted when he was released from jail (his mom bailed him out from NY) that he did not remember anything (I knew he wouldn't - his eyes) so I re-capped what happened. He cried, begged, pleaded, promised to never drink again, scared of his mind and questioning his own insanity for not remembering what he did to me, saying he needs help. Fast forward 2 weeks into the protective order (he's staying with a friend) and I find out through some snooping that he has lawyered up ($15k) to fight this charge. None of this is expressed to me as I'm meeting him with the girls at the park - to see Daddy. I never had any intention of getting back with him, I'm done, I love my children more than I love him but you would think that he would communicate with me on whats going on with him legally/medically in a case like this as pertaining to the father of my daughters in domestic violence - UNLESS he was trying to stay quiet so I wouldn't cooperate with prosecution. I bring it up and he goes straight to rage - saying I made the whole thing up and that if this goes to court, everyone will see what really happened. Um, what the fuck? I stop the park visits

So now here I am. I have an appointment with a local DV advocate tomorrow morning. My ex has a laundry list of alcohol abuse convictions - 2 DWI's in NY, 1 in TX and 1 PI in TX. He's 32. I'm not trying to bring a man to his knees as far as the assault charge goes, I will cooperate with prosecution but my main concern is the children - custody.

My question is: Are the alcohol abuse/DWI convictions enough to deem him unfit? In which I would request supervised visitation until/unless he enters treatment and then we can re-evaluate. Or do I need to hire an attorney and make sure he is prosecuted for the domestic violence case in order to to protect my children from this man if he doesn't/until he gets the help he needs?",Child Custody - Pending Domestic Violence Case,elbre3628,2020-05-14 05:42:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gjg8yo/child_custody_pending_domestic_violence_case/,1,1.0,5,7,724

domesticviolence,"We were sitting in the living room watching a movie when I heard a sound as if she got hit or pushed. That shock/hurt-sound that your body can‚Äôt help but make when something physical happens.

When one of us went up to check on them she barged out of her room really tense and started yelling or being really sharp with everyone over some old housemate forgetting to pay rent over a year ago. It was weird and I‚Äôm worried.

‚Äî‚Äî-
Backstory feel free to skip: They‚Äôve been together for four months and have not slept a single night apart. They‚Äôre referring to each other as ‚Äúthe love of their lives‚Äù. She‚Äôs so lovely and beautiful inside and out. He doesn‚Äôt have any friends but her, and ever since they started dating she‚Äôs let all of her friendships fade. 

He‚Äôs not able to communicate or connect with anyone but her. Everyone that meets him all curiously enough describe him in the same-ish way ‚ÄúI like the guy, I just don‚Äôt want to hang out with him‚Äù. And recently we‚Äôve noticed that he mansplains everything to her. I‚Äôm mindful that that can just be part of their relationship dynamic ‚Äúnaughty girl and daddy‚Äù whatever but the other day she bought me flowers and he shook his head at tsk-ed ‚Äúoh honey no...‚Äù at the way she cut the flowers. And now we‚Äôre all noticing that he does this all the time...

I just... something‚Äôs off. And she has changed dramatically since they started dating. She doesn‚Äôt take care of herself, she‚Äôs failing uni, she‚Äôs being short with us housemates, she never sees her friends. She has always prided herself on being kind to animals, but ever since he moved in they‚Äôve both started yelling really aggressively at her dog to the point t that the dog is now super anxious. (I told him to please stop yelling at her when I caught him slapping the dogs head and screaming ‚Äúno‚Äù over and over again)

They‚Äôre moving out in ten days to an apartment of their own. It all feels rushed as we‚Äôre in the middle of a global pandemic and she just got laid off her job and he has told me that he‚Äôs used most of his savings. The new apartment is four times the total of what they‚Äôre paying now..

domesticviolence,"This is my throwaway account for safety.

I‚Äôve known this guy for the past 4 years and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more stressed by anyone than him

He wanted to be a ‚Äúpsychonaut‚Äù aka he wanted to do every drug he could get his hands on. Coke, whippits, sooner or later lsd, shrooms. I don‚Äôt have a problem with those things in and of themselves, but he was taking it way too far.
Every single day he was doing something. 

Within the last year I have seen him go completely psychotic, it started with depression, and then it would get to suicide attempts all the time. He would use it to force her to come over. They would get into an argument, he‚Äôd try to kill himself, she would be forced to go and save him. It happens so much that recently he was attempting to kill himself and she was in the room with him. He has convinced her this is what is best. 

He constantly uses his mental health and his addictions as ways to keep her with him. 

Not only is he psychologically abusive to her, he is psychologically abusive to animals as well. ANY time he sees a dog, he chases after them, yells at them, holds them into fans, anything to scare them as much as he can, and he constantly laughs about it too. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where no one invites him places cause once he starts he can‚Äôt stop. He was bitten by one of the most tame dogs I‚Äôve ever met when no one was looking. He fucks with them so much that even people that resemble him make the dogs extremely nervous. I cut ties with him once this first started around 5 months ago, but it still goes on to this day.

He constantly goes on rants and makes jokes about murder, and he talks about murdering his ex all the time. He makes school shooter jokes about himself and when people tell him not to joke about it, he says ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt be as funny when it actually happens‚Äù and then continues to laugh, even though it makes everyone uncomfortable. 

Same with the dogs, no one likes it, everyone is uncomfortable, and everyone try‚Äôs to make him stop, but he just doesn‚Äôt.

He has been put in suicide watch twice and both times he got out early because he knows how to talk his way out of it. 

A couple days ago they went on a break. Not 2 days later she went back to his place. It feels like there is nothing she can do about this situation. It seems like he‚Äôs constantly on the verge of snapping and actually physically hurting things and she is the only one who can hold him back. And I think she knows this too, and that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt leave. She is clearly going downhill mentally as well, she has ptsd pretty bad and she never seems happy for longer than a minute at a time.

I want to be there for her and get her out of that situation but I‚Äôm concerned for my own safety at this point. I‚Äôm scared of being with her in case he does snap and decides to go where she is. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do about any of this. It doesn‚Äôt make since to me at all. Almost everyone has cut him out, I only talk/hang out with her when I know he can‚Äôt be around. I feel like the best action for myself is to just distance myself from all of it. I‚Äôve tried to talk with her about it so much that i feel like a record player. But I need to be there for her through this. She needs to know that there are people who are there for her but it‚Äôs so hard to show that when he is constantly making her come over. 


What pisses me off about all of this is that he constantly puts all this pressure on her, and the moment that she can‚Äôt take it and tries to leave, he is the nicest person in the world. I hate how quickly he switches. It just shows to me that he thinks he can do whatever he wants and then pretend to be all lovey and pretend none of it happend. I don‚Äôt understand.

domesticviolence,"My ex boyfriend got arrested recently for domestic violence. It's been hard to process. He doesn't take responsibility for his actions. He thinks I ruined his life over nothing. He's lied about me in court and I feel sick thinking about all the horrific and untrue things his family must think about me. The night he was arrested he scared me more than anything, and my injuries were mild. They were so mild that he's trying to explain them away as him just restraining my crazy, using no unneeded force. 

I think if he had never been arrested I wouldn't have ever labelled myself as a victim. For some reason that label is difficult to accept. But I keep thinking back on all the screwed up things he's done to me in the past, and there were a few times I think I should have called the police but I didn't. And there was so much gaslighting. I thought I was going crazy and it was terrifying. The gaslighting was affecting me even after the arrest, and I kept wondering if I deserved what he did to me, or if I blew up something that should have been nothing. 

It feels terrible. It makes me feel alone. And I know there are so many people who have been through very similar things, but I keep thinking about his ex wife. I've never met her, and he didn't talk about her much. What I have heard has been all bad. But I never wondered about her much until after he got arrested and I started to process the fact that he's an abuser. 

I've never heard anything about abuse allegations in the past and he's never been convicted of anything that I can find. But I still keep thinking about her and wondering if he ever hurt her. I want to know what he did to her. I think it's the emotional abuse making me question if I even have the right to call myself a victim, and if there's someone else out there who understands what he put me through, who has been a victim of his same methods of abuse, who knows without a question that this specific person is garbage, I would feel better. It would make me stop questioning myself and what happened to me in the ways that I have been. 

I found her online and I want to talk to her but I'm not going to. I wouldn't have any idea what to say, and I would be afraid he would find out.

domesticviolence,"I keep hearing screams and other concerning things through the walls from my neighbor's apartment. There will be banging, and a woman (or maybe child?) screaming. I've heard a man shouting. The only two phrases I heard him say clearly were:

""On your knees, get on your fucking knees,"" and ""You want some more of this? Huh?""

Is this domestic violence? What if I'm wrong?

The first few times it happened, I brushed it off as TV sounds or a kid throwing a tantrum. But recently I saw my neighbor trying to shut the door on her boyfriend while begging him to leave. He pushed his way back inside, shut the door, then I heard screaming again. I called the police, but when they arrived my neighbor told them everything was fine. 

I've called the police a few times since this because I heard screaming again. Every time, my neighbor tells them everything is fine and gets super pissed about the cops ""wasting"" her time. She's a black single mother who's clearly struggling, and is none too fond of cops poking into her business. Last time, she almost got in a fight with one of the officers.

My question is this: Should I keep calling the police when I hear stuff through the walls? Is this a no-win situation?

If she is being abused, I feel like I could be making it worse. If she's not being abused, I'm needlessly harassing this poor woman who's just trying to raise her kids in peace. I'm also low-key scared she or her boyfriend might kick my ass, because she knows I'm the one calling the cops. 

I feel awful either way, and I keep wondering if I'm just that racist Karen who calls the cops every time her neighbors raise their voices. I smoke a lot of weed and watch a lot of true crime, so I don't 100% trust my judgement, but I'm pretty sure what I heard/saw. And she has little kids, so the stakes are that much higher.

domesticviolence,"Sorry for the long post, I have no one to talk to...

Some of my (21F) earliest memories are of being physically and emotionally abused by my oldest brother. He is 8 years older than me so there was very little I could do as a kid to defend myself. He had, and still does to this day, an extremely explosive temper that can be set off by the smallest things. As a result of the abuse I have severe depression, anxiety, and frequent PTSD flashbacks of him hitting me, suffocating me with pillows, holding me down and burning me with lighters, holding knives to my throat, etc. When I was younger he always told me that if I ever said anything about the abuse to my parents that he would ‚Äúslit my throat in my sleep‚Äù and I believed him so I kept my mouth shut for years. Last May I graduated college and accepted a job across the country from where I grew up and decided I would be far enough from him that I wouldn‚Äôt need to be scared anymore, so I got the courage to talk to my parents about the abuse. The conversation did not go well. My parents said if things were really that bad then I would have told them or they would have noticed. The thing is.....they did know a lot of it. 

When I was 6 they called the cops on him after coming home from work to find a welt on my face in the shape of his hand. When the police arrived they put him in handcuffs but my mother started crying and begged them to let him go. They did. The next day he suffocated me with a pillow until I almost blacked out. 

When I was 10 he held a knife to my mom‚Äôs throat and slammed her into a wall. My dad came up from behind him, wrestled the knife from his hands, and they got into a fist fight that my dad eventually won.

When I was 12 he chased me with a baseball bat threatening to ‚Äúbash my head in‚Äù. I reached the family RV in the driveway and locked myself inside. He hit the door with the bat over and over again, screaming the whole time about how much he wanted to kill me. When my parents got home they saw the damage to the RV and asked me what happened. I told them he got angry. They grounded him.

My parents still deny that they knew the extent of what was happening to me, but I find that hard to believe. Even after all of that I still want to have a relationship with them. The thing is, they want me to have a relationship with my abuser. Because he‚Äôs their child too they can‚Äôt stand that I won‚Äôt have a relationship with him. I can‚Äôt talk to my parents without them bringing him up and asking if I‚Äôll talk to him. When I was visiting them they even invited him over for dinner without telling me until he was there. I had a panic attack and cried in the bathroom but had no way of leaving, so I was forced to sit and eat across the table from him. 

Does anyone else have an abuser for a sibling? Do you still keep in contact with your family? Or if anyone just wants to leave any general comments here I would appreciate it. I feel so alone, like I‚Äôll never have a family.

domesticviolence,"I live in Washington State. Yesterday my apartment complex neighbors were screaming at each other with their window open. My window was closed, but didn't do much to drown out the noise. I called the police after the woman began yelling ""don't hurt me"" and ""don't touch me."" I heard things shattering and three loud slapping noises in a row. She was loudly crying.

Here's the other part where legal advice comes in...the police came. From what I could hear from my window (all of it, whether I wanted to or not) they found broken things, blood everywhere, and the man was cut on the face. I'm not sure if they took the woman to another room to ask questions, but it sounded like she was there, just not involved in the conversation. They questioned the man repeatedly, but he refused to admit what happened; although after being pushed by the cops saying ""did she hit you"" enough times he said yes, only to repeatedly deny it again. The cop kept calling him the victim and they took her to jail.

I don't know how his face got cut, but based on what I heard, I was shocked by this decision. I understand the WA State domestic violence law states the police must arrest the individual who is deemed the primary aggressor. He was the one apparently covered in blood, but the cop didn't (seem to) ask the woman what happened. Seems like a self defense act to me. I saw him drag her across the floor and slap her, I heard her yell ""stop"", I heard her cry. They were both yelling ""I hope you die"" at each other, both calling each other worthless.

How can I get involved as a witness? It would be unacceptable for her to serve jail time and him get off scotch free, when he was, from my witness perspective, absolutely the primary aggressor. I told the cops to come knock on my door because I have info and they said they would but never did.

I also have a video and I could use advice on the legality of that. According to the WA State Legislature, recordings can be used in a court of law if...

""(a) of an emergency nature, such as the reporting of a fire, medical emergency, crime, or disaster, or (b) which convey threats of extortion, blackmail, bodily harm, or other unlawful requests or demands, or (c) which occur anonymously or repeatedly or at an extremely inconvenient hour, or (d) which relate to communications by a hostage holder or barricaded person as defined in RCW¬†70.85.100""

I could argue that the recording falls into the category of both crime and bodily harm, but does that give me to right to have/use this recording? Is it even safe to admit I have it...? I already told the police I do, so I've got nothing to lose on that front at this point.

domesticviolence,"Last fall, my previously stable, however depressed, (soon to be ex) husband experienced a psychotic break and attempted to strangle me to death in my sleep. I fought like hell, armed myself, make a plan, and got the fuck outta there with help from friends and family and now reside out of state. For the past 8 months, I‚Äôve been trying to rebuild my love through counseling and advancing my career. I did press charges for what happened and my husband was given a year probation and tons of court ordered treatment due to his severe mental illness and addiction concerns. That being said, he isn‚Äôt getting the best treatment in the pandemic situation. Predictably, he again experienced another episode and hasn‚Äôt slept in days. In sounds like the same delusions and accusations cane up with the woman he was dating, and thankfully for her she fled before he hurt her. Now last night he continues to unravel, posting crazy things on Facebook and accusing her of insane stuff on a public forum. Turns into this woman‚Äôs friends posting my ex‚Äôs charges which show my initials, the no contact order, and outline what happened to me. When I left, I wanted to do so quietly due to my profession and feeling humiliated and scared. Now everything is out and the open and it feels like the event is happening all over again.

I have been in and out of therapy after what my ex did to me. I will list a few bullet points so that I don't ramble, (something I have a habit of doing). 

* He would spike my drinks with amphetamines (Meth to Americans) to keep me addicted to drugs. 
* He would shake me to make me have seizures. 
* He would beat me up when I had angered him.
* He would slap me round the face when he thought I got too loud. 
* He sexually assaulted me many times when I was too drunk or high to consent. 
* He wouldn't let me go out of the house on my own. 
* He wouldn't let me dress how I wanted. 
* Would say that we were going out to dinner, watch me get dressed up and then humiliate me in front of his coke head friends when I was trying to be beautiful. 
* Beat me up and spiked my drinks when I was trying to battle my addiction. (I'm 7 years clean now with few relapses) 
* He would steal money from me. 
* When I had an overdose he refused to take me to a hospital which lead to my dealer looking after me for about 2 weeks while I got better. 
* Trashed my house.
* Smashed my face into a window. 
* Threatened me with knives.
* Let his friends push me over so they could humiliate me. 
* Caused fights between me and other girls by bringing out my inner psychopath. (I have since apologised to most of these girls as it wasn't their fault and I was in the wrong for taking the bait)

And just yesterday, after years of talking about him to my therapist. I revealed his name and asked him to report him on behalf of me because, in all honesty I am scared to report it myself. 

My mum has been no help, she told me to forget about it because nothing will help me and I am just being a psycho. She is still friends with his mum and said I shouldn't report him cause his mum is so nice. 

It has been 6 years since I was last in the same room as him and he regularly stalks me and tries to find out where I live. He did this 3 years ago when I lived with an African housemate and for the first time in my life, someone stepped in to stop his abuse when the African guy went outside and confronted him and when my ex called him a (I'm sorry for this language) a ""Dirty N-word"" the African guy beat his ass and told him not to come round again. And he didn't. 

However, I have since moved again and him and his mates are trying to find me because they found out that I was coming forward with my abuse story and they basically want me gone.

domesticviolence,"I really can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt see it coming, it‚Äôs been escalating steadily for a few months. We used to have disagreements and conversations about it. That became shouting matches and then it became him just yelling at me with increasingly vulgar language. Then it became him physically shoving me aside to walk away. Then just pushing me back (hard) to express his anger.

Anyway, two days ago he finally hit me. I‚Äôm 35 and I‚Äôve never been hit by anyone before. I assumed that if he hit me, he would slap or punch my face. Instead, he punched my stomach. I‚Äôm trying really hard to describe just how bad the pain was. It was like a sharp impact and then burning hot pain. I couldn‚Äôt breathe no matter how hard I tried and I don‚Äôt even remember falling, but my legs gave out and I was basically curled up on the floor. I had the worst stomach cramps and nausea I‚Äôve ever experienced, I‚Äôm just grateful that I had barely eaten anything that day because even so, I so badly felt like hurling everything up. I did manage to crawl to the bathroom and spent a half hour heaving with absolutely nothing to bring up.

Two days later, I‚Äôm cramping and hurting every time I breathe. I haven‚Äôt eaten a thing, firstly because of the pain and secondly because I keep thinking of what if he hits me there again. My body feels completely violated. I can‚Äôt stop feeling incredibly vulnerable knowing that all it took was a single punch to mess me up so badly.

I had a domestic situation last week, I feel like I've told this story to a hundred people, authorities, work, therapist.

Basically spouse went into a rage and destroyed our bedroom door in pieces, it is a cheap door.

He threatened suicide and screamed at me to come into the woods.

We escaped safely with the clothes on our back.

We lived in a hotel for a week and had to flee to a shelter today because he showed up at my work, scared everyone (they knew beforehand and had safety plans in place, everyone is okay)

He has a VPO but has yet to be served.

We have no car, lost our food and now are experiencing some hardships.

I have 2 friends co-workers (who are probably scared now) and no family.

I am so angry and partially scared.

I never would have thought in a million years that I would have to hide from this monster.

I feel shame for bringing it to work and angry for him for what he's done.

My work was all I had and now he's crossed the line. 

Because he hasn't been served, he hasn't violated a VPO.

domesticviolence,"Honest to God, I understand why my exes beat me.

The real question is why *doesn‚Äôt* my current boyfriend hit me?

I‚Äôm an awful girlfriend, really and truly.¬†

I‚Äôm often distant or uncommunicative, and I make really bitchy comments constantly, not that I mean to. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm programmed to literally be a cunt. I can‚Äôt think for myself, I nag for things to get done, I veto things that would make my partner happy if I don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ And I can all-around and admittedly be a fucking bitch.

I‚Äôve been working on trying to filter the things I say, as my boyfriend has pointed out to me more recently that sometimes I act bitchy out of nowhere and for no reason; he didn‚Äôt say this in a spiteful sense, he wanted to make sure I was okay.

It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand it.¬†

Today, we were out for a walk and I made a bitchy comment. He was talking about how he wishes he could exercise at home, but can‚Äôt due to all his commitments, and I jokingly said ‚Äúsucks to be you.‚Äù I genuinely think I‚Äôm being playful or like a cute-nagging kind of thing; it‚Äôs after the fact I realize how bad what I said is.¬†

He seemed really offended, but in my head I was joking, so I thought it was okay. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of how my words were hurtful and could have affected him.¬†

I then made a joke as we kept walking about how one thing that really sucks with coronavirus is that I can‚Äôt go up and pet people‚Äôs dogs anymore. He said, ‚Äúsucks to be you,‚Äù and dropped my hand. He cracked his knuckles, which is why I thought he stopped holding my hand.¬†

However, he never grabbed it again. He walked further away from me, faster than I can, and didn‚Äôt respond when I talked.¬†

In the silence, I realized that I did it again. What I said really and genuinely was mean and I feel bad. The thing is, I haven‚Äôt apologized yet. I‚Äôm going to after I finish writing this, but I‚Äôm throwing myself a small pity party and wanted to articulate something I‚Äôve felt for a while now.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because my boyfriend is the first person I‚Äôve ever loved or this is such a great relationship or what‚Ä¶ But sometimes I wonder why he doesn‚Äôt beat the everliving shit out of me. It must be hard dating me, and even worse, I live with him. He can‚Äôt escape me.

In my head, I picture any ex hitting me, and I remember the pain I felt in those moments versus the pain I feel now. The pain back then? It was nothing. I feel awful I‚Äôve hurt my boyfriend, and I can‚Äôt handle the emotional pain. Emotions are very hard to deal with for me.

domesticviolence,"So I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place but I really need some advice because I haven‚Äôt gotten legal advice that is reassuring. This is going to be a long one. 

So, two years ago, my ex fianc√© and I were having a discussion in the kitchen about finances to which it seemed he was getting frustrated about and in the middle of that, heard my 9 month old daughter cry out (she did that when she wanted to have more milk) and so I had to leave him and went to breastfeed her. I went in and laid down on my bed beside her and she started nursing. Soon after, my ex fianc√© came in, said something that made him seem super off, dragged me down off the bed by my hair and shoulders, and pinned me to the ground. He had his whole body on top of me, forcing my legs and shoulders down and then tried strangling/suffocating me. By the grace of god, he got off me after a couple of minutes and started screaming and running around, and I ended up getting out of there. 
I called the police and reports and photographs were taken. Two years later, and the court process is still ongoing, and he is set to go to trial on June 19th. I am to be there as well as he is pleading not guilty. 
For more information about him, I will also like to add that he is a heavy drinker and the night this happened, he had no money and not had any alcohol for a couple of days. He also smoked marijuana every night. I can‚Äôt help but think he was withdrawing because didn‚Äôt have any drinks or weed since he had no money and maybe that caused him to rage like he did? I don‚Äôt know. 

As you could imagine, I was very hurt and traumatized by this happening to me. I truly thought I was going to die that night. My ex is on conditions in which he can‚Äôt have any contact with me unless it‚Äôs through a lawyer. Although my child was in the room, and was sitting up in the bed crying after he ripped me off her from nursing, there are no conditions made between them.  It took me a couple of months to decide that my daughter could sometimes be in her grandmothers care (his moms) and my daughter would be with her 100% of the time. I told them that my daughters father was allowed to be there so that he could be a part of my daughters life, but couldn‚Äôt be alone with her. I didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt feel comfortable with him being alone with her because he has not acknowledged any of his issues/addiction and hasn‚Äôt gotten any help for anything. I‚Äôm afraid he could hurt her, especially in spite of me.
Since we‚Äôre expected to quarantine because of COVID, I told his mom I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with my daughter going there while this is all happening. She told me she understood and I offered to FaceTime if she ever wanted. My decision for that was that there are 3 adults in that household who could potentially be exposed to COVID. I don‚Äôt leave my place and so no there‚Äôs no chance of exposure. I am doing this because I am trying to keep her safe, and not purposely keeping her from him.  

So what gets very confusing for me is that I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs okay for me to be keeping my daughter this whole time without seeing her father, when there is still an ongoing court case for the assault, and I still am not comfortable and likely never will be, to allow him be with my daughter because of his addiction and anger issues. 
I feel like I just don‚Äôt understand what my rights are with having my child in my care, even when COVID wasn‚Äôt a thing, given my circumstances. 

We were never married. He has not requested visitation or anything so  am I allowed to have her only in my care then?
I think I just need some reassurance or some clarity! 

Thank you.

EDIT - MORE INFO:

So, I do have a lawyer for family law issues. Our lawyers are trying to come to some sort of agreement right now. I was trying for a separation agreement in which my daughter will be in my care and he could continue seeing her while in his Mother‚Äôs care. I have always allowed her to go see them when they asked unless we already had plans. I always tried to make sure he maintained the role and relationship with her. He is trying for joint custody and so this is ongoing. There is nothing that my lawyer said that I‚Äôm not happy with. I think I‚Äôm just a bit confused as to what my rights are while waiting on the court case for the assault to occur. It seems, with my lawyer, as if it‚Äôs okay for me to have her in my care right now, as her safety is of best interest. From what I understand, that is fine and in order for her to have her, he would have to apply for visitation rights or something.

domesticviolence,"This post is meant to serve as a warning from all the love in my heart to any of you who are still with your abuser.

My homegirl was like a sister to me. We did both have our own issues that created conflict in our friendship before my abuser came along, but he was ultimately the problem that caused us to fallout for 2 years. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave him, she exhausted herself trying to help me, and we were both so hurt by each other we both made the decision to almost completely cut each other off. 
The end of our friendship left me incredibly hurt, as I was cut off from many of our mutual friends, as most people sided with her. 

Now fast forward to about 1.5 years since we had put our friendship on hold, my abuser and I have been no contact for 7 months. I had been more like a better version of myself at the time my sister and I had first become friends. I‚Äôve been happier, more responsible, and completely drama free. I had missed her and began to think about reaching out. I had realized the many ways I was unknowingly toxic to her while I was under the spell of an absolute trash bag of a ‚Äúman‚Äù. But since the way things had ended, and since I was still hurt in many ways by her, a mixture of pride and a fear of rejection prevented me from contacting her. I did not feel as though it was my place to initiate contact, and also felt I was owed an apology simultaneously.

Then I find out this past Monday, she passed away from a common heart condition that nobody knew she had. Because of the hospitals being overwhelmed by covid 19, her symptoms which she had been having since the end of April, were deemed not serious enough to require an immediate appointment. Her given appointment was for Tuesday afternoon, she collapsed in her apartment Monday morning. EMS was called, I was told she was lucid and panicked when EMS arrived, fighting them and had to be taken forcefully. She did not want to go. Then she seized in the ambulance on the way to the ER. Once in the ER, she was intubated and then went into cardiac arrest and left us. Two of our friends were with her at the hospital, they were not in the room when she passed but saw her after. She was taken away from us too soon and I am completely heartbroken.

Even though we both distanced each other, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we were like sisters and shared a rare and incredible love for each other. Our bond was sacred and was pretty much completely broken by my abuser. 

So I want to repeat what is often said here, somebody who intentionally hurts you physically, sexually, and emotionally does not love you. Making excuses to stay, and letting yourself believe that you don‚Äôt have a choice leads you to where I am right now. They will leave you with nothing but pain, lost time and lost love. I honestly had never thought of ‚ÄúWhat if she were to die?‚Äù while I was continually choosing my abuser over our friendship and I want all of you who reads this to really think about that because we are all in each others shoes here. Try to do more than you think you can do to heal yourself and break away from abuse, stop with the excuses and shoot for the stars. Because you never ever know what could possibly happen to the people who really love you. I will be praying for the warrior within all of us.

Our son came into our bedroom and he yelled at his dad to stop, which worked and I was able to back away from him. After he let me go I was going to call my mother-in-law to come pick me up. Unfortunately I‚Äôm much closer with his family than I am my own. On top of that I‚Äôm the only person in my family that still lives city I grew up in. He found me trying to call his mom and told me to stop, I just went with whatever he said because I didn‚Äôt wanna be choked again. I have marks on my throat where his hands were my jaw is swollen it almost looks like I had a wisdom tooth taken out. The rash/burn on my neck stings every time I turn my head. 

We‚Äôve been together for 10 years and he‚Äôs never done anything remotely close to what happened.

domesticviolence,"I'm unsure if what I experience at home is considered domestic violence. I often receive slaps at home; sometimes playful, sometimes passionate, and mostly intended to harm. Since I was young, I noticed that my parents fought regularly, and when they did, there was hell to pay. My parents immigrated from India to the United States, and from my understanding, it is fairly common to discipline your child through a raising of the hand, or broom/sandals in an extreme case. I am fortunate to have never received the latter.

When my parents fought, a good portion involves screaming, and it, thankfully, rarely reaches the stage of hurting one another. There was one time, however, that juts out clearly in my mind. My parents had an argument once last year that resulted in the scalp of my mother's head to bleed a little. I don't think I uttered more obscene words to my father, or anyone I've encountered, on that day.

I often retaliate against my parents when I do get slapped, which is pretty much every day at this point. When I was in elementary school, I had to sign a slip for poor behavior one day. I decided to forge the signature because I was too peeved to actually give the slip to my parents. When my teacher read the slip, she asked if it was actually my parent's signature. I told her the truth about the slip, but she seemed insistent to know the reason why. I eventually gave her one out of instinctive fear, and I told her that I was afraid of being slapped by my parents. In the moment, I think I thought that I was shifting the blame and felt extremely guilt because of it, but it's apparent that there was an underlying fear to the words I said. I have instinctively learned to shift the blame, as both my father and mother often do in our household.

I also often manage to get myself into arguments with my parents because, as a 13 year old teenager living in a modern-day society: I have nothing better to do. It doesn't help matters that the globe is facing a pandemic crisis that has left us in quarantine and stuck in the indoors, where I am rendered useless and have lost a good amount of motivation at this point. (I gained a good 5 pounds in weight.)

I hate the fact that I am pronouncing this fact to the Internet, but I sometimes feel that I deserve the slaps I receive. The majority of the arguments, if not all, are concerning the fact that I am lazy piece of shit and a good-for-nothing. It's unsurprising that my ego certainly doesn't agree.

There are many issues surrounding themselves in our home, but I have never formally addressed these issues aloud. I think, deep down, I know the answer, but I will never attempt to admit these facts to myself until someone else validates them, yet another issue with myself and my household. I am aware that I am speaking with quite a frustrated and angst-y tone, and it may come off as behaving in a false/fabricated manner, but I can't seem to find it in myself to really care, a defense mechanism I haven't gotten quite accustomed to over the years. Despite these issues, I really do love my parents and am willing to sacrifice my life for them. We continue to ignore the deep-rooted issues, but I know the good times are unforgettable and surreal, even.

If you are willing to give your raw and unfiltered opinion on the situation, I would want nothing more than to hear it.",I don't know if what I experience at home is domestic violence.,cynxcalgxrl,2020-05-10 01:35:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggsay9/i_dont_know_if_what_i_experience_at_home_is/,2,0.67,2,12,607

domesticviolence,"(I put this in the relationships subreddit, but they told me to put it here so...)

Hello! I don't know if I'm too late, but I need help with something urgently. I've [20F] been stuck in the house with my family members [Father: 63M, Mother: 50F, Brother: 24M, Sister: 33F] during the Corona virus and it's horrible. My father is what makes it horrible most of all, but my brother has his infractions too. Most of my life, my father has been abusive. Most of the time it wasn't physical, it was verbal and any other form of emotional abuse. He would constantly spread lies about my mother (most of it was projecting his horrible deeds onto her), he would run around the house trying to pick fights with my other family members, and he would be very particular about people touching his things when he has all our government records and he tries to (and sometimes exceeds at) open all our letters. 

Anyways...today my mother was trying to look through his documents to find her high school diploma because she needs it to renew her license and he kept telling when she asked him to look for it that he doesn't have it. Though, she knows that he's the one that has it. He came upstairs to her room to walk in on her looking through his stuff because she needed her diploma to show the DMV course in 2 days. He started yelling at her ""I told you I didn't have it! Why are you going through my stuff!! Get out of here before I kill you!!! I will do the time!"". She yelled back at him ""I need my diploma! I know you have it! I gave it to you!"" A few minutes later he called me upstairs in order to stop her, but that wasn't a good idea on his part because I just tried to bargain with him to let my mother search through his stuff for her diploma. When he had enough of me, he lifted up a chair in the bedroom and started charging towards me, he chased me down the hall; I ran away into the bathroom before he can hit me. I started yelling at him that if he threw the chair at me that I'll call the police. He eventually calmed down.

Oh, and last week, my father found drugs in my brother's room after me and my mom were trying to convince my father my brother was clean because we honestly thought he was clean. It was weed which isn't a big deal, but the last time he started smoking weed it led him to do harder drugs and led him to start doing crimes. Also, it was the amount you have to sell, not to consume all on your own. I have another brother[30M], but he's locked up. He told us that we should believe my father. I don't believe my father most of the time because his lying is pathological most of the time.

Tbh, I know I'll do what I've always done to cope to get through and I'm doing everything I can to move out as quickly as possible because my mother would never leave him due to divorce being an abomination amongst most West Africans (I'm in America btw, don't want to cause confusion). I just can't help but to step in when my father is mean to my mother and brother even though my cousin told me to not get involved in their drama because it's holding me back from fully focusing on my future. Am I wrong for getting involved in their drama? If so, do you have advice on how I can stop myself from doing it? Should I go to my Uncle and Aunt's house for the next few nights? I'm really nervous to ask them if I could stay in their house because they would ask too many questions.

TLDR: My father is abusive, mostly in a non-physical way and my brother is a drug addict that was caught with selling stash of soft drugs (weed) and drug paraphernalia. I know how to cope and am currently trying to make enough money to move out on my own, I just need advice on how to not let their issues distract me from my work and school. Thank you!","My [20F] Father [63M] is abusive and my brother [24M] is turning to drugs again, I feel extremely sad and I need advice.",DistractionCitron,2020-05-09 21:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggoctt/my_20f_father_63m_is_abusive_and_my_brother_24m/,1,1.0,1,23,725
domesticviolence,"I (30M) moved to Germany in July 2018 in hope for a new life and aspirations to live and work in Europe. I made a really good friend (girl) and thought that she had a heart of gold. We grew close together as we had a lot in common and bonded (regular friends, no sex). After a few weeks I started noticing her emotionally violent behaviour (screaming and saying hurtful things) on very small issues (some were just a basic difference of opinions). It grew more but was not very frequent. Since we were close, we went to Paris for a trip on my birthday and her behaviour worsened. Honestly, the worst trip of my life. The trip was for 4 days, but on the second day I had it enough. The screaming, fighting and humiliation from her side was so much, that I booked a ticket back to Germany just to get away from her. I was on my way to the airport and she texted &amp; apologized, so we reconciled. I thought rationally, that I came to Paris, might as well see it and complete the trip. After returning, I took distance from her and didn't see her very often, simply because I could not put up with this behaviour anymore and did not want to get hurt again (I am sensitive, and my ex girlfriend was a physical abuser as well - so this brought a lot of hurtful flashback). Ultimately, the meeting stopped and I was up with my life without her. After a few months, she asked to meet again and we did. I thought she had changed, so we grew closer more than ever, so much that recently, we started hanging out every weekend. But the more we hung out, the more we fought. Everytime on the smallest of squabble, she screamed at the top of her lungs like a maniac (so much that the next building could hear her - no exaggeration). She would say the most hurtful things (focusing on self-centric stuff, that how everything is my fault) and then after a while she would apologize. I was always a good friend to her, was there for her whenever she needed me, handled her tantrums, listen to her guy troubles etc. But whenever I needed her emotional support or shared something with her, she would always find a way to tell me that it is my fault (in the most rudest way possible). Some things were nice about her too, she took care of me when I was sick, helped me when needed, but I could not share anything with her, because she'd never listen. If we are having a conversation, it constituted 85% of her speaking and me listening. Yesterday, she was staying over at my place and we had a small argument (which she started out of nowhere) in the supermarket. She started to raise her voice in the supermarket and I told her - let's talk when we reach home. She insisted on talking ""now"" but somehow I managed to get out of the supermarket. She started to yell on the street (lightly), but I stopped her again (because in seconds - it would convert into screaming in public), and politely insisted, let's talk at home and she asked my ""WHY?"". I told her, I don't wanna create a scene in public, its just 5 more minutes and let's reach home. In order to avoid any conversation, I increased my pace and started walking fast so that we get out of the street because I sensed a turmoil of screaming coming up. The moment we reached home, she started packing her stuff to leave. When she got, ready the screaming started. I won't go into a lot of detail of what she said and did, but she threw stuff some clothes at me, screamed at the top of her lungs, punched me on my chest multiple times, threw her phone at the back of my head. When I asked her to ""calm down"", she screamed ""I am calm"". I said, ""You are not calm, look in the mirror"" pointing towards a small shaving mirror on the top of my drawer. She took the mirror and smashed it with her bare hands and threw it on the ground. I said, ""Seriously, now you're gonna break my stuff?"", and she lashed out, ""You want money for that? I can give you money"" and started throwing money at me. In the process, she hurt herself while smashing the mirror and her hands started to bleed (not a lot - but some bleeding bruises on the hands). I saw it and panicked. Somehow I made her sit down (acting ridiculously calm, nomatter what she said or screamed) and did her bandages and made her lie down on the bed. That moment she was just crying but she stopped screaming. I told her, I am going to get more bandages from the Pharmacy and went downstairs. When I got back, she was gone, with a 10 EUR note just below my broken mirror. I got really scared after this situation, because I did not know what to do anymore. She made me feel like shit, said the most hurtful (untrue) things ever and did not even listen to 1 word that I said. Whenever I started a sentence, she interrupted within microseconds by screaming. I made it a point today, that I will never speak to her again in my life, but somehow I still miss her. I blocked her from all my social media (except whatsapp, because my phone broke today and I can't use whatsapp without a phone). The thing that hurts me the most that she never sees her actions and thinks I am the bad guy after all the psychological and physical abuse she throws at me. Worst part - I never got to say my side and how it feels to me. Don't know what to do with this urge to tell her how I feel with her shit (but I know, she would not listen and just scream the moment I speak 1 word). Honestly, I miss her too - don't know how to handle it!",My friend (girl) threw a phone on my head and hurt herself for a small squabble,rudematrix89,2020-05-09 21:30:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggo4wv/my_friend_girl_threw_a_phone_on_my_head_and_hurt/,1,1.0,1,16,1038
domesticviolence,"This is a new account as my boyfriend knows the username of my regular one. I (33f) am posting here because I just want to share my story. I have really no one to talk to. My parents and none of my family know that I have been in an abusive relationship for 2.5 years now. Living together for the last year. 

Anyways, since we moved in together he (25m) became increasingly more violent. Since the beginning of the relationship, though, he‚Äôd always threaten violence when he‚Äôd get mad, and often would break my stuff (phone, our shared bong, tv, table). The physical stuff started with spitting on me, then grabbing my face or neck when he‚Äôd get mad, pushing me/throwing me down and threatening worse. 

Things came to a head on Easter Sunday. We woke up early and he had been keeping me up all night to go wake up and hit a bowl, WHO WAKES UP JUST TO SMOKE WEED BY THE WAY?? Anyways it was annoying and I wasn‚Äôt in the greatest mood by the morning. I tried doing my work from home but he was getting annoyed with me for me showing frustration in him. I had to keep switching rooms to avoid him. Whenever we argue, he is always the primary aggressor. I have a couple times defended myself but he is much meaner and stronger than me. It‚Äôs like whenever we argue he has to take it to a physical level. Anyways it started getting worse- he was pushing me, following me and eventually spat on me. I sat up from the bed and pushed him as hard as I could. He then retaliated by slapping me for the first time across the face. The pain was searing. I dropped to the floor. I lay on the floor gasping for air, my body seizing up in shock and pain. Police were called and I made a statement and he was arrested. He was released same day for a court day in the summer. He returned home. I tried to work things out with him, still processing what he did to me. 

Fast forward a couple weeks. We decide to go up to a cottage Airbb on the lake to get some nice nature time together. I pay for it and drive us there (he is not working now and I am, and has no license). HUGE MISTAKE. The very first night, he slams approx 10 beers and is doing his usual coke. (His almost daily routine, minus the beers. Usually he has coke every day). He is getting more aggressive by the minute. I‚Äôm moving around the cottage, (sigh, the property was beautiful, so much potential for a lovely experience) trying to get away from him. He‚Äôs following me around. I go for a walk. I hear him also walking along a path shortly out of sight from me- I can hear him literally yelling to himself in the middle of cottage country. Like bro grow the f up. Anyways we both return and he is livid. Tried to force me to go to sleep. I couldn‚Äôt, so I got up quietly bc I was restless. This agitated him and he started screaming at me. I yelled back and told him to go to another one of the rooms then. This enraged him and he came in and grabbed me and threw me down to the floor. I told him if he touched me again, I would call the police. The threat enraged him more (by the way I‚Äôve never been the one to call police on him, never have called). So he came back into the room, trying to rip my phone out of my hands. I was screaming and trying so hard to keep hold of it (it‚Äôs so expensive and I can‚Äôt afford to keep replacing my property). We struggled a lot and eventually I relented out of sheer pain and he took the phone. I waited some moments and went to him begging for my property back. He continually told me to get away from him, and held his fist up to my face in the manner he does and threatened to smash my skull in. I got scared bc he was so intoxicated that I went and grabbed a kitchen knife (at this point I had been attacked twice in the bedroom). I held it in my hands about 15 feet from him and said give my back my phone please. He then picked up a dining room chair and started squishing me against the counter. He told me to drop the knife. I dropped the knife. He then proceeded to smash the chair down so hard on my toe that it literally rolled my toenail out from the bottom/from the skin. It was bleeding heavily but I didn‚Äôt realize it yet bc I was wearing socks. I was screaming in excruciating pain; my shrill sounds must have been further enraging to him because as I lay on the floor clutching what is left of my toe, he is grabbing at me, pushing me down more, and telling me to shut up. 

I went to the room again and took of my sock- that‚Äôs when I saw what he did to me. The toe nail is ripped out of the skin and will turn black and come off over the next weeks/months. He was somewhat apologetic but within that, kept screaming at me, grabbing a beer to go outside and drink, while occasionally coming in to be nice and help me stop the bleeding while also switching back to being mean. He then went and took his fist and smashed it down on the kitchen counter, cracking the counter top. I was furious. The Airbb is under my name; my credit card, my e everything. It won‚Äôt be his financial responsibility to pay the damages even though should. I couldn‚Äôt believe that after everything he did to me, he seriously damaged property in the guy‚Äôs beautiful lake house. Sigh. The place was so nice, too. Right on the lake. So much potential, but I should have known better (and I did figure it was a waste of money and time but didn‚Äôt realize just how bad). I can‚Äôt believe this idiot will damage other people‚Äôs homes. He even talked recently about going to a new place, one with a pool so ‚Äúwe could swim together‚Äù since the last place we rented was on a lake and it was too cold. As if I would ever pay to take him somewhere again. He lay next to me in bed as I writhed in pain all night and had to get up every now and then to dress the wound. 

The next morning he was nice again. I had huge bruises all over my arms from him grabbing me so much and pushing me. He asked how I got them and wondered if it was from me ‚Äúfalling on the floor.‚Äù Like no, there are bruises in the shapes of your palm and fingertips all over the arm you were assaulting- they were from you buddy. I told him this. 

But the rest of the trip was marred by his frequent polarity. All I wanted was a nice time with this person. Because of his addictions, he just saw it as an opportunity to get as fucked up as possible. I just wanted a peaceful lake experience. Even though he didn‚Äôt drink the remaining couple of nights, he still wasn‚Äôt kind much. At the end of the trip, after driving us home, he never even said thank you.

So all in all, I paid 700$ for the Airbb, 50$ in gas, $100 in some food and drink (I don‚Äôt drink), plus weed. So approx a thousand dollars. And now, I have a ripped up toe nail that is still oozing, bruises all over my arms, and really sore neck and legs. He‚Äôs just sitting here playing his video games like nothing ever happened. And I‚Äôm sitting here tending to my wound, wondering how many more months I will be dealing with caring for and being careful with my foot until it heals. It‚Äôs throbbing and I‚Äôm sure will not be pleasant as it falls off and grows back over the next couple of months. When I had him in the car I said ‚ÄúI want you to take in how one brief choice you make in a single moment can result in serious and longstanding physical impacts,‚Äù to which he concurred (insincerely, I‚Äôm sure).

domesticviolence,"My boyfriend (M30) has a hot temper and is often abusive to me (F26).  He has a real chip on his shoulder about the fact that I'm white, from a middle class family and well educated while he is an immigrant who left poverty and didn't finish high school.  He always thinks that I think he is inferior because of this and will manipulate everything I say to fit the narrative in his head when actually I couldn't care less.  He also likes to put me down and belittle my achievements to make himself feel better (he has said that himself), such as telling me constantly how stupid I am, that I don't know and can't do anything and the only reason I am studying a Masters is because I bought my way through the system.  

The current COVID situation has made his behavior much worse.  He's lost his job and has no support and so we are completely reliant on my income.  He feels like a failure so he puts me down.  On top of this it's Ramadan so he's hungry and has no nicotine in the day.  Today it reached a boiling point when he slept through his alarm for his early morning meal and I didn't wake him up.  He was pacing and stomping around the house so I locked myself in my study and distracted myself.  When I wouldn't answer the door he smashed it in.  

This makes things really difficult for me with online work and study.  He already makes it really hard for me to work and study from home by constantly demanding my attention and on purposely making lots of loud noises while I'm in meetings  Being able to lock the study has been the only way I've been able to get anything done, now I don't even have a door.

We've been together for over 2 years. We live together alone in a city far away from any friends or family. I've been financially supporting him since we moved here.

I tried to kill myself the other day but he called the cops on me. I have ptsd involving police and he knows that.

I just wanted to vent and maybe get some emotional support as I'm too embarrassed to tell my friends and family.

domesticviolence,"I posted about this two weeks ago. My sister was chocked by her husband until the point of almost passing out, then when she tried to quiet the dog down he kicked her in the face and she almost felt like she broke her nose. He mocked her about calling the police and then grabbed a knife and threatened to kill himself if she left. This was the first time I found out about abuse (only about a 2 year relationship) and I don't believe anything similar has happened before but from her friend I know that there have been other minor issues. 

There is no way I will ever feel comfortable with her being with him. My family and I have tried to be supportive and let her deal with it but there doesn't seem to be any indication that she'll leave him.  She just keeps saying she'll deal with it.

I know she'll hate me and get over it eventually but at what point do I call the police myself? I have pictures of her after the abuse.

domesticviolence,"Hi all, 

When I was in HS I went to my school to have Child Protection Services(DYFUS?) called on my parents, I've been choked, hit, have received 2 concussions, bruises, ect. Emotional abuse and manipulation ontop of it all are a given. 

I have family members that refuse to acknowledge the severity of this, they just don't want to get involved or help in anyway, for ""cultural reasons""

The verdict was ""we can't control how a parent disciplines their child"" Granted I have siblings(all brothers) that lie on behalf of my parents(specifically for my dad) and were in no way willing to cooperate with the social worker, this makes sense and I understand why, however, it didn't stop and as an adult, it is continuing. I cannot remember the last instance from my father, but I receive threats on the  daily and my mom's last outlash was fairly recent. I don't know what I can do about this being that I am an adult and I *can* just leave, only I'm out of 1/2 of my  jobs and haven't had my normal income, even if i did, it wouldn't be doing much, rent is expensive and I'm still in school and really trying to finish(I also pay for school, books, and have some medical bills and other living expenses). I have about 16 credits left but I think I'm reaching my breaking point. I don't know if taking a break from school and finding a full-time job will help me or hurt me, especially because I have so many loans and may go into repayment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also feeling a little conflicted about how  I want to cut off all ties with **all** family members honestly. By standing is just as bad as doing it themselves. I think its scary to have no real familial connections. Getting out of these situations is so hard I feel so stuck like I'm in a donut hole.

domesticviolence,"First of all, I would like to thank all of u for taking the time to help me.

I don't know what to do, I'm 21 and I live at home with my mother who frequently gets beaten by my stepfather. I feel like a horrible person for 'allowing' this.

I got into so many verbal and physical arguments already but it won't stop. I have been trying to seek help for so long, but the cops won't do anything, even though I have plenty of photo and video evidence, because they claim that he doesn't have anything on his criminal record. 

The thing is, me and my mother are financially dependent of him, we don't have any family we can rely on so moving out isn't really a plan.
I have tried seeking help already from financial organisations (I'm from Belgium, so in my case it's OCMW) but they won't help me.

I just want to know how I can get out of this situation, my mom doesn't want to live anymore, and I feel like a failure that I can't do anything.

I really want to move out with my mother and I want to live in a small appartment with her, but she refuses to move out because she wants to keep forgiving him and give him more chances.

I recently graduated high school so my plan is to financially support me and my mother after my graduation of university so we can move out of this hellish household, even though she doesn't want to, I would have the time to convince her, the problem with that is, that it will last at least another 4 years before I graduate university, and my mother definitely won't survive 4 more years of this hell. She's telling me frequently how that she doesn't want to live anymore and only doesn't give up because of me.
My father is also trying to sabotage my school,because he knows that when I finish it, that it's game over for him and that we wont need him anymore.


If there are some people from Belgium, or some people who know a lot about this, is there any other financial aid that I can contact? Also what steps should I take to at least lessen the burden that my mother is carrying.

Thanks

Maybe some noteworthy extra information:
-We have a loan for the appartment we are living in now so we can't just move out immediately 
- my mother can't work fulltime because she has a neural disease, so her nervous system is shutting down slowly, she also has a hernia.
- I have tried combining studying and work, I could maintain this in high school but I won't be able to in university.

domesticviolence,"  

Most of the time we are fine, but my wife has problems when she gets very upset, like throwing/breaking things, screaming, etc. We have been in therapy for a while, she is legitimately trying and has gotten somewhat better. However, about once a year, we will get in an especially bad argument... and unfortunately today was that day.

Our arguments always start off very small and just snowball into this terrible situation so quickly. After a lot of back and forth bickering, I was changing our two-year-old, and she was trying to get near him. I had my back to her and I stepped to the side to block her because I didn't want her to help because I was pissed.

Here is where the real issue started, she walked forward at the same time and said she felt like I like I bumped into her stomach on purpose and hurt her. She is eight months pregnant (I would NEVER harm her or my children on purpose) and she just snapped. There was a whole afternoon of a lot of terrible harsh words, punched me in the shoulder, kicked me, threw things at me, and slapped me in the face. 

I'm large and strong, so it's not like I'm injured, but it still fucking sucks. I also really doubt that she would ever try to seriously harm me, but I had a lot of physical violence directed at me when I was younger so this is something that really upsets me. I admit I said some bad stuff and raised my voice, but hitting your spouse is unacceptable and I can't take it anymore.

I don't trust her and I fucking hate her right now. I don't know what to do, 99% of the time she is a good wife and mother. We have a two-year old and she is eight months pregnant as well, and there's a virus pandemic right now, so I can't just leave. It's not like she's regularly hitting me, but it's still a bad situation and I have no one to talk to in real life. Should I try to forgive given that she is emotional and pregnant right now? She is very remorseful and wants to apologize but I just can't accept right now. I could really use some advice.

domesticviolence,"Hi!

I‚Äôve been with my spouse for 10 years. He‚Äôs always been very immature and as soon as there‚Äôre any problems he shut down and ran away. I‚Äôm the opposite and go after and want to resolve issues.   


One thing I noticed early on was that he didn‚Äôt seem to care about me when we had a conflict, but after I‚Äôve run after him and apologised for my behaviour he started to care.  


We got kids and the years continued. Our fights could be very bad, but rarely physical. More him running away, me running after.   


Him often blaming me for absolutely everything in our life. It‚Äôs my fault he doesn‚Äôt have a career, my fault he doesn‚Äôt have friends, my fault he doesn‚Äôt feel good, my fault we have debt. And so on.  


He‚Äôs also a slob at home. It‚Äôs messy, and then he goes and cleans the hob and expects extreme appreciation when I‚Äôm left to do the whole house myself.  


Of course he is telling himself he‚Äôs doing all the work constantly and I‚Äôm only ‚Äúplaying with my belly button‚Äù and ‚Äúsitting in the sofa‚Äù. This is also what he‚Äôs telling his family, and yes, I think he believes it.   


He‚Äôs never organised any birthdays or events. I do Christmas, Easter, and so on. I buy all the gifts for everyone and I never get any appreciation.  


As you can hear there are, some issues in our relationship.  


There‚Äôre many times he absolutely adores me and wants me to be happy, but he‚Äôs so complicated overall to live with. He‚Äôs so emotionally immature the negative weighs over and I feel like I‚Äôve done the biggest mistake of my life to have kids with this immature guy.  


I‚Äôm posting in domestic violence, because he has on occasion been very violent towards me if I have so much as touched him. He is very defensive. So, if I‚Äôm angry and go after him and holds his arms to stop him, he pushes back with 10X the force and blames me for ‚Äúforcing‚Äù him to do this. He often calls me mean things and have run away and left me twice during both my pregnancies and blamed me for ‚Äúforcing‚Äù him to leave.  


A week ago we were sitting in the sofas and discussing careers and he ridiculed my idea, so I became angry and did the same voice back to him, and he stands up and says he doesn‚Äôt want to talk with me more. He runs up to the office and leaves me downstairs with the kids. I‚Äôm so fed up with this, so I go after and says he must be able to discuss things. I accidentally open the door on him and he hunts me down the hallway push me into the wall and take a strangulation grip around my neck and lifts his fist up to threaten me. I fall down and shake.  
My daughter comes up. He just goes back to the office and leaves me crying on the floor. After a few minutes I feel angry and goes back and says he can leave the house immediately. That he‚Äôs not welcome home again. He goes closer and says ‚Äúnever‚Äù lifts his fist and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to punch you in the head if you don‚Äôt leave me alone‚Äù and I of reaction bitch slap him, in which he totally loses,it and hunts me through the hallway again. I try to shield myself, and he takes the position and gives me such a kick in my arms and ribs into the wall that I experience whiplash feelings for a few days. I can barely move. My daughter and son witnessed everything. When I tell him he should go to jail he says, in front of the kids, that he would do it all over again and have no regrets.   


Since then, I‚Äôve lost all feelings of love, respect and feelings for him. I stopped talking with him, which I never done for 10 years. I claimed the bedroom and he‚Äôs sleeping me the couch.   


He‚Äôs not showing any remorse or regrets. He even seem angry on me. He‚Äôs very destructive. Sits with YouTube videos to learn how to become a mechanic for hours every day and neglect the house and the kids. All of a sudden he gives the kids junk food, ice cream, candy and drinks beer.   


I feel like I‚Äôm seeing the guy that he really is. We have been eating very healthy, Keto, and stuff for many years and he‚Äôs been playing to be this ambitious guy. But in reality, he takes no initiative to anything. He‚Äôs so immature. 

Should I add that he a few weeks ago was angry with me because he felt he did everything in the house, after I had made breakfast for him and coffee, and he said that I could at least make coffee that isn't too hot to drink and poured it all over me so I burnt myself because I went after him in the stairs to try and talk with him. Then he took a large filled bin back and opened it and threw it over the whole floor. I took the kids and went out for 9 hours. He didn't show any remorse until I started talking with him afterwards. 

I don‚Äôt know what I should do next. I feel a big urge to talk with others. I'm not asking for help whether I should be with him or not. It‚Äôs just that I need to talk with someone. I‚Äôm too ashamed that I‚Äôve met a man that hits me and hurts me and says these stuff to me.",Need to just talk with others that might have experienced something similar,Redantagen,2020-05-07 21:28:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gffn3u/need_to_just_talk_with_others_that_might_have/,4,1.0,3,12,967

domesticviolence,"I have been with my[25F] husband[28M] for 4 years. For the first 2 years of dating, I could easily say that he could be impatient. I have bouts of anxiety and he can be supportive, but he can also be impatient if he starts to feel helpless. He‚Äôs very logical but I always felt like he listened to me and we were very in sync. We have the same, goofy sense of humor and are very gentle with each other. We have never rough housed with each other at all. If we are ever mean/sarcastic due to bad moods, we are very quick to apologize to each other. 

He‚Äôs a very passionate man, and that is what I love about him. He can be hyper at times, kinda like a little kid. But I love his enthusiasm. This is not to say he acts like he‚Äôs on crack 24/7. He‚Äôs either pretty mellow, but if he‚Äôs talking about what he loves or is in a good mood, he is passionate. I have always felt very safe having sex with him as well. 

In 2018, I remember one night he slammed the door because I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I was keeping him up and he eventually slept on the couch. I remember thinking to myself, hmmm, I don‚Äôt like that. I don‚Äôt like that he slams doors. He hasn‚Äôt done it since.

In 2019, we were long distance. We dealt with the challenges of being long distance such as learning how to communicate with each other, and we got through it successfully. I do recall that in December, we had a disagreement about our Christmas vacation plans and I wanted to keep talking about it. He didn‚Äôt. I kept trying to nudge him about something, and he eventually flared his nostrils and stomped on the ground like a little kid saying he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it.

It‚Äôs been 4 months since then. This past weekend, we found out we spent about $1000 in groceries in the past 2 months. COVID, amirite? At first, he calmly stated he was in disbelief and that he did not want to pay for any groceries in the future except for ingredients for pb&amp;j and beans. Again, at this point, I‚Äôm sitting at the kitchen counter and we‚Äôre still pretty calm about everything. The conversation has turned serious, but again, he didn‚Äôt raise his voice or disrespect me.

Then, he says, oh god, did I eat lunch? When‚Äôs the last time I ate something? He has a big appetite and ate a bowl of rice like 4 hours ago. He says he suddenly doesn‚Äôt feel well and that he needs to shower and eat. 

I walk to the bathroom sink, and then he tells me, with his eyes wide that he can‚Äôt pick up the laundry and that the laundry was in either machine 14 or 15. He was very, very visibly upset at this point. I mean, he wasn‚Äôt smiling, jaw was probably clenched, and his tone of voice was off. He wasn‚Äôt his normal, relaxed, or even normal, irritated self. My flight or fight kicked in at this point. 

I went to get the laundry and when I came back, I told him the his body language was very upsetting to me. He said that he didn‚Äôt like that I thought that he could have been aggressive because he would never do that. He said that he admits he was sorry he was so upset/being weird and that the hunger/icky feeling/bad mood triggered him. He said that if I were to continue to think that he could hit me, it could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. I had a panic attack after this happened, thinking that my marriage is over, even though the only truly upsetting thing that happened was my reaction. The fact that I could even be in a state where I think he could hurt me. I don‚Äôt think he could, but doesn‚Äôt every abused man/woman say that? 

I truly feel like he was made for me, and that we compliment each other, and that the relationship is nurturing 99% of the time. I just can‚Äôt tell if I should be worried these are signs of future abuse or if I simply have a partner that has a bad, but not incurable, temper. Again, I can only think of three instances in the past 4 years we‚Äôve been together where I‚Äôve felt nervous/uncomfortable due to his temper.

Sigh. I love him. This quarantine has been hard. For a month, I thought we were kicking it and I felt so proud of us for being so supportive of each other, but now I feel totally out of sync with him and I want to get back to a state of neutrality. I feel ashamed to because I have this notion that once you get married, you are mature and these kinds of events should be nonexistent. 


Ever since this happened, things are back to normal... except I can‚Äôt stop obsessively thinking about the moment in the bathroom. I keep thinking... was he lying when he said he wasn‚Äôt even thinking about hitting me? Why were his eyes so wide? Why did I feel so on edge? Yes, he was on edge so naturally I would feel that too. I hate hate haaaate that I even mentioned it to him that I thought he was going to hit me. I keep having intrusive thoughts about us being physical with each other. It‚Äôs truly upsetting. 

TL;DR: my husband got upset because he was in a bad mood and we found out we spent $1000 on groceries. He was in a bad mood due to being hungry, and then the bad news. His aggressive body language tone/scared me, is our relationship doomed?

He gets them while I am at work (M-F 9am-5pm), and they sleep two scheduled nights a week there. I get the rest of the evenings and they are with me all weekend uninterrupted. Our mothers exchange them so that the restraining order can be respected. 
Our 3 year old has been having a lot of difficulty adjusting. He throws large fits about anything and everything whenever he comes back. It takes hours to get my son out of this upset state. And I don‚Äôt know if I should worry that my son isn‚Äôt being cared for properly at his fathers or if he is just having difficulty in between two homes. My son has not said anything bad about his father I see no signs of abuse. But I worry as you can imagine. I don‚Äôt trust their father for the things he did to me and now I am struggling to trust him to care for our children properly. 
For those of you who have left a domestic violence home with children involved, how did your children react? What helped your children cope? Were you ultimately able to trust your ex to care for your children?

domesticviolence,"I was good friends with a girl and her boyfriend for a while and then she opened up to me and told me that he was abusing her.

As time went on their relationship got worse. He was extremely violent, one time I was at home and recovering from a surgery but my best friend was texting me that she wasn't safe. He had pulled her out of her car by her hair and threw her in the street and drove off. That night I told her sister and they got her because I couldn't do anything.

My best friend explained to me the many things he would do to her, I remember once she said he would choke her, and hit her on the back.

Eventually it became too much to be around. He took this opportunity after having cheated on her, to propose to my best friend and she said yes. That was around when I couldn't do it anymore.

I had been in an abusive relationship myself, and although it wasn't as violent as her relationship it still hit too close to home. Me and her sister would always try to get her to leave him, of course it never happened.

She's still getting married to him and they've set the date. Honestly I feel so guilty sometimes, thinking I could have saved her. It also upsets me how she knew how bad her relationship was and how much support she had but still chose to be with him and not accept my help... I don't understand why she stays in this world. I think she would even get mad or defensive sometimes when I used to try to mention leaving him.

I even messaged her during quarantine to say I was hoping she was ok at this time (especially because of the rising DV rates due to quarantine). I got no answer.

I don't know. What would you do? How would you feel?

domesticviolence,"Hi! My name is Arina,I'm 12 years old and I'm from Russia(gonna use real information for comfortable writing). My dad drinks for almost my and mom's life.

Let's start when she wasn't pregnant. He left for 1 week to other town and was drinking there. Then he did it again when she was pregnant. When I was 1.5 years old he left again. After some time he encoded for 5 years and around 8 years old he started drinking again,and here's the start of my story...

When I was 9 years old my mom drove to business trip and left me with him. At first weeks time spending was great until one day. I just came back from school and saw him sitting at kitchen. He was talking with mother on phone and said:""Heh,a pie came(he always called me a pie)"". He gave me his phone,mom said:""Arina,don't worry,dad just drank a little"". I was talking with mother for some minutes,then he started snatching the phone from me by force. He threatened,he grabbed it(phone),and just smashed the phone screen on the table. I started screaming and crying. After some time when mom came back from business trip and asked him when he was drunk again:""Why you grabbed phone from her?"",and guess what he said? ""That's MY phone,I'm able to grab it"".

Another story when I was 10 years old. It was a fight of my mom and dad. It wasn't that big but I just want to say it. He was drunk again. She took sth like a mop(?) to defend. She pushed him into his room,he took a big bowl(?) and wanted to attack her but she closed the door at the right time and sound was loud. Then she started crying and I was hugging her.

Next story was in autumn of 2019. My mother drove to business trip again. First week was great again but time came.(He was encoded for that time until next situation) He was sleeping,I came to his room and I felt smell of ""beer"". I was like ""what is this smell?"".  I thought that he was just tired and let him sleep. But after time I learned that he uncoded some days ago. And after some time he just left home for 2 days. But my aunt took me to her home and I spend time with my cousin.

Next story was in February of 2020. It's a story when he was about to die. He was drinking beer,vodka for 3 weeks. He was sleeping and my mom entered his room and saw that drool dripped from his mouth. We called ambulance,they took him and other things.

And last story is uninteresting because he just wasn't at home for 1 day and took homemade alcohol.

I wanted to die. I wanted to forget about him but I was scary to die. I didn't tried but thought about suicide. But I'm scary to leave mom in such situation/position. I'm not talking to him for almost 2 months. Also,my mother talked with him,just gonna write their conversation.
(M-Mom,D-Dad)
M:""Why you don't want to hug her? Why you don't to talk to her?""
D:""But she doesn't talk to me! I'm waiting for her to come.""

Does he even knows why I'm not talking to him? I loose trust to him,he always said that ""I love you and mom! I'm sorry!"" but I don't see this love.

What I need to do? I really want them to divorce but mom need to pay credit for 2-3 years in the amount of 20 thousand rubles(275 dollars) each month. Give me some advice,please.

domesticviolence,"I don't even know where to begin. I am (F28) engaged to a (M44.) We've been together for approximately 5 years. Engaged for about 1.5 of those years. Bear with me as this will be a bit long. 

I guess ill start by saying in all honesty I was not a good person at the beginning of our relationship. I was coming out of a battle with heroin addiction. I knew him as an individual who had a few years sober from some self help meetings i attended. He ended up saving my life in an overdose suicide attempt and we grew pretty close. I was a shitty person back then; a liar, a cheater, a thief - you name it. He asked to date eventually and I said yes but I saw other guys anyway and hurt him pretty badly and we went seperate ways. I missed this guy more than i ever thought i would and down the road we decided to try for real. I had really changed and blossomed as a decent human being out of the darkness in my life. I know it was twisted from the beginning but just stay with me please.

So we are together and things are great for about a year and all the sudden he starts pulling back from me and i feel like its my fault for how i was when we first met and maybe i was being punished. I convinced myself i deserved it and it wouldn't last forever. Just little things. He stopped wanting to communicate.  He didnt stand up for me when one guy came out of nowhere from my past drug addiction, he stopped calling my by his pet name for me, and less cuddles. Then two and a half years in and it was getting worse. He would tell me to be at a place at whatever time, for example his brothers xmas party we were going to go to and i was going to be a few minutes late to meet him so he made a point of being in his truck when i got there and speeding off like a bat out of hell because i wasted a few minutes of his time. So i took it personally and was pretty hurt. He blocked me on social medias and calls if i tried to come to him to talk about a problem and i would see him somewhere so i walked up to his truck and went to open the door to ask what was wrong and he locked the door and sped off while my hand was on the handle. I could have been really hurt. I ended up leaving but i was stuck in the cycle by now. He came back a few months later and said things would change so i told him id give him a chance.

I was so very wrong. Big big mistake. We were good for another few months. Asked me to marry him. Of course i thought things were really changing and i said yes. We bought a house and i moved in. I had my own house prior and my sister was going to be homeless from a abusive marriage and 4 kids so i let her move in and take it over. Its been 8, almost 9 months. As soon as my sister got my old house and i brought the last of my things over shit went straight back to where it was. Its like a switch flipped. Its different though. It like he thinks im a personal maid. His sexual advances arent friendly. He grabs at my breasts so hard he pinches my nipples and smacks my ass way too hard so it hurts. After sex he throws the towel at me after he cleans himself off or if ive left the room, throws it to my side of the bed or floor. His latest is/was every night (even though hes been laid off for months and im an essential worker) he demands dinner through messages before i even get off of work or asks me what im making. He wont feed the dogs and asks me when i get home why i havent fed them yet or talks to them about how sad it is i let them starve. He has started trying to control my daughter to the point now my daughter stayed with my mom while i was at work a few weeks ago and she told my mom he was hurting her feelings. Shes only just going to be 8 this year. I feel like im failing and i feel stuck like i dont know where to go. I have worked so so hard to have a better life and give my daughter the world from where i was.

domesticviolence,"tldr- I think I‚Äôm in another abusive relationship and in denial / trying to force myself to leave even though I‚Äôm not fully mentally ready 


I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (26m) for almost 2 years. Well call him J. We‚Äôve lived together for almost a year and a half. He has a huge issue with lying. I won‚Äôt go too deep into it, but he‚Äôs told enormous lies, so big that I‚Äôm too embarrassed to say them now because I look so dumb for not leaving him then. And it‚Äôs constant. To me, his family, his coworkers/employers.. to get out of trouble usually. But with me, he also lies just to hurt me. He makes up completely false scenarios &amp; relationships just to hurt me.. I‚Äôve also found myself completely isolated from all my friends because they ‚Äúweren‚Äôt good infuences‚Äù bc they partied &amp; did things he didn‚Äôt agree w.. and all my family hates him. He embarrassed me by making a seen and walking out on a family wedding.. I don‚Äôt have any social media at all now bc if him.. and there‚Äôs so much more
Anyways, he has grabbed my thoat, and other small things when fighting.. on Sunday he saw something he didn‚Äôt like on my phone and woke me up at 630am by assaulting me.. he ended up pinning me down and choking me saying ‚Äúdo you want to die bitch‚Äù .. he had me by the back of my head too and slammed my head face first into the floor.. it was hard enough that I saw stars for the first time in my life. My left eye has little red dots under it, and I have a bruise under my right eye brow. My head hurt all day. He did this when he was sober. He left right after that (packed his things- we live together. Also stuck on a least until the end of September. I tried to leave him in January but the landlord refused to take me off the lease. I was afraid to get a second lease in my name and get sued if he abandoned the house. He told me he‚Äôs abandoned an apartment before and it ruined his credit. I‚Äôve been trying to build my credit and save money for months, so I would be devastated if I got sued or leaving hurt my credit). While he was gone, he texted me and said he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me like that and wouldn‚Äôt do it again. He came back a few hours later. But when he came back, he was so much worse. He immediately grabbed me by my hair, pushed me around, etc. he dumped water on me and opened my pants and spit in my pants. It was so violating. He picked me up by my throat and hit the back of my head against a wall .. he did that two more times. He destroyed my succulents I‚Äôve been growing for a year (my favorite plants. I adored them. He made me get rid of my old cat that I literally saved off the streets and bonded with.. the best cat ever. All because I saved the cat while living w my ex before him.. I beat myself up every day about this, the only thing that gives me peace is the cat is thriving now with a family member) and honestly, the part that broke me the most was the succulent. I loved it so much. It started to grow little baby vines off the top of it and it was so cute. My heart really shattered (I salvaged what I could the best I could. But it‚Äôs no where close to the same. ) he also smashed an expensive crystal I bought recently over and over against the wall. All while intermittently pushing me around, grabbing me, yelling at me. I‚Äôm covered in bruises on my arms, back, and legs. The windows were open the whole time (we have close neighbors) and I was crying and yelling the whole time, secretly hoping someone would hear and call the cops. It was honestly traumatic and there‚Äôs actually a lot I‚Äôm leaving out. 

Background, this is my third consecutive relationship that has resulted in DV. I‚Äôm devastated. When I was 18 I was assaulted my by the boyfriend (call him G) in every way. The worst caused me to go to the hospital. It was one of the worst experiences of my life and I had to go to the cops / court about it. When the cops questioned me about what happened, I completely felt stupid. I didn‚Äôt go to them immediately, I waited until I talked to my mom first the next day. They kept asking why I didn‚Äôt call them immediately, and they emphasized asking me what I did to cause him to do that to me. It was humiliating and I felt like they didn‚Äôt believe me, despite my face being completely fucked up from the assault. I was only 18. I didn‚Äôt know what DV was. 

I also ended an engagement when I was 20, to my second relationship in this story (call him A) . How he fits into this story.. I worked with him at the time. As soon as my 1st bf assaulted me, instead of going to the police, I was so in shock I drove to bf #2‚Äôs house (he was only my coworker at the time) bc he lived down the street. A was the only person who saw me immediately after G assaulted me, I was absolutely covered in blood and swollen. I ended up in a long term relationship with A right after I left G. We moved states away from my family to be close to his family when I was only 19. I ended up leaving at 20 bc became extremely angry and violent all the time over the smallest things. He grabbed my throat while fighting once or twice, but yelled and screamed at me constantly and broke my belongings. The final straw was him grabbing my face and pushing my head against the wall. We had two beautiful dogs together. I had to leave them both to move back home, completely broke and newly unemployed. Side note, all of these men are 6‚Äô2-6‚Äô4, 190-200lbs, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 110lbs)

My last two long term relationships ended with restraining orders. 

J knows about my past relationship history. He knows I was abused before. He then went ahead and did the same thing, but worse in a different way. I can‚Äôt begin to explain everything. But this last Sunday I swear he wanted to kill me. I ended up going to urgent care for a concussion. The xrayed my neck (I have bruises on it) and did a CT scan of my head. Good news is everything turned up okay and it was just a mild concussion. My head hurt all night, and the next day (yesterday) my neck hurt. My neck still hurts today but not as bad. I did not file a police report. The urgent care lady tried to force me into it, but I did refuse. Honestly because 1) I feel like I pushed him to that point 2) he has not had a history of domestic violence 3) I don‚Äôt think he would ACTUALLY kill me I think he wanted to scare me, but it worked. It was terrifying and I go from feeling sad to numb/empty. 4) my previous experience reported incidents to the police was also traumatizing. (There was one incident G broke his restraining order by coming to my work place and texting me. The judge absolutely humiliated me in front of the entire court room and G , and made me seem crazy .. i left the stand rushed out of court room crying because it was so humiliating) so I told myself I would never involve myself in court or police reports again. 
My last two long term relationships ended with restraining orders. I cannot have a third end the same way. 
Also, I work for the police. I‚Äôm a police dispatcher. I hear how officers talk about women like me. Women in DV situations. They talk about them like they‚Äôre the problem, like they‚Äôre a burden and annoying, no respect for them at all, etc. it‚Äôs heartbreaking and humiliating to say the least. So I feel like I absolutely cannot go to the police. Unless he seriously injured me, like broke a bone, black eye, etc. then I would. 

I‚Äôm at a complete loss. I‚Äôve known this has been a toxic relationship since before it began but I stayed anyway. I feel myself deteriorating. I look like I‚Äôve aged. I feel so ugly and hideous and unwanted and unseen and unloved and unappreciated. I feel so hopeless. I‚Äôve lost all my friends except for 2 that I don‚Äôt see or talk to as much as I‚Äôd like. Everyone sees me as an idiot and desperate for being in this relationship. 

There‚Äôs so so so much more to all of these stories but I know this is a novel and I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve broken any rules or annoyed anyone with the length of this. My heart is just so so broken. 

The issue is I‚Äôm stuck on a lease with J until the end of September... the landlord refuses to take me off the lease, and I‚Äôm scared to be on two leases at once. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get sued if he damages or abandons the house, which is likely. But I‚Äôm so close to saying fuck it. I have a deposit down on an apartment downtown st Louis. I‚Äôve never lived downtown a city before or in an apartment before. (Part of me has always wanted to live in a city since I was a kid, the other part of me has always lived in a house and I‚Äôm scared of the difference that a high rise apt will be. ) 

I‚Äôm just at such a loss. He won‚Äôt leave the house if I don‚Äôt leave, and he‚Äôll probably abandon it if I do. I don‚Äôt want to tell the landlord the details of the DV because I don‚Äôt want J to get kicked out before he‚Äôs ready to move. I know he‚Äôll be heartbroken once I actually leave and I feel so guilty and terrible because part of me doesn‚Äôt want to leave even though I know I have to. I also didn‚Äôt file a police report, so I know have legal proof. All I have are photos and the urgent care paperwork. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. And I don‚Äôt even feel excited about moving out and starting over. The apartment is beautiful, but I‚Äôm so sad to be without him and scared that I won‚Äôt be able to save money anymore. 

Side note, he is amazing in so many other ways. He‚Äôs so talented musically (can sing, play piano, drums, guitar, makes beats, mixes/masters, everything.) he also is extremely attractive. The most attractive man I‚Äôve ever dated. Extremely fit and handsome. Jaw line and everything. He has long (shoulder length) gorgeous red wavy hair. He looks like a modern day ginger Jesus and a Greek God sculpted into one. He‚Äôs great in bed and a thoughtful lover. He goes out of his way every day to surprise me with coffees and energy drinks and other gifts. Always buys our food or cooks healthy. He opens the passenger door for me every time we go anywhere. He got me into working out and cooking. Before him, I never grocery shopped and only ate fast food. Also, I had no savings before him. I lived paycheck to paycheck. Now I have almost $10,000 in savings plus my retirement fund and investments- all things he‚Äôs taught me. He‚Äôs help me grow up in so many ways. We also share similar kinks. 

It‚Äôs just really hard. I‚Äôm so attatched to him. I can‚Äôt picture living without him. I know how stupid I am and how ridiculous it is. Honestly, writing it out made me realize how absurd the whole thing is and how truly dumb I am for not leaving ages ago... I‚Äôve numbed myself to it so much and I‚Äôm clinging on to the idea of him and our good times. The dates and adventures, the vacations. The inside jokes. My heart breaks. I feel like I‚Äôm grieving. 

At this point, I realize I‚Äôve never found myself ever. I‚Äôve never truly been okay with being alone. I‚Äôve never healed from any of the past trauma. I myself am toxic in relationships, and I attract toxic relationships. I feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me in the fact that 1) I made all these men do this to me and 2) I am attracted to something inside all of these men. I feel like the girl who cried wolf. I can‚Äôt show up in court for the third time for the same thing with a different man. I truly feel like I‚Äôm crazy and I‚Äôm insane and causing this to keep happening to me. I‚Äôm trying so hard to listen to my brain and not my emotions. I‚Äôm just so hurt and I‚Äôm honestly so sad and scared to leave him now. 

If I leave, I am so scared to ever let another man in my life. I have no desire for anything from men. I feel like I‚Äôll be so apathetic if anyone approaches me and constantly think about J. I can‚Äôt imagine him with anyone else. I wanted to be his. I‚Äôm so so sad. Im also worried that I‚Äôll fall into another relationship like this since I‚Äôve developed a pattern. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be bitter and crazy and sad and alone and insecure and regretful my whole life. I‚Äôm so sad. I know I need therapy. It‚Äôs on my list, but with moving out on my own, and covid has affected my pay, I won‚Äôt have much money left over after bills.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôve read a bunch of posts here and it seems all of them involve bruises from hitting or otherwise. Has anyone stayed with someone who didn‚Äôt go that far and was ok?

A few months ago my husband and I had an argument and hugged me and wouldn‚Äôt let go after me asking 15 times, and only let go after I started crying. He said he never heard me ask him to let go. He apologized, said it was wrong (eventually).

Two days ago we had an argument about him helping with chores. He hasn‚Äôt been very helpful in the past. He says he doesn‚Äôt care if the house is a mess. He has a very stressful job and works 60-80 hour weeks and doesn‚Äôt have as much time or energy to help. I get frustrated after he tells me outright he won‚Äôt do what he said he‚Äôd do (again), swear to his face, then walk out into the laundry room. As I‚Äôm pulling out clothes, he rushes in, grabs my wrists and pulls me away (it did hurt but didn‚Äôt leave a mark, just redness), pushing me out of the room, saying he is going to do the chore that he told me he wouldn‚Äôt do earlier. Now I‚Äôm not proud of this, but my first reaction was fight, not flight. I tried to push my way back (he‚Äôs a little more than twice my weight), and he pushed me back, and now I‚Äôm scared so I grab a pen and threaten him with it. He then runs to grab his phone and threatens to call the police. I call his mom just to chat and he calms down. 

We talked about it and he says that he doesn‚Äôt remember pushing and grabbing me first, but only remembers me trying to hit back, so he says he was scared and that‚Äôs why he wanted to call the police. He also said that it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as bad as hitting‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs the thing. We‚Äôve been together 6 years. Two events spaced months apart. He has a quick temper but usually he just ignores me when we‚Äôve argued in the past. He‚Äôs been running on 4 hours of sleep a night for a week because of his job. He actually forgets what he eats most days because he‚Äôs so into his job. He‚Äôs one of the hyperfocus types. He otherwise is nice to everyone around him. He is generous to people. He works hard. He loves his family and aside from his family being hard-set Christians they are a bit controlling (no drinking, etc) but they are nice too. He was home-schooled so doesn‚Äôt have the same exposure to social conventions. He didn‚Äôt hit me and says he never would (not sure if I can trust this given what I‚Äôve read about abusers). He is incredibly immature at times (never takes responsibility for anything he does wrong unless I work at it, then he does). He used to be demeaning towards me and that stopped years ago. He also used to blame me if I got emotionally hurt by something he said but that also stopped after a lot of conversations. He used to yell in verbal fights but he learned to isolate and calm himself down. He has made real progress. 

So now I‚Äôm faced with a dilemma. He has been able to improve. After this last event, he says that what he did was wrong *if my series of events are true*, and he‚Äôll just never touch me during a fight again (although why did he think it was ok in the first place? I think he must have thought it was ok?). He thought that hugging me and not letting go months ago was ok because he heard that‚Äôs what you can do with children when they‚Äôre having a tantrum. (He has said ‚Äúact like a child, get treated like one‚Äù in the past, but has since agreed that‚Äôs not ok.) All of this has made me think he really is stuck as a 5 year old who never got called out for hitting someone in the playground because there was no one else growing up except his brother (who he still wrestles with, as an almost 30 year old).

On the other side, I don‚Äôt think I can ever see him in the same way again. I‚Äôm not sure if I can love him again. This is someone who brought physical force to a verbal argument. This might be the beginning of escalation, or it might not. 

Has anyone seen someone have only one mild physical event and not do it again?

tl;dr husband had two mild physical events months apart after 6 years together. He seems somewhat repentant. Can I really be sure this will happen again?",Mild case?,throwaway05042020,2020-05-05 19:40:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ge4itm/mild_case/,6,1.0,3,2,795
domesticviolence,"About a year ago, I finally ended things with my emotional and sexually abusive partner of over 5 years. When we were together, I knew he was being emotionally abusive, and I knew he was doing things sexually that I did not truly consent to, but I let myself be convinced that I was just a prude or had a low sex drive. He even convinced me to spend hundreds of dollars on a sex therapist because of my ‚Äúsex drive problems.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until the clarity after the fact that I realized he‚Äôd really been assaulting me, which has apparently resulted in more trauma than I realized.

I‚Äôve spent the list year putting my life back together and it‚Äôs mostly been really great. I‚Äôve gotten back into the things I was doing less of, because he convinced me that they were too stressful on me. I‚Äôve made lots of new friends through these things. I would like to start dating again, but have only been on one date, several months ago, where I almost had a panic attack when the poor dude tried to kiss me. This was what got me re-thinking everything and made me realize that the idea of someone touching me causes me physical nausea.

And now we‚Äôre all in quarantine. Last weekend, I saw my ex out on his motorcycle with a girl, his new girlfriend I assume. This has given me a lot of confusing feelings:

\-Jealousy and hurt that she gets to enjoy the good version of him. Things were great with the good version of him.

\-Anger at myself for missing that version of him.

\-Jealousy and anger that he gets to spend quarantine happy with someone, whereas I‚Äôm barely keeping my shit together alone in my house with barely any personal contact. That is some infuriatingly unfair bullshit right there.

\-Anger at the fact that this girl, along with everyone else in his life, has definitely been fed a story about how I‚Äôm a complete bitch, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs getting lots of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you have someone better for you‚Äù types of comments. I hate that him and I are the only ones who know what really happened. And it‚Äôs probably really only me, since I‚Äôm sure he sees a whole different truth, in which case, how do I know I haven‚Äôt been totally delusional all along?

\-Concern for this girl‚Äôs mental and physical well-being down the line

\-Probably other things I can‚Äôt quite articulate

I'd come so far, but now I'm a hot mess at the worst possible time.

domesticviolence,"This post is going to be really long, and I apologize for that ahead of time

This is something I don't usually talk about-and especially not with strangers online-but I've really been struggling with the idea of entering the dating scene after my last relationship. My ex-boyfriend was a part of my life for 6 years (4 as a close friend, 2 as my boyfriend), and despite the fact that I was so sure I knew who he was, our relationship turned emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially abusive within 6 months. It was as though he flicked a switch and became an entirely different person, someone I could have never imagined living behind the charm and compassion he'd shown me for the past 4.5 years. 

In the 2 years that our relationship lasted, I was cut off from everyone I once considered a friend. My own family had abandoned me. I moved 16 hours away from everything I'd ever known to have a ""fresh start"" where ""all the bad stuff would be left behind"".  My mental health was an all time low. I was failing out of school. He refused to work, instead claiming to be a ""full time student"" while forcing me to maintain all of his classes in addition to mine. He expected me to support us both, while working 2 jobs, which he eventually forced me to quit. Everything turned into an argument, an accusation: ""Why are you wearing make up?"" ""You don't need to brush your hair"" ""Why are you 5 minutes late?"" ""Why aren't you texting me back while you're at work?"" 

He went so far as to force me to send him pictures of myself working, force me to strip naked so he could inspect my body for ""suspicious marks"", expected me to have an explanation for every scratch or bruise, would break up with me and kick me out whenever he felt like it. My name was a constant trade between ""cunt"" and ""whore"", and there were many times when arguments turned physical. He destroyed thousands of dollars worth of my things, he would force me to look down whenever there was another man in my presence, he would read my journals and search through my phone. The number of stories and lists of things he has done to me are endless. It wasn't until I'd been living out of my car for 2 days after having left him that I found my way to a battered women's shelter. That was the first time I left him, but in total it took me 3 attempts to break up with him. 

However, it's taken me so much longer than that to recover from the damage he has left me with. A list of diagnosis including: CPSTD, Anorexia, MDD, and GAD. Not to mention all of the symptoms of trauma. 

Fast forward 2 year later, and here I am. 25 years old, and still putting together the pieces of my life. I'm able to get out of bed and shower each day without struggle, I don't think about ending it all anymore. I don't throw up whenever my anxiety rears it's ugly head, I can brush my hair without having to face the door. Hell, most days I even eat 2 meals (sometimes 3!!!). I'm actively in therapy, I'm going back to school, I'm making decent money, I've reconnected with my family, and I've even made some new (and awesome) friends along the way. 

But one thing I can't manage to do, no matter how hard I try, is enter the dating scene. Sleeping around? No problem. I've been with a few men since me and my ex have broken up. But anytime I get involved with someone and I want it to be more than just sex, I can't smother the panic that sits in the bottom of my chest. My mind starts racing, I can't relax no matter how hard I try. When I'm hanging out with the person, I can feel myself tense up and I have to fight the urge to bolt out the door. It makes it really hard to maintain a relationship or even enjoy the possibility of a new one when I'm constantly fighting every nerve in my body and focusing on trying to read everything. The idea of talking to someone about myself, being vulnerable with another person, makes me want to throw up. Even investing my time and attention into another person, and looking forward to hearing from them or gaining expectations toward the relationship scares me. My mind is always racing with the what ifs and the endless possibilities, the idea that everything is so ""go with the flow"" and I'm not actively able to define and control it. 

So if you've managed to stay with me this far, I guess my whole point behind posting this is because I wanna know if anyone else has dealt with this? And what have you done to ease all the discomfort? I don't want to be stuck this way, constantly avoiding relationships for the rest of my life out of fear or lack of control... But I also feel at a loss on how to stop all of these symptoms from leaking out. I'm over my ex-boyfriend, and I'm reading to move on and start getting myself out there again. I just don't really know what I'm supposed to do or how to go about navigating a relationship after the amount of bullshit I've been through.",Dating After Domestic Abuse,xximoKayyxx,2020-05-05 02:38:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gdpkzg/dating_after_domestic_abuse/,1,0.86,5,4,919
domesticviolence,"At the present moment I am still living at home with my mum, I still haven't been to the agency that looks after domestic violence housing etc.. 

But what's happening is this:  I have ordered a couple more items to be sent to me. One is a new mobile phone because the mic on my current one is dead (and it's crashing all the time). The reason behind this, is so that if ever I get a job interview call, I can answer it without using my headset I use for gaming, or a hardly functioning wireless mic.

The second, is a new desktop unit, my current computer is an ex display model, who knows how long it's been on the floor for, I've had it for a few years and it feels like it's starting to wear out. So I've got a new desktop which I hope will last me for a few years to come.

Now here's the thing. Because I've had a few things delivered to where I live, my mum don't like this, and she says to me ""If you get anything more delivered to this house, you're out!"" She's doing this to not only control me, but to try and get me pay up some money for rent etc .. well why would I pay a woman like this any $$ for any of her bills etc .. I know it sounds harsh .. but it's the truth. She's a negative, pessimistic narcissist that possibly thrives on trying to control others.

But that's not all .. I feel that, if she intercepts either of these particular deliveries for me, she'll question me as to what it is why I have it .. and then smash the mobile phone.

domesticviolence,"For year‚Äôs the abuse lasted. In 2018 he was arrested, by that time he had pulled a knife out on me, attacked me, hit me and relentlessly blamed me for his actions. Obviously it was never his fault, always mine. 
He was arrested three time‚Äôs, each time I didn‚Äôt press charges. Once he was arrested I didn‚Äôt see him for 7 months, but despite the order preventing him contacting me, he did. 
After 7 months waiting for trial, I believed everything he said and believed him when he said he was sorry and he had changed. 
He came home, I spoke to my family, persuaded them he had changed and was a whole new person. 
Three months later, it started again. 
Started gradually for at least a month, soon we were back in the cycle. 
Him drinking far too much, me taking the brunt of his anger. I‚Äôm ashamed to say, my teenage daughter witnessed it. 
Once because my job made him mad ( I got a promotion and suddenly earnt more than him.. it shouldn‚Äôt of made a difference but.. it did) another his family member pissed him off, so he drank too much and leathered me! After that, I didn‚Äôt message him enough when I was at work!! Soon, he didn‚Äôt need a reason, simply an excuse. 
New Year‚Äôs Eve was the worst. Over and over again he brought my face down on his knee. The month before I‚Äôd had emergency surgery so I was on crutches.. not enough to stop him. But, for the first time, he apologised. I woke up bruised all over, he woke with a sore head and cried. I‚Äôd messaged his mum, she knew what he was like and said I think this really is the turning point! I was hopeful. He did change, for almost 3 weeks. Anyway, fast forward. 
Last week he was arrested. He didn‚Äôt even attack me, I know he would have done but, my neighbour protected me. The neighbours rang the police. 
Despite me thinking I had been hiding everything for months it seems all of my neighbours knew and all of them had their own story to tell, of hearing me sobbing, crying, begging for my life.   
So... fast forward to today. 
I haven‚Äôt seen him for almost 2 weeks, spoken to him once. I said I recognise him as an abuser, he still can‚Äôt understand this and said you have your version, I have mine‚Äô 
In that instant, I knew. Any more time with him, he would kill me and still, find a way to blame me! 
Of course I‚Äôm sad. It‚Äôs hard. Even at his worst I loved him and believed he would change. 
But suddenly, my eyes are open. He would never have changed. He would eventually kill me. I told him time and time again he would. When he was sober, sometimes he acknowledged this. 
But today, for the first time, I feel stronger, I feel free",It‚Äôs hard but I‚Äôm relieved,[deleted],2020-05-04 18:55:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gdhmxu/its_hard_but_im_relieved/,3,1.0,8,5,496

domesticviolence,"**TL;DR** My friend is in an abusive relationship but refuses to admit it to anyone. She has also been approached by four different people (that I know of specifically, there could be more) telling her that her husband has acted inappropriately towards them **including sexual assault**. 

Full story (Changed names for privacy reasons): Randy has a history of cheating but when him and my friend, Carrie, met he told her that he's changed. About a month before the wedding a woman reached out to Carrie and said that she's been having an affair with Randy (screenshots to prove it) she said that she had no idea he was in a relationship and as soon as she found out she reached out to Carrie. Randy's bestman refused to participate in the wedding after he found out and later decided he wouldn't come to the wedding at all. Randy told Carrie that the girl who had reached out to her was an ex girlfriend who was still obsessed with him and that the screenshots were old. Carrie believed Randy and they got married. 

They moved a roommate into their house and less than a year later the roommate exploded on Randy and moved out saying that he was abusive and that Carrie needed to leave. The roommate said that Randy would freakout on Carrie if all three meals weren't prepared at the exact time he wanted (one night dinner was 10 mintues late so he wouldn't acknowledge her for days), if she didn't clean good enough, if she worked too much and ""neglected him"", that **he would call her fat and force her to workout for hours every day** (she is 5'5"" and 115 pounds), if she didn't have his favorite beer ready for him at the door when he came home from work, and telling her that he'd never have a kid with someone like her cause **she'd be an awful mom since she's an awful wife**. The roommate also said that they would hear Carrie bawling in her room all day long until Randy was due home then Carrie would clean herself up and cook dinner. Carrie also confided in the roommate that a few times before Randy would **get on top of her and start choking her in the middle of the night** and when Carrie would fight him off Randy would claim he was ""sleep walking"" and didn't remember anything. Roommate also said that Randy would watch porn nonstop when he was home. Randy stopped having sex Carrie and said it was because he wasn't attracted to her and **he would only have sex with her if she let him 'rape' her every time**. 

Meanwhile our other friends without knowing this was going on yet, started talking about the weird things that Randy has started doing. A few friends said that he was out of the blue sending them links to extreme bdsm, humiliation, rape, and animal porn. They were saying that he was sending inappropriate messages about how he wanted to have kids with them, how he wanted to suck on their boobs to drink the milk afterwards, that he would try to 'tickle' them anytime he'd see them, and one friend said that during a party where everyone was drunk that Randy **kept grabbing and rubbing her vagina** in the hot tub and she tried to move away but he'd move closer and keep doing it. This girl has been abused in the past and said when he first started touching her, she went into a denial stage and tried to convince herself that they were both drunk and it wasn't actually happening. 

Randy started telling Carrie that she works too much and it's ruining their relationship so she cut down from a full time schedule to a part time schedule. Work offered her a promotion that would pay her about four times the amount she was currently making. She was so excited and told her boss that it's basically a guaranteed yes but she was going to talk to Randy about it first.  The next day she came back in and told her boss that **she wasn't going to take the promotion because it would be bad for her home life** and that she didn't need the money because Randy also works (he doesn't make enough to pay his rent $1800 a month. They have moved in three other roommates, five total people in the house, because they couldn't afford it). She was really bummed but said it was for the best denying the promotion. 

Randy then started **refusing to let Carrie see her friends unless he was there**. Anytime we would invite her to hangout (girls might whoo) he would be there, even last minute on days we knew he worked (trying to avoid him) he'd show up. Our friends would call or text her and almost immediately get weird texts from her husband (leading us to think he tapped her phone). She started having to ask if she could get coffee with us even if he was at work and she had the day off, we would even offer to pay so she wouldn't spend money, but she'd still ask and he'd say no. He told her that we were bad influences so he didn't want her around us. All of us are married with kids, we don't drink, don't smoke, don't party, we all have jobs, we don't give out our unsolicited opinions to anyone, overall none of us are bad people trying to get her to do anything weird (we're all pretty happy and boring people). But he still won't let her see us.

**Randy stopped letting Carrie see her family**. One of her sisters felt something wasn't right and talked to her about it and Randy got mad and said her sister was crazy so she doesn't get to see her family anymore. 

I found out about this stuff and decided to confront her too. She told me that **since she's a Christian that she will not get a divorce**. She denied almost everything but did say they were in Christian based couples therapy. I even told her about the specific things he had done and said to me. He was sending me messages about wanting to ""suck my tits"" and how ""we'd make beautiful babies"" and how (unbeknownst to me, the same night he molested the other girl) **he tried to kiss me and kept forcing me onto his lap**. I made the excuse in my head too that he was drunk and I shouldn't read into it too much. I know it sounds stupid but I really didn't want to think my friend's husband was a bad person at the time. **Carrie told me that I was lying. Then she told me that Randy did those things as a joke. Then she told me that Randy did those things on accident. Then told me again that they never happened. All in the span of 30 minutes.** 

After Carrie and I talked, Randy told her that she needed to cut contact with all her bad influences (he got to decide who). She was told to quit her job (they settled on her working one or two days a month instead), she wasn't allowed to see us, she couldn't see her family, and she has no money since she hardly works. 

**I'm not sure what to do at this point**. I want to help her but she isn't receptive. She's being abused in so many ways but doesn't see it. She's isolated from everyone except him. Her mental health has declined so much. She wanted to get on medication for it but he wouldn't let her because then he couldn't have his guns in the house.

domesticviolence,"Please excuse any poor formatting, this is my first time posting on reddit. 

Basically, my dad is a violent alcoholic, and has been my entire life. They had me when my mother was 18, they broke up for a few years, got back together and had three more kids (15F, 12F &amp; 10M). My dad appears to hate me. I don‚Äôt know why, but I always got the brunt of it. Growing up he would scream at me, call me a c*nt, say I wasn‚Äôt his daughter. He would throw things at me and pull me into the house by my hair. He would also throw stuff at my mom and push her and scream at her. 

When the other kids got older, he got less violent, keeping his drinking to night time, and limited his hatred to me, so it was easier for my mom to ignore. Every now and then she would say she was going to leave him, but she never has. I moved out when I was 17, so it‚Äôs been 6 years, and in that time it seems my dad‚Äôs hatred has turned to my 15 year old sister. She texts me about it, tells me he‚Äôs thrown her dinner at her, or he‚Äôs locked her out of the living room for three days and so on. I can‚Äôt stand this anymore. I could deal with it when it was just me, but my sister has been having panic attacks, and I know she‚Äôll end up with severe mental health issues from this just like I have. 

But this is the problem. I have no idea what to do about this. With my country in lockdown, my mom has been stuck at home with my dad and she‚Äôs saying that she wants to leave him. But she said she called Women‚Äôs Aid and they said that to take him to court to get his name off the lease, he will be told it‚Äôs happening but not made to leave the house, which is obviously dangerous. She was told the only way to get him out of the house was to get a restraining order, but she will need proof that he‚Äôs hit her, which is hard to get. She was also told that even if they get to court, and she and my sister testify against him (my own testimonial would not count because I know longer live there) the case still may be thrown out and he could go back to living there. 

So I guess my question here is - would me reporting the domestic violence from afar do any good? I only have screenshots of messages from my sister, but I feel so helpless watching them live with him, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before he turns on the younger two. 

TLDR: My dad is an abusive alcoholic, my mom was told she can‚Äôt get a restraining order without proof, how can I help when I no longer live there?","My (24F) dad (46) has always been abusive to me, my mom (44) and one of my sisters (15).

I'm sitting here getting annoyed about something my friend said to me when my wife and I visited for the first time since I summoned the courage to spill my guts to them (a married couple who know us both very well). I knew I could trust them, and still believe that to be the case. Perhaps I wasn't explicit enough, but I confessed that I was thinking of leaving and gave my reasons (the name of this sub). The wife was very understanding. The husband, my buddy, didn't seem to understand or possibly believe I could be a victim, but he didn't push it. I left feeling good that I had talked to someone, but a little surprised that this was the reaction they had.

As a result I backed down because I was really less sure than ever. Now what annoyed me was his comment the next time I saw him - ""how are you feeling? *on an even keel?""*

That just suggests to me that he didn't get it, that it was my imagination, and it just pisses me off that the person i trusted really let me down in the end.

Conversely, I have a long distance, long term friend who has been nothing but supportive. perhaps I've been more explicit and my friend can be more objective.

But we had previously agreed to move when I asked him to. I knew he had a place available with his friend which is very close by and he stays there often already. I would never kick him out to the street. I knew he had a good option. Otherwise I would never ask him to move. 
He usually isn‚Äôt this scary. He refuses to communicate. Like every day. To the point where we just can‚Äôt go on because any time there‚Äôs a issue that needs to be discussed and worked out, it doesn‚Äôt get talked about and therefor it doesn‚Äôt get resolved. There are other issues amongst his lack of communication such as drinking and smoking cigarettes every 30 minutes. He has a horrible cough and can barely breathe in the mornings from how much he smokes every day. He smokes in front of me after I‚Äôve told him many times not to. I don‚Äôt smoke. He wouldn‚Äôt stop. So him moving out was the best option for me since he refused to change. He has been inconsiderate for years. I‚Äôve put up with it a long time and it‚Äôs lead to me being very unhappy in life. He just needed to move. Deep down inside I didn‚Äôt want him to move. I still loved him despite the flaws. We had 5 years of beautiful memories together and things were good before. By the logical part of me asked him to move anyway despite what my emotions were telling me. Because I knew that was the right decision for my mental health. We both agreed he‚Äôd move on May 1st. Every time we talked about it it wasn‚Äôt really discussed thoroughly , he would just say ‚Äú yeah yeah I‚Äôm moving May 1st, now leave me alone .‚Äù But once May 1st comes around,  he refuses to leave and it becomes an issue. He sleeps here that night despite me telling him to leave. Then gets mad for me telling him to leave and tries to take the mattress. He gives up and leaves to his new place. It‚Äôs 3 am. He then comes right back 30 min later in a rage because he says he has no blankets over there or some bullshit reason. He sleeps here. I‚Äôm furious but too exhausted to fight and tell him to leave next day immediately. Then it‚Äôs may 2nd and he finally leaves after hours of having to tell him to. He goes and sleeps at his new place. He was gone 24 hrs and I had the most peace I‚Äôve had in years. I thought I‚Äôd be depressed but I wasn‚Äôt. I was so happy about my emotional progress. He had even texted me earlier apologizing and asking how I was. But then... what do ya knooooow... He came in at 4 am in a rage trying to take the mattress again. 

I had to call the police because he was being very aggressive. Even though he didn‚Äôt injure me, he still got physical by throwing me and displayed violence by wrecking the room. He left but threatened to return for the mattress AGAIN! I told him we can arrange to move the mattress during the day AT AN APPROPRIATE hour. I need to move some things off the walls and bookshelves to not bump them with the mattress while moving it. This is really shitty for me and he‚Äôs doing it on purpose to sabotage me. Being in middle of this pandemic, I‚Äôm out of work and already spending my savings on rent in full since he‚Äôs not paying his half anymore... so buying a mattress right now is nearly impossible. Plus I can‚Äôt move a new mattress in here by myself up 3 stories. He‚Äôs doing this to control me so that I give in and tell him to come move back so that he doesn‚Äôt take the mattress away. Yeah NO. I can‚Äôt even hire a mover if I wanted to or have a friend help because of social distancing.  I have no family here to help.
Now he‚Äôs threatening to have the WiFi shut off since it‚Äôs in his name and I give him money for it. I even offered to give him money for it upfront. Due to the temporary social distance laws, they‚Äôre not doing any WiFi installations right now, so shutting it off would mean no WiFi for a while until who knows when. I‚Äôm applying online for remote jobs and NEED wifi for this. I have one lead for one of the remote jobs and I REALLY need this job during this pandemic. I can‚Äôt go work at a grocery store as much as I‚Äôd like to, because I‚Äôm immune compromised and it‚Äôs too risky. I have a small photography business which is my usual job but work is completely on pause now. Another options is to start selling prints online. I need the WiFi to promote my work online. 
He has internet already at his new place. I would open my own account as soon as WiFi installations are allowed again. This is a temporary thing due to the pandemic. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs lashing out like this as if I sabotaged him by having him move. He says I did. I made sure he had a safe place to move into before ‚Äúkicking him out‚Äù. Where as he‚Äôs literally affecting my livelihood. 

He is trying to sabotage me and admits it proudly. After he was here trying to take the mattress at 4 am he left finally. The neighbors woke up from all the yelling and I‚Äôm so embarrassed. After he left, he blew up my phone all night until morning and I haven‚Äôt even had an hour of sleep yet due to being scared of him coming back. The cop said to call them if he returns so they can stand by while he picks up his belongings. I packed them for him already and he refused to take them. Clearly as an excuse to come back. He STILL has keys here  and won‚Äôt give them to me. So he can just walk right in whenever. I contacted my landlord and am waiting to hear from her. He‚Äôs on the lease still, not sure if I mentioned that already. We‚Äôre both on the lease. He‚Äôs broken the lease before by smoking indoors. Many times. But I want him off the lease so that he has zero rights to waltz right in. Sure I can always call the cops if gets aggressive but what if he hurts me before they can get to him. I wasn‚Äôt worried about this before but now that he has shown me he‚Äôs dangerous I‚Äôm so thrown off and didn‚Äôt have a plan for this- I wasn‚Äôt expecting violence. This is all just so overwhelming that I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I want to have peace with him about this and be civil. I had originally planned on being in contact with him once he moved and maybe trying to either be couple still (stupid I know) or just be friends or whatever, but after his violence I cannot.  But I still need to deal with him due to our situation and his belonging being here. I‚Äôm so terrified of what he‚Äôll do next now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. What even are my rights? 
I cannot move from my apartment. Nothing is for rent right now and I have no friends with a place to crash. I‚Äôm from out of state, so I know very few ppl here. Going to my family/home state which is across the country is not an option as I fled from a domestic violence home life there (my dad). I feel like I have no one to turn to. 

He‚Äôs on the lease still and there for has rights. 


Am I just shit out of luck?? Guess I‚Äôll find out once my landlord responds.

domesticviolence,"Hello!! I‚Äôm not exactly sure if this is the place I should be posting. If anyone would like to direct me if they feel this is not the right place I‚Äôd love to here subs you suggest.

Yesterday I officially graduated college! During the majority of my time in college I was in an abusive relationship. Emotionally, verbally , physical, financially abused. It has now been 26 months since I left the relationship and I‚Äôve been  working on the PTSD and all the other problems that I‚Äôve been working on that we‚Äôre a result of the relationship.

I‚Äôve finally gotten to the point where I want a relationship. I have talked to a couple men since leaving my last relationship but none of them were super serious. 

Today I‚Äôm asking, does anyone else feel like they have to tell people that your getting involved with your history of DV? I‚Äôve seen a therapist every week since leaving my abuser and work really hard to cope and understand how to come from such a bad spot. I just get scared that I will do something without even noticing that I do that I may have developed doing in my past relationship with this one and then create issues for a new relationship??

Idk how to explain it, I don‚Äôt want pitty from them but I feel guilty for not telling them. I‚Äôve casually dated a guy last summer and one time he reached out to move my hair out my face and I flinched really hard because I thought he was going to hit me. He kept asking why I did that, as it has happened a few times.
 I wasn‚Äôt really comfortable sharing with him why I had flinched yet so I never ended up telling him. Idk I‚Äôm just really worried, I feel ready to be in a new relationship but I‚Äôm scared my last one will create issues with any new relationship I have.

Sorry I‚Äôm kind of scattered brained, I just needed to put these thought out somewhere and see if people feel the same. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane overthinking this.","Fellow survivors, can you help me?",peachie-pr1ncess,2020-05-04 01:50:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gd2p0n/fellow_survivors_can_you_help_me/,3,0.81,3,6,353

domesticviolence,"Hi all, I‚Äôm not one to use Reddit much, but I need some guidance. My younger sister (20F) has been in an abusive relationship for 3 years. We have finally gotten her to escape after he beat her one last time. She has driven to where I live, which is 4 hours away from our home. Mind you I only live 4 hours away for college. 

She told her friend and I that she has PTSD and we believe it. She barely sleeps and is always on edge. I went to cuddle up next to her and she almost punched me since she thought it was someone else. His beatings and emotional abuse has surpassed what any human should go through. 

Today, is her first true day of her leaving him and going away. How can I approach her to start changing her phone number, credit card, PSN and even her car?  We are scared that even with her car he can go to her school and hurt her. Her car is very noticeable and it‚Äôs one of the first things she must change when she does return back home. At this point, her friend and I are also talking to her so she can transfer uni and come to my uni or another one far away from home. This is all a lot and any guidance would be amazing. 

P.S. I went through her PS4 and I found all his threatening messages and blocked him. I took pictures of everything he has ever done to her. I hope she starts seeing that she needs to make him to go jail for a long time. The bruises will fade and he has done everything to brain wash her to think that my mom and I are evil. As she sees that good things are coming I hope she realizes that he was a pos and deserves to go to jail. I hope and pray she goes back to her first track and major and continues to strive to be a physician. He made her change her major 5 different times and would force her to not even go to school and stuff. Ugh this is so much, but at least I have my baby sister with me once again.

domesticviolence,"Ive been with her for nearly two years now. Things started off weird and she really didnt connect, blaming a past dv relationship with someone else. Since then, we got closer and I moved in with her and her daughter. As time went on, I began to realize what has been happening and am stuck in this bad place and feel like I cant leave without something bad happening. 

Since we started dating, I found out she had been lying about her dv relationship (on top of her just being a pathological liar). Also, she controls my social life and has been even affecting my work. I often help out at her business, which has now turned into a second full time job where I work 18 hours a day (no joke). She controls everything and will even keep me from my car. I just feel like I walk on eggshells all the time and I can't tell her no or she wont speak to me. Our ‚Äúhome‚Äù consists of pictures of her and her daughter and none of us and i have three drawers while she has a full walk in closet. She also makes me use the guest bathroom downstairs. She even has her daughter yell at me when she‚Äôs upset me, but I know if I leave, she will use her to get me back. I feel like I am here to serve her and everything I want to do is not a priority. She even says that if I leave her, she will kill me. I wish this was everything but there‚Äôs a lot more.

This time it did though, but then Friday came and he posted on Facebook that he was abusive towards women and he thought everyone should know (mind you I hadn‚Äôt broken up with him yet) people were commenting saying it wasn‚Äôt true and making jokes out of it. I don‚Äôt take lightly to abuse I was sexually assaulted 4 different times in my life, and my mom was a master manipulator( also I should mention my parents passed away in March ;( )so I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of anger and depression, but to him it‚Äôs just an excuse. But anyway I got off track I commented on the post my side of things and put him on blast. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but for him to think he deserved pity was astonishing to me. Then EVERYONE attacked me saying I shouldn‚Äôt piss him off because he‚Äôs not that kinda of person, and even his friend that I‚Äôve hung out with, said I was the bad guy and eventually it would be shown, and that I pushed him there and he called me stupid just a bunch of mean stuff.

domesticviolence,"Hi, my SO and I have been together for 3+years now and living with each other for 1 year. There were red flags already when we just started our relationship -- SO punches walls, throws things,  shouts and cusses at me, when angry. After our first year, SO became more violent towards me. When we fight, SO stands by the door to prevent me from leaving, punches me, slaps me. SO also choked me multiple times to the point that I almost blacked out. There are times when SO also threw things (shoe, phone) at me. SO tells me that she acts this way because I don't talk to her when I am angry. The reason why I refuse to speak with her is because I know that I tend to say hurtful words when I am angry. Im also scared that she would hurt me again. Aside from being violent, SO also cheated on me twice before but I dont want to delve in this issue. 

I have tried breaking up with her multiple times. She always cry hysterically and hurt herself (punch herself, bang her head on the floor /wall , etc) in front of me. Recently, she threatened to kill herself and locked herself  inside our bathroom with a knife. I was so scared so I sad that I will stay. She told me that when she kills herself, I am the only person to blame.

domesticviolence,"It‚Äôs hard to find the balance between being a psychology student, and also having ptsd from an extremely abusive relationship sometimes. 

My ex destroyed so much of my life. I had to put my studies on hold for two years, because the abuse was affecting my grades and then to start recovering from said abuse after leaving. 

This is my first year back at uni since 2017, and I‚Äôm dedicated. I‚Äôm *finally* in a place where I can completely devote myself to my studies. I‚Äôm in my final year, so the grades have a significant impact on my future. Still, I didn‚Äôt think the first assignment after my break would be on fucking domestic abuse. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was an incredibly interesting study. It looked at the links between the Dark Tetrad of Personality (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, sadism) and whether each trait predicted the perpetration of Coercive Controlling Violence, and Relational Aggression, respectively. 

Reading prior literature in preparation killed me. I had to take it so slow, with lots of breaks. And then when it came time to writing the report, and running/analysing the data, I kind of switched into fight or flight mode - my psychiatrist called it ‚ÄúIsolation of Affect‚Äù. I was basically able to switch off the ptsd side of my brain in order to write a killer report. I worked on it from 9am - 7pm for most of the last month. The stress helped distract me from my emotions regarding the subject, and just general life emotions. 

The report is finished now, and I‚Äôm really proud of the final product. But I don‚Äôt have anything to distract me anymore. The crash is fucking *hard*. After being in such a heightened state for a prolonged period of time, my mood is through the floor. My ptsd is flaring up *so* badly, because the impact of everything I‚Äôve read and written has truly started to sink in. Everything feels like it‚Äôs too much. 

Still, I have to be grateful that I‚Äôm even at this point - the point at which I am safe and no longer fearing for my life; had *just* enough trauma therapy to cope; and the fact that my coping skills are on point. I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to this point if it weren‚Äôt for my psychiatrist and two therapists, and I thank them everyday. Yes, I got myself out of that situation, but they gave me my life back by teaching me how to cope with such patience. 

Anyway. That‚Äôs my ramble. I‚Äôm proud of myself, but fucking exhausted. I hate that this isn‚Äôt just another ‚Äútopic‚Äù for me - that I actually have personal experience. But it is what it is. And hopefully I‚Äôll get to the point where it doesn‚Äôt impact me as much as it still does. 

For those interested in the results of the study, it was found that when combined, age, gender, and the Dark Tetrad significantly predicted the perpetration of Coercive Controlling Violence and Relational Aggression. Both psychopathy and sadism were unique predictors of Coercive Controlling Violence, while gender, sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism uniquely predicted Relational Aggression.

*EDIT*: I know there were comments asking to read my report before they got deleted. I appreciate the sentiment and the interest - while it does go against sub rules which align with me wanting to keep at least some level of anonymity, I‚Äôm also not allowed. The assignment hasn‚Äôt been graded yet, so posting it/sending it to people creates the very real risk that my assignment will be flagged for plagiarism.

And yet, I‚Äôm still weirdly jealous. For extra context I‚Äôm also actually a gay woman so even if he was a lovely guy I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to date him.

He flipped the couch that I was trying to sleep on &amp; then flipped it on top of me. I proceeded to stand up, very confused and he quickly made his way to me and picked me up and pressed me against the wall, screaming at me. I reverted to a passive mode because that was the only logical thing I thought to do for my own safety. I had to coddle him for the next hour because I was afraid he would rage out again. He left within the next two hours. So my question is, in your best thoughts/idea, what happened? Will he do this again? Technically we didn‚Äôt break up but there has been no contact since. Is there any chance it was a one time thing or should I get out for good?

domesticviolence,"I got into a very serious relationship, at a very young age, with a extremely mentally ill person, a few years my senior. Extremely abusive, ""raised"" in a cult like environment. I don't know that the abusive was intentional at the beginning, (my therapist said this is the Stockholm talking) but once they saw that was a power they had, they sure used it.

I can now identify red flags that I couldn't at that time. I know, that there was abuse from the start, but they quite literally rewired my head, and although I know it's true they were abusive, it's not something I can truly feel, believe, or connect with.

They helped me grow and learn, a lot with my PTSD, from childhood, but as they helped, anything they learned along the way was then doubled back as a means to attack and rewire me.

Triggers were used in arguments if things weren't going their way, stuff like that.

Their family started feeding me psychedelics at the beginning of this, and messing with my head. This continued throughout the next three years. I was 16, freshly emancipated, working 50 hours a week while trying to complete highschool, and pay my rent and other bills, living with this partner.

I dropped out, and spiraled, bad, over the next three years. My mental health deteriorated, I was cut off from friends and family if they didn't serve him and his motives, I was told I was stealing his friends, etc. By the end of our time together I was not able to function, in any sense.

From the beginning I had to buy their affection. If we went out, I paid for the meal, and gas, they would barely talk to me, spend time on their phone, etc. This was the foundation of the entire relationship.

I was encouraged, not to progress in life-but the manipulation was so, so, so, smooth, that I didn't understand. There were many thoughts I had, that seemed organic, but we're actually put into my head (I'm not sure if this makes sense. I'll try to describe it better if it doesn't).

I wasn't allowed to go places without them, but they didn't enjoy going out. This eventually translated into me not being allowed to have a job, but being scum for sitting at home all day, or being scum for working all the time and not spending time with them.

If we fought he would disconnect the internet, cut off the service to my phone so I couldn't contact anyone, wait until I had a panic attack and would crawl back to them in the bedroom.

I suffered a severe injury and couldn't walk for over a month, and they refused to help, with the dog, with the apartment, food, anything.

They would encourage my binge eating, fasting, and other self destructive behaviors. 

They also has issues with chronic masturbation and objectification. I was not aware of the chronic masturbation until the last 3 months of our relationship. We were together 3 years, I don't understand how they hid it.

This brings me to my original point of posting: the objectification, has really messed me up mentally. When we would sleep at night, they would hold me sososo tight, I couldn't breathe. I would wake up multiple times having to readjust so I could.

I suffered from a lot of sexual abuse as a child, and it took me years to overcome that and love my body. I know it doesn't matter to others, that the guys I'm with probably won't notice or care, but I do, and I feel fucking disgusting, my skin is constantly crawling, and I feel like every sense of myself that I had has been torn away.

The verbal abuse was really bad. They told me they wished I would get raped again, I should kill myself, no one was going to want me, I was gross, disgusting, ew, told me I made them want to kill themselves, etc.

When we would have sex they would restrict my movements, and whatnot, so they could finish. Then I was shamed for not doing anything during sex. By 5 months in, I couldn't enjoy it. I started dissociating severely during sex, which has translated into my everyday life. They used BDSM as manipulation as well.

They never once finger me, or touched me, probably went down on me 5 times in the 3 years we were together. They would tell me I was selfish if I asked.

I started self harming early into the relationship, and they would watch. Towards the end I locked myself in a bathroom, cutting my leg, and called the crisis unit. Where I was turned away due to a shortage of beds.

I ended up stopping my birth control so I didn't have to have sex with them.

A month before the end of our relationship, I tried to check myself into a mental hospital. The nurse sent them into the waiting room but I couldn't verbalize that I was being abused. They told me I would have to try to kill myself for admittance.

To me, in the mental state I was in, this was game on, I'll take enough acid to drive myself crazy, and then I'll be away from them for good, because I'll be insane, locked up, and that was better.

We did drugs with their parents, who were extremely sexually suggestive, and messed up in every sense. I took two tabs of acid, and was then offered two more, I was trying to drive myself crazy so I took it, planned on taking more

They refused therapy time and time again and I never understood it. I have a better idea as to why now. 

That was interrupted by my then partner, cracking mentally. I identified it before his family did, maybe they were ignoring it, I'm not sure. He picked me up, squeezing me as tightly as he did at night. Calling me ""it"" and ""mine"" looking through me. Their mom told them that they had to let me go, like the cats, dogs, and bunnies, from his childhood, and if I loved them I'd go back to them. That's literally a psychopath line from a movie. I'm aware. She was saying it legitimately. I hid behind their stepdad, and then made eye contact with them. They were not looking through me when we made eye contact. They saw me, and proceeded to tackle me to the ground, strangling me, humping me, calling me it and mine, trying to take my clothes off. I started to lose concious and their stepdad ripped them off me, to my surprise. The rest of the night was strange. It was like they had a protocol for what happened.

I'm just so lost. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do. I know I shouldn't feel the way I do, but I still feel this way, I constantly feel like I'm pushing myself too much or too little, I physically cannot cry, even though I want to. I have little to no support system and I feel uncomfortable trying to make new connections due to all this. There's not good domestic violence resources in my area, and I'm not sure if that's the proper resource to reach out to.

I really just need some support and to connect with someone-on any aspect of this.

domesticviolence,"I broke up with my abusive ex-boyfriend a few months ago, then things got complicated because we were quarantined together. Now, thankfully, we are in separate houses. I created this reddit account specifically for the purpose of accessing this forum so any context you feel might be helpful can be found in my post history.

We have been speaking semi-regularly about the abuse he put me through and he has been listening to me and responsive so far. The purpose of this hasn't been to get back together, I'm just trying to get him in touch with my feelings and the impact of his behaviour so that at the right time I can suggest he joins a perpetrator program. I know this is  bad decision for myself but I am doing it because I don't want him to abuse someone else again. I will back off if/when it poses danger to my emotional health or safety.

We've also been talking about other things between these conversations. Usually just catching up, but sometimes we have opened up to each other about things going on in our lives. His Dad used to abuse his Mum when he was a kid, they divorced, and he's remarried now. Recently he and his Mum have been talking about it. He's found out things that his Dad did that have horrified him. He's trying to reconcile these things with wanting a relationship with his Dad. He thinks his Dad has changed but from what little I know, he hasn't - he's negligent of his children, deeply selfish, and always puts other people down. Maybe the physical abuse has stopped (and maybe it hasn't - how would we know without asking his wife?), but I don't think he has become a caring person that regrets his behaviour.

Usually in this situation I would point the person towards resources that would help them to understand. Without a doubt, I'd ask them to read 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft so that they can understand the type of person they're dealing with. But doing that in this context would feel... weird? I don't know whether I'd feel comfortable encouraging him to reach out when he could use those resources as a weapon against someone later on in his life. Like, if he read that book, he'd have time to think of ways to discredit it, or could name ways in which his next partner is 'abusing' him. And I'm worried that if he has information on the process of how victims recover from domestic violence, he could try to sabotage his next girlfriend's recovery. I am worried that he will turn some of these things against me. I am also skeptical of his motivations for telling me anything - whilst I wholeheartedly believe him and empathise, is he choosing to tell *me* so that I feel sorry for him because he's 'in love' with me? But then, as a childhood victim of domestic violence, surely he's entitled to these resources? It isn't up to me to decide and it feels wrong that I wouldn't treat him the same as any other abuse victim.

To add to my concerns, my ex-boyfriend has been arguing a lot with his Mum and has hinted to me that she is selfish, can't let things go, overreacts to things, and he is worried about her mental health. These are all things he used to say about me. I am concerned that he might be emotionally abusing his Mum. If he is actively abusing someone, my concerns about helping him are heightened.

At the moment I just nod and listen and try to be understanding but I stay quiet about any resources that I think could help his situation and haven't mentioned the book. It makes me feel kind of guilty. I don't know if I am the right person for him to talk to about this because of this conflict of interest, but then equally, if he spoke to someone else, they wouldn't have any knowledge of how abusive he is, which feels... relevant?

domesticviolence,"19F

This is very long. Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub or if I upset anyone. Essentially I'm living in a mild domestic violence situation.

My narcissistic mother abused me and my brother as kids. She physically abused me until 14 (where she only stopped because my school got involved), but she still verbally abuses us and treats everyone like shit really.

I coped reasonably well though heavily traumatized. My brother (16) did not, and has gotten increasingly violent over the years. My brother has ADHD and it's probably the reason why he can't control himself that well; he paces around a lot, bursts into a run sometimes, and does hand stimming typical of people with autism/ADHD. My parents do not accept his ADHD diagnoses and think anything related to mental health is BS. So they never got him any help.

In his last year of high school his grades dropped, he got pressured into smoking, and got expelled because he made very offensive memes about his teachers online. This is around the time he began breaking objects and assaulting our mother. He failed one O-level on purpose so he would have no choice but to go to an alternative 6th form that was stereotyped as 'easy' but in fact demanded just as much work as other 6th forms.

Before first year was even over, he flunked most of his subjects and basically decided he didn't want to attend 6th form. After many assaults and talking it through, he decided to start working. But then COVID hit, and he was still apprehensive about full-time work despite deciding that he didn't want to attend school for the time being.

As of now he's broken about 20 items in the house and assaulted our mother and gotten kicked out countless times. Many times he won't leave the house after an assault and my dad has to grapple with him to force him out. Last Christmas day he assaulted our mother at Christmas lunch in front of all our other family.

We never know when he'll snap or what will trigger him. Though he seems to get triggered over even valid criticism, and sometimes it's so random I'm sure he just does it to hurt our mother. He has told me that she deserves it and he loves it when she's in pain.

For a long time the feud was with my brother and my parents, and we weren't fighting between each other, just barely tolerated each other. But now I'm sure he hates me because he's jealous of how I'm moving forward in my life and am preferred by my parents. These days I can't say anything to him without him blowing up. I've already accidentally gotten my mum assaulted and him kicked out about 5 times. Recently I tried to avoid conversation with him, but he started the conversation, and in seconds it ended with a jar of peanut butter getting smashed, mother assaulted, and him kicked out.

My parents have never called the police on him because they're afraid of staining his police record for life. They've tried to get him to go to therapy or anger management many times but he refused. They can't get a court order for him to go to therapy because that means his assaults will be on his record. They've tried to talk about him and his future, so have our grandparents and uncle. Our uncle worked with him for weeks to write his CV and to give him advice on career and school options.

My parents hope in vain that he'll change when he starts working full time and earning income, but with COVID it's a long way away. And he's assaulted 3 times while my parents simply tried to help him apply for a COVID government grant. They swear they'll kick him out once he turns 18 because they won't be legally responsible for him anymore. But I doubt they'll have the guts to evict him completely.

At this point, any sympathy I had for him, or any hope I had that he could change, has left me. I see him as a pure asshole, someone who will never get anywhere in life, a time bomb that I just want removed from this house. Sometimes I fear he might end up assaulting me if I say the wrong thing. What's even worse, is that I'm not like my mother; my instinct will be to fight back. And my parents are afraid that since I am an adult and he's a minor, I will end up prosecuted even in the case of pure self defense.

I talk to a therapist but he doesn't know the full severity of it. I'm afraid that if I become completely honest he'll have no choice but to call the police on my family. That would result in: no conviction because my parents won't want to stain his record, and my whole family against me.",There is no way out of my situation and I think it's turned me into a monster.,_humanERROR_,2020-05-01 16:12:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gbkzxg/there_is_no_way_out_of_my_situation_and_i_think/,3,1.0,3,17,817
domesticviolence,"I left my emotionally and sexually abusive husband mid-november last year. If anyone is interested, I shared my story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/dzed7w/ashamed_and_afraid_the_hes_right/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

Over the last couple days my ex has been popping up everywhere, friends social media posts, online profiles that have been dormant, divorce dealings, and even a potential run in at the grocery store (because of wearing face masks due to COVID-19, I can't be sure it was him I saw).

My mind has responded by playing a loop of our relationship and I've come to a couple realizations.

I've opened up to some of my friends and they've shared with me some things that have made me real my concept of ""normal"" was so drastically skewed. I lived in a world where if I wasn't interested sex that night, or if we'd had a fight, or I ""forced"" him to be social, a blow job was expected. If he was having trouble sleeping, if he had a fight with his mom, if he had a bad day at work, etc.

Blow jobs were the ""minimal"" effort.

He was interested in BDSM. But I'm now remembering things that I'm realizing should have been red flags. He bought a pair of handcuffs and instantly broke off the safety latch and hid the keys. When I asked why he broke off the latch, the response was well it would be too easy for you to get out of them. And even though I would sometime mention how they would dig into my wrists, eventually the fuzzy wrapping on them disappeared, meaning they dug into my wrists more and on least one occasion made me bleed.

He liked arm binders. But when I mentioned they were hurting me the response was you just aren't willing to be uncomfortable. On a good day the best I would hope for with those was that they would only cause my arms to fall asleep with pins and needles.

Gags were again just an accepted part of any sexual encounter (against my wishes). And I learned to not complain about them hurting because it meant they would be tightened. I remember more often than not having sores caused by the gags, and again on multiple occasions them being so tight they cut into my lips and made the corner of my mouth bleed.

These were the things that I accepted for normal... this doesn't cover the things that I was able to identify as abusive behavior when I left him.

I think I must have cried after at least 25% of our sexual encounters. And during at least 10%. I felt so humiliated, and dehumanized. I felt like I was so out of control and so trapped. I was made to feel like I was selfish and ungiving when it came to sex.

On the occasions I cried, he would apologize but the next day it started all over again. After years, at the end, I asked him how he thought it was okay that I would lock myself away and cry after our sexual encounters. He told me he thought I cried at everything, and there were so many worse things in the world that I should put this in context, at least I'm not a child soldier (no kidding that's what he said).

I'm so glad to be out of that relationship, I'm so much happier away from him. But I get angry, and sad, when I think of the years he took from me, the trauma that will never fully go away, and the fear of being in a relationship, the unfair assumption that all men act like this.

I still find myself apologizing for him. I'm still ashamed, I'm so afraid to speak ill of him to people who know him. I'm terrified that if I open up even a little about how much he hurt me, they won't believe me or will still choose him.

domesticviolence,"My partner and I have been together for roughly two years and I‚Äôve faced consistent emotional abuse (although nothing extremely severe) and a few more recent acts of violence, one resulting in an arrest. We‚Äôve had ongoing conflict over the past few months exclusively centered around the consequences that have come from my reporting the attacks. I have tried to leave many times but I feel way too emotionally dependent to cut them off fully, especially in the midst of quarantine. We go to the same school, work at the same place, have the same social group, etc. It feels impossible to escape. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. The last violent attack happened almost 3 months ago. There‚Äôs been threats and heated arguments since, but nothing violent. But I still become terrified at even the slightest hint of anger/annoyance/any emotion in their voice and I find myself constantly worrying, overthinking everything I do to avoid starting something. I dissociate frequently and can‚Äôt control it, it mostly happens during sex and my partner does not stop which makes me extremely uncomfortable but I am absolutely terrified of saying something about it because I don‚Äôt know how they will react. 

As I said, we go to the same college and we currently live in separate apartments. A few months ago, before anything got violent, we signed a lease for a place together for the next school year. It starts in July. Because we have been on good terms recently and are still actively trying to be together, we have both acted under the assumption that we will still be moving in together. But I‚Äôm having second thoughts now (that I‚Äôve had for a while, even before signing this lease, because I always had a bad feeling). Every time I think about it I panic, every time it gets brought up in conversation I have no idea what to say because I can‚Äôt admit that I don‚Äôt know how to be comfortable living with them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have nowhere else to go and no way out of this lease, and I don‚Äôt want to start a huge fight with them by bringing up my concerns. I need to feel safe in my own home and I don‚Äôt even feel that now, knowing how quickly things can change with them, so I don‚Äôt know if I ever will having to co-exist 24/7.

My best friend (20yr old) recently moved in with her abusive boyfriend, they fought constantly before they moved in and he would break multiple things and threaten to kill himself or crash their car.  As of recent, she didn't express concern of the relationship (although I knew she was in denial). Tonight She called me crying and barely being able to form a sentence she asked if she could come over and ofc I welcomed her to stay the night. Almost an hour had passed as I was calling her phone was unavailable. My mind was racing I knew something wasn't right I hopped in the car to drive to her place I was starting to worry that things had got out of hand. I received messages from her boyfriend's friend account that she had managed to get a hold of. She told me she hid in the bathroom and was throwing up. Concerned I waited I wasn't leaving without her or to see her, She asked me to pick up her broken phone which he had thrown off their balcony. He had multiple friends over and they just blindly ignored the violent situation that unfolded in the apartment. Once she found a way out we talked in my car she broke down and told me he has threatened to stab her and her family if she left or broke up with him. We sat and talked for 2 hours I begged for her to come home with me but she wouldn't she was more scared of him hurting her family than her.  He also consumed a Xanax and smoked some weed (which is a regular occurrence)  and was out of it when she returned back to the room. He degraded her and forced her sexually. She told me wants to leave but is scared and confused I've been researching services and hotlines to help her get the help she needs but it still feels a bit helpless.

Since then I met somebody else and just my luck he's abusive to. Not so much physically but mentally and emotionally and like threatening suicide and threatening me lose my kids. And then on top of that I was hoping to use stimulus check to get away so I decided to use some self income as a way to file my taxes cuz I thought only tax filers were going to get it and I guess I did something wrong I don't know because it says still processing on my tax return which means I'm not eligible for the stimulus because I don't know I have to wait for a letter from the IRS I try to call and there's no live person you can talk to. And on top of that I have nobody to talk to no family no friends. I just wish I can get on the phone with somebody from the IRS to see what I need to do to fix my return so I can get my money and get away. I have a 8 year old boy 7 year old girl 5 year old boy in 3 year old girl and I do not want my girls to grow up thinking it's okay for a man to treat them the way that they've seen me be treated and I don't want my boys to grow up thinking it's okay to treat a woman like that or anybody.

domesticviolence,"For years he had abused me. I didn‚Äôt really see it as that, but perhaps ‚Äòthat‚Äô was what it was? 
He was arrested in 2018. He pulled a knife out on me, following months of physical assaults. Even that wasn‚Äôt enough. He was arrested after he attacked me one night and my daughter rang the police. I understood what he did was not right and, went along with the prosecution until social services got involved and said they were placing my children under a Section and could take my children away for not safeguarding them!! I dropped all charges, I didn‚Äôt want SS in our lives. 
Seven months from his arrest, restraining order lifted he got in touch. Obviously he was sorry.. had changed... all of the expected! Stupidly, I fell for it. Convinced all those closest to us to give him another chance... he had changed... fat chance of that. 
Reality was, he found better ways to disguise it. Began slow and soon built up. I thought I hid it well. Until this week, in the middle of lockdown. He stood in the street and threatened to stab me, in front of all our neighbours and friends.. and then, threatened to stab and kill them. So drunk he probably couldn‚Äôt remember his name. He then, jumped in his vehicle and drove off. Was soon caught, crashed into a wall and refused to give a breath test. Obviously he was arrested and threw into a cell. Police involved, I haven‚Äôt pressed charges. But it seems I didn‚Äôt need too. One neighbour has reported hearing my cries as he called me a slag and hit me, the other neighbour reported witnessing his behaviour towards me, all heard him say he will kill me and, the worst, I mean the very worst is my teenage daughter reported witnessing him beat me and push me down the stairs. 
I didn‚Äôt know she saw it. 
I can‚Äôt even begin to describe my guilt. 
I feel like a complete idiot that my friends and neighbours know this was happening. 
I thought I hid it. It seems I didn‚Äôt even do that very well.",Only my nightmare,[deleted],2020-04-29 21:26:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gai4hv/only_my_nightmare/,2,1.0,7,3,358
domesticviolence,"Hi guys, I've never posted here before but after finding this, I really felt the need to! I don't really know the purpose of this post, I guess I want to finally get so much off my chest, maybe ask a few questions to people who have always made it out, etc. 

I don't want this to be super long but for context, I'll describe a little about what happened to me.
I was 19 when I met him, he was 20. We met online and I was definitely naive when it came to dating.
We lived a pretty big distance away but the way he spoke immediately caught my attention, I was absolutely obsessed. While I had dated a little before, I'd never felt so drawn to someone, I now realise that like a lot of things, that intensity he made me feel wasn't typical or particularly healthy.

He told me that he loved me after the first week, which seems shocking to type but at the time, I took it as a huge compliment. 

Skip ahead 4 months and he asked me to move in with him, very sudden. Already, there had been red flags, which I found myself ignoring or making excuses for. He would lose his shit if I didn't answer the phone to him whilst I was at work, that kind of thing. The first time he made me cry was before this point, actually. I had stayed over his for the weekend and we had missed the alarm to wake up and when he finally did wake, he started screaming at me, calling me a ""stupid bitch"". I was scared and in shock, I'd never seen this side. The dead, shark eyes that glared at me, which I'd see more and more frequently throughout the relationship. I don't know why but even that early on, I told myself it was out of character and just let it slide. I think, to be quite honest, a lot of my reaction to his abuse came from having an emotionally abusive step father growing up.
I felt pressured to move to his city, a place where I knew nobody. His justification was that it was super cheap and he already had his own home, whereas I still lived with parents. The way he spoke about it made it seem like a fairytale and I just couldn't wait, so I gave up my job, friends and everything I knew.

I moved in the November and things seemed somewhat smooth. Little things bothered me, such as feeling very responsible for all the housework and such. I had little questions in the back of my mind, he would tell me he'd been part of the army which made no sense whatsoever (and I feel embarrassed to admit that I took his word for it at first) and how he had managed to get a beautiful home so young, etc.

Then a week before Christmas day, I found out he'd been cheating from the moment we started dating. As in, he was literally arranging to have sex with women the moment I left our first date. I was broken in a way I'd never felt before and the pain kept coming. It was constant. I am not exaggerating when I say that every day, I found new messages to women. He had multiple dating site accounts, Facebooks, things like that. I lost my damn mind, I felt like a crazy person, I would incessantly check his social media and the anxiety never stopped because I was always finding more and more things, I couldn't sleep, rarely ate, it got so awful that I lost my job because instead of working, I would stay at the home to try and ""prevent"" him cheating.

I guess my first question is here, I feel still so traumatised from the cheating, will I always feel this way? I do engage in mental health services, btw. At the moment, I am so scared to date again, I don't want to push my insecurities and trauma onto another man because of what I've been through.

This is where the gaslighting and emotional abuse got worse, it went from fake crying to ""it's your fault for X reason"", I genuinely felt suicidal. 
After a period of calling him out for what he was doing, the physical abuse started. I remember sitting in the bedroom and he slapped me so hard, I sat back on the bed in awe. I felt nothing, almost. Not fear, not anger, just empty. I couldn't speak. I always thought I'd be the type to fight back or get out straight away but I didn't. I loved him and partly, it was pride, I'd ignored my family and friends to move in with him and I didn't want to admit that things had become to horrid. 

He proposed not long after. I hate that I still feel so much shame typing all this out, I feel so stupid, I accepted his proposal. 

From here, the physical abuse increased. Over the 4 years, I was slapped, punched, strangled, hit with glass, so many things. 
To be honest, I still feel disassociated from these events. I remember the actions but there's almost no emotion attached, sometimes I have panic attacks but that's rare. Mostly, it's just a numbness, is this typical? 

During my time with him, I discovered his family were just as toxic. They knew of his abuse (and later, I found out they knew of his abuse towards others), and would frequently tell me to call them if he beat me, not the police. 
He had worked very hard to separate me from my family and friends, so really, the only people I had around me were he and his family. This really warped my sense of reality. I stopped having my own thoughts, I believed whatever they said and I constantly questioned my own sanity. 
Having now left, I find there are people who struggle to believe my story because they cannot wrap their heads around how my ex wasn't the only abuser, it was his family too, has anyone else had this experience? 
I find it difficult to process the whole reality of it myself, how it is possible that the whole family were just as evil as eachother? 

The emotional abuse was so awful. I can't truly describe it, I lost myself completely. I rarely went outside, my anxiety was constant, I couldn't sleep, and the more my mental health declined, the more he would display it to people, ""you see how unwell she is, I'm trying to support her"", making himself seem like the wonderful, supportive partner and not the cause. 
His family would constantly make comments that they didn't know what was wrong with me, that I was selfish for being so damaged, and one even accused me of having the devil inside of me. 
I felt so, so alone. I was utterly convinced that there was no point leaving, nobody would believe me, that I was the ""crazy girl"". 

One of my motivators for leaving was having a child with him. A decision I regret but I love my child dearly, I just wish it had been with a good man. 
Shortly after our child was born, I was diagnosed with PPD, and had to endure many threats towards my child's safety. 
My ex's family tried to tell people that I was a ""cold, uncaring"" mother because I struggled to connect with my child, the violence and abuse I was going through made me feel disconnected with everything around me. 
Social services became involved and to my horror, this is how I learned my ex was a sex offender. Everyone knew but me. 

How can I even learn to trust again when such huge things were hid from me so easily with my ex? Am I an idiot? I really just don't know, my trust in people as a whole is so broken. 

Over the years, I had wanted to escape. The trauma bond was so strong, I was convinced this man was my soulmate, despite everything. In a way, I think it was easier to believe that I was the one in the wrong than admit that I'd wasted years with a monster. I blamed myself for so much of what was happening. 
After the birth of my child, the information I had found out, I started to seek support. 
I know how this sounds, that I should have left the moment my child was born but it was so hard. I was terrified. 

In June 2019, I sat in bed writing my ex another letter of how he could change for the better and I stopped. It hit me so hard that he didn't care. How many notes had I written over the years? I stayed up all the night as he slept, got dressed in the morning and told him I was meeting a friend for a coffee.
He was fine with it. He never stopped me from socialising as such, as he knew it would arouse suspicion, he just made me feel so awful about myself that I had developed massive social anxiety and felt unable to leave (and frequent beatings when returning from the rare trips out).
I went to the police station and broke down. I kept apologising to the officers. They interviewed me, video interviewed me, and arrested him.

One of my worries is that I didn't explain everything in the police interview? Some parts I left out because I was so panicked that I wasn't thinking clearly, I wanted it to be as comprehensive as possible but I couldn't recall so much in the state I was in. Will that work against me in court? I really have never been through something like this before.

My child was thankfully being looked after by a member of my family when these events were taking place.
I was in the police station for hours, he was held overnight. I went back to the home we shared alone. At first, I felt a rush of relief but that quickly turned into panic, I was distraught. Would he kill me for turning him in? What was going to happen to me? I am so ashamed to admit this but at 3-4am, I frantically telephoned every police contact I'd been given, leaving messages to ""please let X come home, I can't do this.""
I did speak with an officer the day after who explained my reaction was quite common but I still worry that it made me look like a liar? Because I'd reported him for such vile crimes and I begged for him to be allowed home.

The next day, his family visited me. They were encouraging me and my child to stay in the city, away from my family, in a women's hostel (in a part of the city I'd never visited). While explaining what had happened, his mother casually interrupted and asked if I had a hair brush she could use. Such a small, stupid thing but it woke me up, in a way, to see that she didn't care one bit. She wasn't even listening. Her only contribution was to add that my ex, her son, should kill himself. 
The moment she left, I called my family and started packing, within the hour I was back in my hometown with my child.

The reactions to me coming home have been mixed and I find it so difficult to deal with. I have been told by family, ""if it was as bad as you say, you would have left sooner."" Some family members treat me like I'm an alien, tiptoeing around me, not knowing how to speak to me. It makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.
Thankfully, many people have been so wonderful and supportive.

My ex has not contacted me since, though he did access my emails while there was a temporary restraining order in place, which I did inform the police but nothing happened.
Sometimes I question my sanity because I read so, so many stories about how the abusive ex stalks and never forgets about the victim but in my case, this hasn't happened. Don't get me wrong, I am beyond thankful but it makes me question myself- how could he have been so abusive if he's just allowing me to get on with my life? That's not what abusers do, is it? Does that make any sense?

My life has changed dramatically. I have a stable job, my own home, and a beautiful social life. I thought I would never cope without him. I thought I'd be a shell and my mother commented on how when she saw me for the first time again, I looked devoid of life, barely spoke or moved, wouldn't make eye contact.
I am so blessed for how things are. I never thought I'd feel the way I do now, I've become so loud and I'm proud to be who I am. 

However, I am left with so many questions and confusion.
I want to move on from what happened but I'm scared to forget what happened. I don't know why. I want to remember, almost like if I can remember, I have better chance of getting into that situation with someone else, you know?
I feel so alone, I truly cannot see myself dating again. I don't know how, I feel like if I open up about what I've been through, men will be horrified and want nothing to do with me.
I don't know when the nightmares will stop, I get triggered by the smallest of things sometimes.
How do I explain to my child?
And the one I am most disgusted to admit, why do I still feel love for this man? Attraction? I still have horrible times where I think, ""well, if it wasn't for him abusing me, he was great"" which is so fucking stupid, I don't know how I can think something so awful.

domesticviolence,"I need a little advice. I live with my grandma and little brother, my grans now 70 years old and is still working and struggling I do my share and put in money when we need it. About 4/5 years ago we kicked my older sister out the house because she was abusing my gran and little brother, I would get in between and hold my sister down so my gran/brother doesnt get hurt, My little brother has disabilities and is ADHD, during the time that my sister was gone she had stayed with her bf who lived with his parent at the age 47 (I know right) his parents then had to move houses just to get rid of them, so now they staying here. they have a baby boy now and use him as leverage, they make us feel guilty for wanting to get rid of them because of the emotional and physical abuse we receive from them. We have tried to kick them out many times but they continue to refuse, they've been staying with us for about 6 months now but haven't even put in a single cent in to help out, they eat all our food and take whatever they can for granted. Everyday there is an argument or a fist fight. I'm tired of this lifestyle and so is my gran and little brother. 
We have called the cops but they just come talk to her and go, she even shuts them down. Just yesterday I got a black eye because my sister was unhappy. When we eat at home we don't eat a lot but my sister still has the nerve to complain, we don't have a lot but she still takes from us because she's not happy till she gets the better half of things. Life's really hard and she makes things worse for all of us, we don't wanna call child line because they could just take my nephew away. We get threats from her saying she's going to get people to come attack us if we out on the street like for e.g.. walking to the shop's. In all honesty I'm tired of this and will do anything to get them out of our life for good. What can I do?

domesticviolence,"There would be a need for awareness from domestic violence support groups or women‚Äôs shelters or counselors, some one some way. But first it needs to be established and then taught to law enforcement or other mandated like reporters for when the abuser is around. 

I couldn‚Äôt call the cops myself, but I was able to contact the interpersonal violence risk manager from my university and she called the cops for me. She encouraged me to tell the cop the truth of what was going on. I was scared for my life. I wanted the cop to come but I was scared how he would react to that. When he found out that law enforcement was coming, he lost it. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but he was no longer him. I couldn‚Äôt talk him down. My natural instinct was to diffuse the situation. To make him feel better as I have been trained all these years to do. But this time was different and it terrified me. When the cop came, he talked to him first. He resumed to his natural charismatic state and was able to be calm enough to down play what was happening. The cop bought it. I was too scared to tell him that I was scared. I was scared what he would do to me or our kids once this was all over. I wouldn‚Äôt be protected forever. So I said nothing that would be protect me then. I didn‚Äôt want to be the bad guy. 

Looking back, I wish there was a code word that I could have used that the cop would have known that I was too afraid to speak. That would have taken some of the blame off of me. 

But it didn‚Äôt happen that way. 

It just built his confidence up. He gotten away with how he treated me, so he treated me worse. He‚Äôd rape me. And when I would talk to him about it later he said the way I said no was too cutesy to mean no. 

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. My therapist helped me come up with a plan and stick to it. So I packed what I could in the car and withdrew my kids out of school just to get away from him. 

I suffered severe depression, anxiety and ptsd from the years of his abuse. It was scary how bad my mental health got after I left.

domesticviolence,"I tried posting in r/relationships but the mods told me its serious and that the post would be better suited here. I think I'm most unsettled by how unemotional he was when he said it. just deadpan, not angry or anything really unsettling.

This didn't just happen but very recently. I should note that he is a very placid person, I've known him for 10 years (dated for 4) and in that time I think I've heard him raise his voice maybe only twice and only once towards me. He is not violent, and I don't know whether I should even take his threat seriously as I am unsure if he would hurt a fly. But what he said and how he said it did unsettle me greatly.

We were arguing about something probably insignificant but it escalated (maybe due to being stuck in the house all the time) and he made some comments I didn't like. Just things about me lacking drive to improve myself or something. So I slapped him. It was a very hard slap and he seemed taken aback by it a bit and I probably shouldn't have done that. But then he said something like ""Oh theres there she is"" (I can't remember exactly) implying I have a temper and this angered me so I (Again yes I know I shouldn't have) Went to punch him in the face with a closed fist. He caught my hand before I made contact with him and said to me ""you will never hit me again"" with a deadpan expression he then squeezed my fist hard and said ""or I will bury you in he woods"".

He then just stared at me for a few seconds before letting go of me and going upstairs to meditate and calm down. He didn't raise his voice, he didn't get up in my face it was all calm and just so unsettling. If he had been loud an aggressive I think that would have been more out of character but less unsettling as that a normal reaction, this was just scary as it almost made it seem like maybe he meant it, there was no emotion behind the words.

I have spoken to him since and we have not brought it up, his face is still bruised but he won't let me touch it or sooth it.

should I take this seriously?

domesticviolence,"I don't even know how to put this into words. It's long.  
I am a 32f who married a foreigner 9 years ago and live in his country of nationality. Last May the relationship came to an end with him alleging domestic abuse, saying that I assaulted him one night when I was very depressed and drunk, having me arrested, pursued an assault charge against me, said I threatened to kill my children, used this to have me kicked out of my home and the lives of my 2 young children. I had nowhere to go and moved to a different city where my mother had a friend with a spare room.   
In the meanwhile, my ex-husband didn't let me see my children then enforced rules on how I can see them and I took the matter to court. Social services became involved and he told them all sorts of lies about me saying that I withheld food from my eldest child to punish her, or threw her dinner away then gave her unhealthy food to eat, neglected her and made her look after her younger brother etc.  He also told me to leave the country and leave my children.   


The way he was so vindictively doing things made me suspect something. 2 weeks before the incident where he says I assaulted him, I was very depressed and suicidal. I told him I want to die and asked him for his prescription medication to overdose on. He gave them to me and left me to it. I took the pills and told him I was going to sit in the car to die. He just let me. When I woke the next morning, scared after realising I hadn't died, I went back to the house and asked him to call and ambulance. He hesitated. He did call for one in the end but didn't bother to come to the hospital to see me until many hours later. I have had depression since I was a teenager.   


I started suspecting that I had been a victim of domestic abuse for years. I called a helpline and told them my story. I was told that I have highlighted coercive control, gaslighting and one incident of rape. I then had to begin the painful process of believing that I had been abused and that my ex-husband seems to have set a trap for me to get me out of his life and that I stupidly fell into that trap. He had previously threatened to revoke my visa and have me leave the country without my children. In the months before the incident, when I expressed to him that I don't think our marriage is working, he told me once again that I could leave the country.  Seems like he's made good on his threats as I am fighting to remain in the country now. He even filed for a  divorce on my birthday. I went to the police to report the domestic abuse but I had terrible anxiety after that and had to retract my report for the sake of my mental health.  


He actively pursued assault charges against me and I tried to fight them. But I had no defence as I was intoxicated. The law frowns upon that. It didn't matter what he did before, all that mattered was that one incident. He also asked for a restraining order if I get convicted. I did get convicted, and he was granted a restraining order aginst me. He won't speak to me about our children, he won't involve me in decisions about them. Luckily I had the support of a DV organisation who helped me source a family lawyer and immigration lawyer. 

Needless to say, this has hit my mental health hard. It's been a struggle to accept that I gave many years of my life and sacrificed a lot only to have it all taken from me overnight. I've lost my children.   


This brings me to my current situation. I am living with a much older man. It started innocently enough with him letting me lodge in his spare room and providing me with emotional and mental support. As I could not pay any rent, I offered to cook and clean in return. The relationship became sexual and feelings became involved. But he would never 'put a status on it'. I have been referred to as his friend, lodger, flatmate, girlfriend. He said he doesn't like to label relationships, despite having had numerous girlfriends in the past. He is physically gentle and never aggressive. Verbally though, he has put me down about my choice of clothes (uncool), told me that anger is not a natural emotion that I am entitled to feel, that my being sad affects him because I'm sharing the space with him and my gloominess brings him down, that it is selfish of me to be angry or sad around him. He has told me that if I'm going to be gloomy then go do it in my own space. I thought I could go do it in my room, but even then the room is used as his office and exercise room too. So I don't actually have my own space.   


On Sundays I tend to be upset all day because I speak to my children on the computer in the morning and it hurts me when my children are allowed to be distracted during the call and I have to stare at an empty screen sometimes. Last Sunday after the call, I asked my flatmate if he'd like to go for a walk later. He said maybe. I went to my room, shut the blinds and door and lay in bed for a while. He asked if I was unwell or down. I told him I was down. He asked about the walk and I said no initially then thought it would be better for me to get out so we did go for a walk. It was uncomfortable. Later that day he said something about that, that I went to the room and was laying in the dark and it would be better if I didn't feel down at all. That by now I should have built a mechanism to shield myself from being upset by the calls with my children.  
A few days before that he was behaving unempathetically while we were out. Throwing food for birds near us even though I had just said that I'm scared of birds. Asking me if I was going to take a homelss guy home when I saw one and commented on the poor man. And when I told him that I find myself wanting some of my belongings from my ex-husband that I've had since I was a child or teenager, he told me those are just things. I said that those things are mine and have memories for me. He argued that the memories are in my mind and that should be enough and that things like books can be replaced. He said that objects are just objects, yet when I asked him how he would feel if I were to get rid of some of his seemingly unimportant objects (and there are lots) he said that would be unacceptable as that would be me taking control of his posessions. He also reinterated his possession of the space that I am living in by asking me, where am I going to put those things if I manage to get them from my ex.  


He treats me with disrespect a lot of the time. Like I'm his servant. He barely responds when I say something that he doesn't find interesting because he says why should he pretend to be interested? He is dismissive of me when I talk to him while he's doing something, yet he constantly talks to me when I am watching videos or trying to read. Yet he looks after me too. When I am too fatigued or upset to buy food and cook, he does it. He has taken me to the doctor when I have been very depressed.  


I spoke to my DV support worker. I told her it feels unhealthy for me to have to suppress my feelings and be told they are inappropriate. I told her I feel like I don't have my space. I asked her if it's abusive and she said yes. It is controlling and manipulative. That he gets a lot out of me being here: companionship, housework and cooking, sex....  
I told her that it feels wrong to say that someone who put a roof over my head and fed me when I couldn't afford anything for myself is abusing me. She said that gratitude does not excuse controlling behavior and that the power dynamics in this relationship have been skewed from the beginning making it easy for me to be abused. She told me she can help me get out of here and into a refuge or a room somewhere if I am homeless due to domestic abuse.

domesticviolence,"I've never used reddit before so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. I need an outsider view of a current situation I am in. I started seeing this person 2 months ago. From the beginning they were very charming but I quickly understood they were quite controlling/dominant. At first it was sort of attractive but things started to catch my attention. They were pretty demanding of sexual favors from the beginning but it almost started to feel like i didn't have an option just because the begging wouldn't stop and they would make me feel guilty.  One time they started to choke me when I declined and I was kind of blind sided by it. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a sexual thing that turned awkward or it was meant to be intimidating so I just shrugged it off. Well this continued. I am often choked sometimes out of the blue. I wouldn't say I feel like  a victim of abuse but I know I don't like what is happening. They often say things to suggest I have to prove my self worth to be associated with this person as if  they are of a higher power than me. They will not define the relationship or tell me if they are still talking to other people yet expect me to be only loyal to them. They  often get calls from somebody they claim to be a mentor for but will not explain what they are mentoring for, nor do i know the persons name/gender. If i ever bring up things that don't sit right with me I end up saying sorry somehow. They often make comments about being a pimp but play it off in a joking manner. One thing that really confused me is how they told me they don't ever want me to be around their friends and they never want to be around mine.  I just want to know if I am the one being crazy or if my feelings are valid because I feel I have been driven into psychosis. Is this emotional abuse or am I overthinking?

domesticviolence,"My mom and step brothers are mentally/physically abused on a daily basis by her husband. He beats her, hits her with objects and shouts at his kids every time they see him (over anything. Literally, anything). I've convinced my mom to audio record these incidents and send them to me by email. She doesn't want to seek help. He has brainwashed her to believe that he is all powerful and can do whatever he wants to whoever he wants. He checks her phone on an almost daily basis. Restricts her communication to almost every part of her family. I have voice recordings from her of him shouting and cursing around and at the kids too. He calls her all the possible combinations of curse words. She has been to a lawyer and has been told that she will be safe, her kids will be safe and no harm will come to any of them if she decides to take action. But she's scared and doesn't want to do that. She's afraid of losing her kids because men in that country get custody of the children in almost any situation. She doesn't want to lose them and she's scared that she might. I'm afraid for her safety and for my step brothers futures. I love all of them to death and I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do. Do any of you know what can be done in this situation?

In short:
Mother and 2 children are being physically and mentally abused by her husband. She's afraid to seek help because he's threatened her countless times and because she feels unsafe to do so.

domesticviolence,"I love both of my parents. I always have. My father has always been more difficult to get along with so I'm closer to my mother but I still really love my father because he's always been a good father to me. 

My parents were together 6 years before they had me and they were never actually married but they've always lived together on my family's (mom's side) land. My entire life my mom has struggled with depression. I know because I've always seen it and she doesn't try to hide it other than never saying she's depressed but I was always the one she cried to for as long as I can remember. I've never actually thought my parents had a really happy relationship and I thought they would probably eventually separate but they never have. My parents work together, they are both scenic artists and have a name for their two man group and everything. When they don't work on movies they do work in people's houses. I've known my entire life my dad was hell to work with because that was what my mom usually cried to me about when I was a kid but apparently as he's gotten older he's gotten worse (I'm honestly not sure if I believe that though.) 

5 years ago my grandfather (mother's father) died from dementia. It was slow and we took care of him till the end feeding him, giving him his medicine, and changing his diapers. He couldn't be out in an assisted living facility because his dementia made him see everyone as monsters and think he was trapped so he would try to escape and fight back at people. It was really hard on my mom. That's when her depression started getting worse understandably. It's also when my father had a heart attack and had to get heart surgery. I believe that messed with him mentally as well but he doesn't talk about stuff like that so it's hard to know. It was a really stressful time. I didn't graduate highschool because of how many days I missed taking care of my grandfather and my mom blamed herself for that. My dad was disappointed and his usual judgmental self about it but he didn't really say much to me other than he won't take care of me. If he said anything else about me it wasn't to my face. The next year is also when I moved out because I genuinely wanted to have some space from my parents. I was battling my own demons from not graduating and a bunch of other things and I didn't feel like I should be there anymore. One day my mom was crying and hugged me and actually begged me not to leave her. I reassured her I was only going to be 20 min away and still going to be by almost every day and she got silent. I probably could have handled it better but I've never actually known how to comfort my mom other then say nice words and reassure her. After I left I guess their relationship took a turn for the worse slowly. Because her father died her depression was bad and she was loosing purpose and would sleep a lot. My dad got tired of it after a while and started calling her useless and telling her she doesn't do anything. Her whole life she's had a serious inferiority complex so I know that obviously did not help her. She went deeper into depression but still worked with my dad and what not on jobs. At some point she started having to ask my dad for money to pay the bills. Apparently up until then my mom had always payed the bills even if it meant taking all of her retirement and any money she was trying to save for me as well. My dad payed some I think or payed for something at least. But work has been slow these past 5 years so she's had to rely on him more. He wanted to stop working and ""retired"" but because they need money he still works with her. So with his retirement check supplementing them he's the main one paying for stuff now. It makes him really angry and he always fusses at her over money constantly. Last year I actually worked with them on a movie and I got to finally see first hand what my father was like to work with and it honestly made me hope my mother leaves him. I never in a million years thought I would think that but he was so rude and yelled constantly. He was so hard to work with even to other people (they just talked to my mom instead) and he would call my mother stupid all the time. He pointed some towards me but it was mostly just at my mom. After that I think it's just gotten worse and worse. My dad doesn't want to work anymore and hates that he has to to help support them. I can't imagine my father is happy either though so I honestly think both my parents are depressed and need help but neither trust therapists. 

My father's life consists of sitting at home with their dog smoking pot and watching TV. He's a Vietnam vet and has PTSD he's never been treated for so he smokes to help deal with it. You would think it would make him a bit happier and easier to be around but it doesn't for my mom atleast. She's depressed because he shows no love towards her at all anymore and tells her how she won't amount to anything and is useless and I think he's told her or implied to her that she's ugly and that's why he won't touch her. My dad probably has some sort of depression but he doesn't talk to anyone about his feeling so I wouldn't know for sure. They only have one car so he can't go anywhere unless my mom drives him. He gets upset when she's at my grandmaws house for too long (days) and accuses her of neglecting him. If my dad didn't live there though he would have nowhere to live. And for some reason even though my dad is so hard for everyone to work with he's the one people hire for work and my mom has trouble getting people to talk to her even though she's the boss and takes care of everything and is just as talented as him. So she probably feels like she couldn't survive without him and I'll be honest it would be really hard for her. The only thing my parents have ever done is art. And my dad would be homeless without my mom and her land. My mom's started breaking down though from the slightest things because she thinks she's a useless good for nothing. I don't know everything my father says to her because I don't live with them anymore but I atleast know the things I've said in this post. She's so depressed and stressed. I'm not sure what to do for her. I'm pregnant and was hoping that maybe they both might have some meaning brought back to their life from a grandchild but at the same time I won't let them make her stressed and depressed at a young age like I was. I want to help them both as much as I can but I have no idea how. I have a therapist I can possibly ask for advice but other than that that's it. My boyfriend's at a loss too because he's never really had experience with stuff like this until he met me but we both agree that something has to happen. I have 4 half siblings (all same dad) but they all have their own life and families and problems so I'm not sure how they could help. But I really want to help my mom. It's not healthy to feel like this I should know because I have before but we're very different in terms of what helps up cope and I'm also not even fully finished fighting my own demons so I don't have all the answers just yet. Any advice would greatly be appreciated and if anyone could tell me if this does indeed sound like verbal abuse that would be helpful too because I never know if I'm jumping to conclusions or not.",I'm(23f) really positive my mom(56f) is being verbally abused by my father(70m) and I'm honestly not sure what to do or who to ask for advice.,ThrowRApoiuy,2020-04-29 02:24:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ga11h1/im23f_really_positive_my_mom56f_is_being_verbally/,0,1.0,2,26,1416
domesticviolence,"As most of you know the story that has been going on with me and the current situation that I am living in: with my rather violent abusive controlling and psycho adoptive mother.

Tonight's incident was the straw that broke the camel's back literally.

What happened was she was going on about the $750 stimulus that most of us Australians get because of this COVID-19 situation. And then she started abusing the shit out of me for it.. I then looked her dead in the eyes and said something along the lines ""Don't be angry at me because you got nothing, be angry at the system that made up the rules on who gets it"". Because that was the angle I thought she was taking: wrong it pissed her off something fierce .. she was expecting to get some of it.

Anyway it turned into an all-out fight (no physical contact), she started slamming cupboard doors and the like in order to try and intimidate or scare me as she's done in the past .. Then a bit more verbal abuse followed up after that with me retreating to the computer room to try and get away from her ..

To be honest I am literally shaking in anger, almost in tears to think this lady thinks she can be so abusive towards me and still expect for things to be done around the house, for things such as groceries and bills to be paid, my mentality is this, as you know: treat me like shit and you get nothing in return.

I have been holding back on this for quite some time, but I am strongly considering writing out an email to her, not being rude or abusive in it, but explaining my point of view, and then telling her a few home truths of my own, why was she not aggressive or abusive towards me for the first 5 years of my life whilst the adoption agency people came to check on me, why after 5 years did she then decide to start with what she did, when she could have been the better person and brought me up properly instead of what she did. 

I swear if she lays a hand on me one more time, I will leave, find legal representation and bring all that I have to bear against this woman, for I believe that she should be brought to justice like my biological mother was all those years ago ..",Tonight has been the straw that broke the camel's back!,AuSSiETiG3R,2020-04-28 09:52:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g9kf04/tonight_has_been_the_straw_that_broke_the_camels/,6,1.0,15,10,411

This is the second bad screaming incident that we have had, and in the earlier incident I also left the situation quietly and didn‚Äôt communicate for a few hours.

May 20, 2015. My 28th birthday.¬†¬†

May 20, 2015. My freedom date.¬†

When I was living in abuse I constantly felt like I was the ball in an underwater pinball machine. Being bounced around between my abusers moods, while trying to hide what was happening. Always unable to breathe. Drowning.¬†

When in that space, moments of clarity when we are able to finally see the internal and external bruises and scars, are rare, and a gift. One of my moments occurred on May, 20 2015. My freedom date. My 28th birthday.¬†

Five days before my abuser escalated again when he hit me in front of our friends in a public place. On May 15, 2015 we went to celebrate a friend's birthday, and per usual, my abuser had too much to drink. The owners, good friends of ours, told me that I needed to get my husband home before they had to kick him out. I knew this wouldn‚Äôt go over well, but I also knew that I had to do something before anything worse happened. I thanked them for telling me and let them know I would take care of it.¬†

I went outside to where my husband was hanging out with our friends. I put on a smile, and tried to approach him with the *‚Äúeverything is ok, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, it's just time to go‚Äù* vibe. I said, ‚Äúhey baby, let's go home and see Quinn (our dog).‚Äù He said something sweet about Quinn and told me how much he loved me and our little family. I told him I was ready to go home and wanted him to come with me. He switched, said he wasn‚Äôt ready to leave, with his slurred speech and rocking body. He was wasted. I realized then that my approach was not working and I had to be more direct. I told him we had been asked to leave because he had had too much to drink and had made a scene. Next thing I knew, I felt his palm on my face, he slapped me hard. In public. In front of our friends. My first reaction was to defend him. I begged my guy friends not to react, and I walked away. A few guys took him aside and a few of my girlfriends came after me. I remember the embarrassment I felt. Gut wrenching, nauseating embarrassment. The cat was out of the bag. I couldn‚Äôt hide what was happening anymore. I had to face it. I saw the abuse through my friends eyes. They asked me what I wanted to do, how they could help. I told them I wanted to go home, and ride out the night until he passed out. He and I would talk about what happened in the morning after he sobered up. A few friends came home with us to ensure my safety. We proceeded through the night as if nothing had happened.

I woke up early the next day, sick to my stomach with embarrassment, shame, fear, and grief. All of those emotions piled into one moment make it hard to know what to do. What I wanted was not in my control. I wanted my husband to stop hitting me so I didn‚Äôt have to leave him.¬†

I got out of bed and went and laid on the couch. It was early and this was unlike me for a Saturday morning. He woke up and came into the living room and asked me what I was doing. Why was I sleeping on the couch? I calmly told him that it was because I was hurt by what he had done the night before. Per usual, he claimed he didn‚Äôt remember. I told him the story of what had happened. The cat was out of the bag. People now knew and saw with their own eyes, the dark side of our marriage. He was mortified. He cried. He begged me not to leave. He said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. He swore he would find help. Start therapy. Quit drinking. And when I reminded him that he had said the same thing many times before, he said that this time it was different. He didn‚Äôt want to lose me. He couldn‚Äôt lose me.¬†

All I remember about that conversation was the heartache I felt. I no longer felt lost. I no longer felt shame, or fear. While we had had hundreds of conversations about this subject. He was different this time. Things had come to a head and we were at a fork in the road. I truly felt he was going to take this seriously now. I was still eager to see if he followed through, but I did have  a tinge of hope.¬†¬†

We spent the day together, he let me cry when I needed to. If I felt we needed to talk more, he would listen and engage. He called all of our friends and apologized, thanked them for standing up for me and told them he was going to get help. We both knew we were facing an uphill battle to heal ourselves and our marriage. I was of course going to embark on this journey of repair with him. He was my husband, I loved him, and I promised to love him in sickness and in health, and he was sick.¬†

My birthday was on Wednesday that week, and my girlfriends and I made plans to go to a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class on Tuesday night to kick off the birthday festivities. When I got home the house was empty, it was almost 9:00pm and that was very unusual for a work night. I called and texted my husband a few times with no luck. I was scared and I remember going back and forth between thinking ‚ÄúFUCK, here we go again,‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt jump to conclusions, don‚Äôt assume the worst. He promised. It will be ok.‚Äù¬†

I don‚Äôt recall the details of what happened that night. I remember hearing the door open and being relieved, and then the fear when I realized he was drunk and on a tirade. I remember the fighting. The yelling. Me trying to leave. Him not letting me. I remember giving up and trying to go to sleep so that he might too. I remember him coming into the room and forcing me out of bed. I remember going outside to smoke a cigarette. I remember looking inside at him and seeing him yell at me through the glass. Then I remember the loud crash, glass flying in my face, and looking up to see his fist.¬†

This is how fucked up abuse is. I don‚Äôt know exactly when, but somewhere along the road of abuse I learned that keeping him happy and healthy, kept me happy, healthy and safe. When he punched me through the window I didn‚Äôt run. I didn‚Äôt leave. I immediately asked him if he was ok, sat him down on the couch, and while he cried, began taking the glass out of his hand and arm, and bandaged his wounds.¬†

After I ‚Äúcared‚Äù for him, he calmed down and finally passed out.¬†

The next day, when I woke up on my birthday, I realized for the first time I wished I hadn‚Äôt. It was my birthday and I wanted to die. I had zero hope for my marriage. I had zero hope for the future. I had no idea what to do.

I wandered around the house, numb and anxious.¬†

I am not sure exactly what happened next, I just remember my moment of clarity.¬†

I realized‚Ä¶.

Abuse is NOT a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a CHOICE. A choice that is made every time he hurts me with his words or hands, and it is a choice every time he doesn‚Äôt get help.¬†

He was escalating. Things were getting worse. It had only been FIVE days since the last act of violence. FIVE fucking days! I was in danger.¬†

It was MY BIRTHDAY! And the person that should be celebrating my life with me, was the one threatening it.

Reluctantly, I saw what William Earnest Henley wrote in his poem Invictus, ‚ÄúI am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt like the options I had, but I did have options, and I had to get out.¬†¬†

When he woke up, I told him I was leaving for work, and I wasn‚Äôt going to be home that night. I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. He needed help and it was his shit to figure out.¬†

I asked him, for my birthday, to please not fight for me, or beg me to stay.¬†

For my birthday, please just let me leave.¬†

May 20, my birthday in more ways than one.

domesticviolence,"Hi Reddit.  (On mobile and I barely slept, sorry for the format and grammar)

Last night I had to call the cops on my husband because he chocked me out, he did it by grabbing me from behind and putting me on a choke hold, I was fighting to make him stop and I was scared that I was going to die. He left the apartment and I called 911.

The police arrived about 20 mins later, took my statement took all of his guns, took a picture of my neck and they left. 

I got a text from him saying that he wants a divorce and that he can't be in a relationship with someone who baits him into fighting.

He did come back grab a backpack fill of stuff and left.  I had put a chair on the front door but he was able to open the door.

My friend heard everything because we were on discord playing Diablo III together and my husband broke my monitor. 

At 3 am I called the policeman because the paper work said that he strangulated me and that's a felony charge so I was scared that he will go to jail for a long time, the policeman said that he has changed the paperwork to say that he put hands on my neck.

My question is what's going to happen next?  I am in Los Angeles. 

My dad was abusive but my mom never called the cops so I have never dealt with the domestic court system. 

I am scared and I don't know what to do next.

domesticviolence,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time using Reddit. I'm not sure if this will help in any way but I don't know what else to do. Just looking for anyone who can relate. Since I've been ten years old, I have been experiencing violence from my father. Includes being slapped and punched in the face, having my head held down in pillows so I can't breathe, being choked till I suffocate, having my head slammed against a wall repeatedly, having plates of food and trash cans emptied over my head, being kicked in the stomach, having clothes ripped off me, etc. I have been legitimately scared I would be killed at least twice or thrice. I am now 20 years old and moved out of home, and am in university. However everything I bottled up as a child and as a teenager seems to be affecting me now. Am having frequent panic attacks, nausea, chest pain, nightmares, and overall rage, anger, fear, and depression over my past issues with my father.  Have confided in my mother who has also been subjected to violence from father but she tells me I am ""sensitive, over reacting, and too young to understand why my father did what he did."" This makes me even more upset because I feel like my feelings are being brushed away. I do love my father, he funds my education, and apart from his violent outbursts is the perfect dad. I feel guilty for holding a grudge against him. I feel it is my fault for being unable to move on. I feel it was a trivial matter but I am making a big deal out of it. But on the other hand am being severely affected to the point where I feel suicidal, am too depressed to get out of bed, cannot function. I am also starting to want to be beaten, and am wanting to harm myself because it has started feeling good. Am i overreacting? Am i creating this pain for myself? Want to forgive and forget, but am being held back.

domesticviolence,"I was assaulted in my sleep by my room mate. He hit me to wake me up before jumping on top of me and choking me and telling me he was going to throw me in a well. This person is allowed to carry a gun.

The reason he did this is because the night before, he and 6 guests woke me up at 1 am and I told them to quiet down.

I kicked him off me after my survival instincts kicked in, and the assaulted lasted less than two minutes; but I was asleep when it began. This person also stole the lock off of my door when he was moving out the next week.


The person who attacked me went to the police right after and filed a false police report claiming that i attacked him after a long verbal argument. Saying he doesn't wish to prosecute. He also claims to have a witness, even though MY witness was the only other person at the house at the time of the assault. In his report, he claimed that I would come forward eventually with lies and a false witness.


The cops pretty much told me to get over it. They also shamed me for waiting 2 months to come forward. The detective told me at this point if  I were to stir it up it would basically be my word against his, pointlessly expensive, and its possible that both of us would go to jail for assault just to prove I got attacked.

domesticviolence,"I met him when I was around 37. Several of my friends had already gotten married. My African mother who hadn‚Äôt so much had pressured me to get married all of my adult years had started hinting at marriage. The biological clock had started to tick, although I can‚Äôt say I heard the ticktock was from within. I had always known I wasn‚Äôt going to marry at a young age. My parents divorced when I was little, and I think I made a mental note to not get married until I was sure about whom I was getting married. But the clock ticked nonetheless because even though women are having children later in life or choosing to not have any these days, we are still bombarded with images of what ‚Äúcompletes‚Äù a woman. Date successfully. Get the engagement ring. Have a beautiful wedding, followed by babies. The unspoken rule of thumb is to get to it.

It was surreal how I missed the signs in that situation (it would be almost too generous to call it a relationship) because of this fear of missing out. Looking back the signs were there (they always are). Was it on the first date, when I mentioned the importance of intuition during our conversation and he outright dismissed it (and so had I, as it turned out) or was it when we were on the second date, and a political topic came up and he couldn‚Äôt see an alternate point of view. I was perplexed that I had listened to his perspective, and he didn‚Äôt even seem capable of hearing mine. That was a glimpse of what was to come. But I stayed, thinking we could work things out. Plus, it was time to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt help that when I slowly realized I was caught up in an unhealthy, toxic, dysfunctional ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, I lacked the willpower to pull away. He would cross boundaries, we would fight, I‚Äôd pull away, he would apologize, then things would be back to ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù until the next episode ‚Äì rinse and repeat. We got engaged, even made plans to start a family. But the temper tantrums and emotional volatility made me question what kind of father he would be to our children, and what type of mother I would be seeing these character traits and still moving forward with bringing innocent children - whether biologically conceived or adopted -  into that scenario. I believe this realization and the affirmations I had committed to saying and writing daily strengthened my resolve to see things for what they were and to walk away and not look back. 

It was a tough period. It seemed everything that could go wrong did. I had just being let go from a job around that time (something he couldn‚Äôt wait to throw in my face shortly after). I moved out and the space this created between us gave me the chance to at least begin the healing process. Of course, he tried to convince me to come back. I was tempted, but I was also done with that cycle. Frankly, going back would have been insanity especially since he simply refused, or was unable to comprehend there was a problem. 

What followed was a lot of soul searching and figuring out how I got sucked into that circus in the first place. I had to critically assess myself, my previous relationships, and the caliber of people I allowed into my life. The type of behavior I condoned. Whew, it was a resentment-inducing, and at times, isolating process. Holding myself accountable, gently reconnecting with my intuition, and allowing it to guide me again, and standing up for my well-being helped get me through it. 

I learned some important lessons along the way: that I ultimately was looking for validation in others and subconsciously accepted subpar treatment from them in exchange for some kind of superficial ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù that I believed at the time was authentic. I doubt I was the best quality of friend either since I was unwittingly hoping to get from others what I was unwilling (or unable) to give to myself because I subconsciously believed I wasn‚Äôt worthy. It was quite the revelation. I am more careful these days of whom I let into my life. I have a much better idea of what I won‚Äôt tolerate. There have been some dating missteps but I recognize and process them more quickly now.

It feels good to have closed that chapter of my life, but I won‚Äôt lose the lesson. And it‚Äôs this: as we navigate this journey of life, the only person we truly live with is ourselves and we must intrinsically love and treasure ourselves. It‚Äôs transformative healing that‚Äôs not always easy, or clear, but it‚Äôs magical if we allow and trust the process and keep putting one step in front of the other. It takes ongoing courage to hear, listen to, and heed the voice within humans don‚Äôt live life in a vacuum. Societal beliefs, mores, trends, values, affect how we show up in the world. 

Knowing this, we must always direct the extent to which they do, and it should never be to our detriment because that is a travesty to the gift of life we are given.",Light at the end of the tunnel,lightatendoftunnel20,2020-04-25 07:53:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g7ps9s/light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel/,2,0.81,3,7,878

domesticviolence,"I don‚Äôt mean that he‚Äôs more violence than others. I‚Äôve been here before and read your posts. A lot of you have day-to-day lives way harder than mine, and my heart breaks for you too every day.

But while my abuser isn‚Äôt violent all the time, he certainly can be, and always shows me this great capacity of his whenever I try to live or disagree with him.

But if I‚Äôm ‚Äúa good girl‚Äù I get an ALMOST normal life. He even buys me presents sometimes, although I‚Äôm NEVER allowed to make a purchase on my own or even ask for anything. I get what I get and I pretend to be happy, because being sad is against the rules. 

I‚Äôm not his first victim. He told me he was abused by two women before me, but then I found out everything he said they did to him was really the other way around. I know what they went through, but they got out and I can‚Äôt.

You see, he learned from his past mistakes. Not the right mistakes, of course, but he learned how to plan ahead so the next victim wouldn‚Äôt get away.

I‚Äôve been here before. You all have treated me with such kindness and brilliant advice. Unfortunately for me, he saw each of my moves before they happened. The other girls likely tried everything before me and now he seems almost clairvoyant, otherworldly.

He was a lot more violent in the beginning. He was setting everything up, training me, so that I would become what I am today: submissive and a GREAT actor. 

I didn‚Äôt understand what he was doing at first. I was just trying to do anything to get him to stop hurting me, to trust me, to love me. 

He made me send mean messages to all my friends and family I knew before him. He would make up reasons why none of them were worthy, and I‚Äôd have to convincingly burn every bridge off this sad secluded island. No one cares about me anymore. 

When we meet new friends, he gets them alone and tells them we‚Äôve had issues in the past with my cheating (that never happened), but he was willing to look past it and now we have this wonderful relationship. They see him as a saint and know I‚Äôm not to be trusted, turning them into unwitting spies. If they ever see me somewhere I‚Äôm not supposed to be or talking to someone they don‚Äôt know, they tell him. They‚Äôre just looking out after all.

He made me give up my phone and take one of his so he can monitor all my calls. He checks every number he doesn‚Äôt recognize, he reads all my texts and monitors my social media. He shuts off my phone if he thinks I‚Äôm getting ready to leave. He is my only portal to the outside world.

He made me give him my bank account passwords, my credit cards, even my drivers license, SS card and birth certificate. He wouldn‚Äôt let me renew my drivers license and instead got a non drivers ID, so now I can‚Äôt even drive legally. On paper, he owns me. 

He moved me against my will to his small rural hometown. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he would want to move here, but then I realized everyone here is either friend or family to him. The loyalty of this town is to him, and there are no resources here to help anyone. The nearest city with a single women‚Äôs shelter is an hour away. I‚Äôm in his world that only he can control.

He makes me work a job, a privilege I was ecstatic about. His best friend is my boss, his other friends are my coworkers. More spies. They don‚Äôt know he abuses me and still treat me nicer than he does, so it‚Äôs not all bad, but I still have to give him all my money and do all the housework. He keeps me busy all the time. 

I am thankful that he can at least control his violence. I can avoid being hurt if I follow the rules, but he will release it with all his fury if I break a rule. He has threatened to kill me many times, mostly when I fight back and try to get away. He had tried to choke and drown me before, so now when he says he will kill me I stop everything and do whatever he says. He keeps me in my place.

I don‚Äôt really know the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to get out of this one. None of the great advice I‚Äôve gotten from anyone seems to apply to me. I can‚Äôt call police because he said he would kill me and I know that‚Äôs not an empty threat. He has said many times that our relationship will ultimately end murder-suicide style. He‚Äôs not afraid to die, and often wishes for death. I have to keep him away from those thoughts because if he decided to kill him self, he will likely take me with him.

I can‚Äôt call hotlines or services because he will know before I even get a chance to explain anything, not to mention the fact that I‚Äôm under constant surveillance and can‚Äôt even go anywhere private to talk. I did actually call the shelters in the bigger cities hours away once, but even they said they are often full and give preference to the individuals who are physically there, not someone who is 2 hours away. They said I could call every day until there‚Äôs an opening, but I only ever got the one chance.

I fear the advanced abuser. The one who knows exactly what his victim will try to do before they even think of it themselves. There are so many other little rules and contingencies that keep me in place but this post is too long already.

I just wanted to put this out there, maybe someone who is involved in DV support can see this and figure out a way to reach those of us who are nearly invisible and unreachable victims. Those of us who only get that one chance to reach out and then it‚Äôs over.

I‚Äôm working on a plan to use quarantine to my advantage to get out of this situation. I‚Äôve packed a bug out bag and have made a secret email and have been carefully working on some things. If this works I will try to post again, but for right now I know it‚Äôs risky and I‚Äôm not following the standard advice of involving professionals so if it doesn‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt want to inadvertently cause someone else to make the same mistake. 

I think when I‚Äôm out of this I will be able to better think of ideas to help people like me, and I think I would want to do that. I think hefty social programs are the only real  way to really help people as entrenched in a situation as I am, though. 

Free childcare, UBI, guaranteed and quick cell phone access (burner phones), universal healthcare, free college, advanced and accessible public transport. If even some of those things existed I would probably have been able to leave by now, but when you have no money and no access to the outside world, it‚Äôs hard to do things like get a ride away from your abuser, find a place to sleep for the night, get a new job, get an apartment, avoid starvation. I can‚Äôt even apply for government aid because I have no ID or SS card or birth certificate! It‚Äôs going to be a long road JUST to get my documentation back, and it‚Äôs not free. 

If you read through my story; thank you. If there is anyone who could use any of this info to help anyone else, please share. Only I can save myself at this point, but I want my tragedy to mean something. I want this to help someone else somehow. I want to get out and directly help others but if I don‚Äôt get out then all I have is this story, and maybe some day that will help someone.

My father since I have memory is a very explosive person, if I do something wrong like failing in some chore he will snap at me out of the blue. And in most extreme cases hit me. I know it's common in latina homes the use of sandals for example to educate. But when I was around 7 he used the belt with me and my brother, when I was 13 and I didn't do the homework he hit me until I peed my pants , when I was 16 he hit me with the phone .  When I started having depression and cut myself he hit me again but this time my brother got in the middle.
Now , at 23 he started screaming at my mother for the most stupid reasons , this pandemic is forcing me to stay in the house 24/7 and recent events has made him scream at us , get into fights , he has always been verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but seeing him scream at my mother bothers me. She did nothing wrong. And I'm scared , my brother always gets in the middle when he is about to hit me , but I don't want this anymore. I can't defend myself , I'm scared of my own father.

domesticviolence,"How many times does they say it takes someone to leave before they finally leave for the last time? I think its 7 and I've gotta be on number 7 or 8. Yeah its gotta be a lot by now counting the exact situations just will upset me. 

Either way long story short story. We met, turned into a thing, already there was drama but I ignored it and pushed it off as other people involved, then I moved in with them, paid all bills paid for really everything. Got verbally and emotionally abused and manipulated and mistreated all the time. She stole money from me, even got physical to the point of pushing me and shoving me into a wall once. I was cut off from my family and friends, had no money or resources for myself as a 18 y/o w no diploma just college creds lmao. 

But I struggled, stayed at a friends for like 3 weeks, then I moved an hour away with a roommate, few months later i had my own apartment. 

Depression, loneliness or homesickness got the best of me and I was so vulnerable. She knew it . I let her come over but every time I did she would want to stay the night then the whole next day, she would say she was about to leave and then somehow fall asleep and wake up during 5 o'clock traffic and wouldnt want to drive through that to saying oh no it's too late to go back and I dont want to drive in the dark. 

Of course if that was me I know I wouldnt want to drive in the dark, I get anxious and can barely see so why would I make someone else do it? Whatever anyways. Then when I would push the hint of when are you leaving what is your plans she would guilt trip me and whatnot. I started never wanting to bring it up. Somehow she just brought more of her shit inside and then we were stuck. 

Or I'm stuck. 

Now within the past month we have had two incidences involving police. She has gotten physical with me, my dog, has taken toilet paper out of the house, poured out dog food, taken laundry detergent, my face wash, food whatever right. Said the most hurtful things.  And I'm done. Emotionally, financially, I literally am a physical ball of manifested stress. 

But I let her back this last time because... well. I wanted to smoke but also she needed to get her shit and I told her she would need to bring dog food back. And honestly I'm scared of her. Maybe not scared so much of what she could do but scared of her thoughts, what she will say, if she tries to get seriously physical with me I dont want to catch a charge defending myself and my dogs. and I thought itd be safer for me to just stay civil. Handle the separation and kicking her out with grace or whatever so then she wont get obsessive and crazy. (She stalked her ex before ) 

But now she is back. She is causing me so much anxiety and I'll give it a couple days tops til something else happens. I cant involve my family anymore. They think this is over with and the thought of disappointing them or hurting them any further hurts. Plus I need this to be done on my own this time.

domesticviolence,"Everytime we get into a fight and I try to express to him how I feel about something he usually gives me the cold shoulder. Our arguments usually end up with him running into the office and pretending like I dont exist when I want to finish talking. He says I'm bringing up arguments from months ago..I feel like we never talk to resolve anything and it all comes out. Yes I have unplugged the computer before because I was angry and tired of being ignored all the time. He tells me to give him space we will talk later. It never happens. Yes I have called him a mommas boy before because he does not stand up to her and defend me. The family has said things I feel were hurtful but he is mad when I say that and says I'm just too sensitive. I tried distancing myself from his family and again he got angry he said the relationship was bullshit because of it. I told him he treats me like a dog and thinks hes superior to me. Hes called me a fucking bitcb and put his fist in my face. When I told him to get out he asked me ""oh are you scared of me"" like a taunt. I told him yes. The next day he says to me ""babe you know I'd never hurt you"". Do I though? He says I'm the one who treats him badly and hes going to set cameras around the house to video tape what kind of awful person I am to him. I'm sitting her going am I the abusive one? I told him at Easter time only him and his mom make the plans I'm never allowed to be in the plan making. He said I was being a fucking child because his mom excluded me. He says I'm just trying to keep him away from his family. I'm sorry I dont want them at my house. I know they dont like me and they want nothing to do with me. Now I feel bad for even putting my foot down. I ask him to stop swearing and screaming at me cause the neighbours will hear. He says he wouldn't have to swear at me if I listened to him.

domesticviolence,"Hey everyone!

I am 2 years, 2 months, and 3 days free of my abuser. It's been a long journey and still more to go, but I wanted to share a book I recently finished. Part of my recovery has led me to a newfound love of hiking and I started a book, last week, about the first female solo thru hiker of the Appalachian Trail. ""Grandma Gatewood's Walk"" by Ben Montgomery.  She's 67, alone, no special gear or training, but so clearly a survivor with the most amazing strength of will. 

Later in the book you find out that she was a victim of domestic abuse for many years. The read hit me hard, but in a great way. It reminded me that we're survivors tapping into incredible strength even while we struggle and fight for the most basic freedoms. It made me proud of myself and I wanted to share the book with you in case you need inspiration.

domesticviolence,"Idk what to do anymore I'm tired of him,his narcissistic attitude,his sociopathic behaviour,he is a monster and I want to get as far away from him as I can.My dad was always a real piece of shit but quite recently he's turned the bar to whole new level.

For some context,middle eastern ,m18,and I am trapped in Istanbul.This is not my country,my father being the psycho control freak he is took me and my mom away from our home town when I was born and we lived in shithole apartments in third world countries all my life.
I remember all the arguements we had when I was younger about how everyone else is emmigrating to a better life in the US or UK and remember crying to hard pleading to him to do it,and I remember him laughing and grinning at me,amused in a sick and twisted way.Almost like he was taking pleasure in it.That was six years ago,from then on I realised this man is a psychopath and he is going to torture me and my mom till the end of it all.

It all improved slightly in 2018 when he moved back home to the old country for work and left me and my mom alone for a few months at a time.I remember all the calm,happy days going out to the movies with my mom,seeing her face,knowing he isn't gonna hurt us for a while.Fast forward to 2019 and my IGCSE exams are coming up,I work hard and get straight As.

Well now as my high school was over I didn't know better and decided against continuing my A levels there.That was undoubtably the worst mistake of my life.Not knowing what this monster was planning to do with us.He came back,talking about moving us to Oman and other quite frankly ""terrible places"" to live,just so itll be cheaper for him.He kept saying we'll be closer to him and he can be with us more often.

This psychopath was planning my misery 

My mom and I refused to go and insisted on a somewhat ok place to move.Turkey,istanbul.Fairly good place,and the plan was he come to us, help us pack and move to Istanbul,and then he would go back home.

He came in july,2019.I had these amazing 4 little budgerigars and our plan was to bring them with us,I had rescued one of them and they were practically family.My mom promised she would move earth and heaven to bring em with us,and I believed her because she loved them as much as I did.

before the move dad brought his buddies over to paint the house without asking so that he could get his deposit check on the house,and thats only the half of it.

(P.s he hadn't payed the rent so he ended up not even getting it in the end)

Painting the house wasn't the end of it,he sold everything.All our furniture , everything,he even had his buddy to ""fix"" my bed,so he could sell it.He basically asked for 1000 dollars and let strangers come take everything they wanted from us,picking our house clean.Mom and I had never felt so uncomfortable.

At this point I had already kinda realised what this guy was doing and when he barged into my room at 7 in the morning demanding to ""take a look at my bed"" I refused,telling him to get out and he's not selling my bed and making me sleep on the floor for my last weeks here.Can you guess what he did?

This monster showed his true colours.

He grabbed my by the neck ,threw me on the floor,banging my head onto my luggage bags btw and proceded to choke me.Spitting on my face he said,""I'm gonna kill you you shit"".Mom heard the commotion and came to save me intime before he had done some permanent damage.

You would think after seeing her son abused like this,a mother would divorce this son of a bitch and protect her son.

So later dad went to ""take the birds to the airport to be flown to istanbul"" and in a couple weeks we followed suit, when we got off our flight we realised he hadn't planned to take an ordinary taxi to the hotel,and there wasn't gonna be any hotel.

He had found this illegal taxi business who was comprised of unlicenced assholes with beat up pieces of junk with no ac to take us.Just so he could save a couple bucks.

So we get to our temprorary place and even though hotels are quite cheap dad decides that it would be a good idea to do the same thing he did with the taxi for the place.He books us an illegal airbnb SHITHOLE that a bunch of scumbags were renting out with no furniture and burnt sheets.And his excuse was,""its holiday season all the hotels in istanbul were overbooked"".As soon as I start protesting this bullshit ,he goes complete apeshit at me and threatens me,when my mom steps in and threatens to divorce him and move away as we can easily go to our own country away from him ,he backs down realising that he doesn't have complete control over us ,yet.

He agrees to move out,giving the keys back to the scumbags and telling our illegal taxi guy (I'd like to clarify that these illegal scumbags and taxi guys aren't from turkey, they are scumbags from our home country so you can realise why I'm angry dad is doing this,its not a oh its a strange place strange faces type deal, its deliberate) to take us to the nearest (he makes sure to add cheapest) hotel.At this point mom and I are exhausted ,its been a 12 hour flight and we are just aching for some bedrest.We check in and what do ya know, turns out the rooms aren't overbooked after all,makes you think.

So after a week or two we find a place to move and pack out our stuff.A couple days pass and dad goes HEY I FOUND A JOB HERE.I CAN STAY HERE WITH YOU GUYS.He comes into my room and gives me the coldest grin,one that gave me goosebumps,it felt like staring into the eyes of the devil.

So now he's staying with us,after a year has almost passed, an unfurnished home with just a matress on the floor and a table for my computer,he even got one of those green office chairs,you know the cheap ones with no arm rest.How generous!

Turns out he gave away my birds btw,to some jackass from the home country we don't even know.Haha how good can it get!!

A couple months go by and I notice my moms acting different , drowsy,tired all the time.Turns out he's been giving her fluoxetine and xanax to keep her mellow and preventing her from protested the abhorant living condition we are in.

So now everyday,12 hours a day ,drinking and calling his buddies on the phone n talking absolute rubbish like ,""you know in my past like I was an Irish king"" and ""westworld is such a complex tv show"" 
He yells and laughs so loud at night we cannot sleep and when me or my mom ask him to be quiet he simply ignores or tells us to close the door and put earbuds in.This guy is a narcissistic psychopath!

And when his boss calls him asking why he hasn't sent his paperwork he makes excuses like I have medical issues and will be delayed in my work,he then proceeds to call the buddies again and Bitch and Moan about how bad his boss is and how bad he has it.

I'm so fucking tired of this guy,he is the bane of my existance,I want him dead I want to die I don't wanna be here anymore,Its been like this since july 2019,its almost may 2020 now.Im tired,Please Anyone Help me get out.","Ik this is long,I was told someone here could help me",Super_genius420,2020-04-22 22:30:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g6axqy/ik_this_is_longi_was_told_someone_here_could_help/,1,1.0,10,11,1293
domesticviolence,"Hey Everyone,

Sorry, this is long. But the first para is a good TLDR. 

I need your advice, as former abuse survivors. How did you ever broach the subject with your current S/O without feeling scared of how things'll change? My bf found out by accident the other day about the extent it went to and I'm scared. I never really went into my past to my current bf. I just said they didn't have a good relationship and would fight all the time.

I never told him about my dad who would beat my mom all the time and how he stopped and got help after the authorities got involved, and I'm really proud of him and my mom for working it out :'), but its still been a really big, shameful secret I have. That I come from a family like that, etc, that I'm not normal, etc.

I'm trying my best to go about in the world as a person who comes from a well-adjusted background, not as someone who came from such an...impoverished background, and it works. I have mostly gotten over my PTSD, I don't get the shakes anymore from loud, sudden, noises. (Still pretty scared of loud, strong men, though lol. I also absolutely detest watching any violence on TV) I'm pretty much depression free. I haven't had any suicidal ideation, no urges to hurt myself, etc. Those melancholy episodes where it feels like you're walking through a murky swamp? GONE!

I put in a lot of work into myself for two years after I turned 18 and went to college. I went to the hospital, stayed in the psych ward for 10 days until I could transfer to dorming. I went to Outpatient therapy for 3 months and did DBT, all while attending college part-time. I also earned money and lived alone during the summer so I didn't have to go home while taking classes then too. I got a therapist the following year, started to do Yoga again, Meditation, Pranayam, and even went to a self development course called Landmark. I became closer to God again. I changed my life, thanks to God's grace. It was a lot of work to get myself in a healthy state before I carefully decided to date again this past Fall semester of 2019.

And I met him. We had the same class together, and I wasn't initially attracted to him. I just thought he was intimidatingly smart. We happened to be introduced through mutual friends. We all as a friend group would hang out together, and as time went on we spent more and more time together alone, just studying and goofing off. I was pleased by how many of our values towards the world, life, and living aligned. How we could talk about all sorts of interesting things. It just felt...easy. Natural. I felt myself, for the first time, falling for someone with my mind, not from the intoxicating mix of chemicals that come from an initial attraction.

I quelled any feelings I thought were coming up, though, because he had a gf at the time, but he broke up with her sometime later. We started talking a little bit later, cuz he had feelings for me too. I was really hesitant to enter the relationship, though. For one, he just broke up with his ex. Another, I was just flat out scared of being physically involved with someone. I'd been in a relationship before where my sexual boundaries hadn't been respected, and I was working on asserting myself and being ready to discard anyone who didn't respect them. But it was the next level to do that sexually versus telling someone no to hanging out, lol.

But he stayed. He was patient. He listened when I called him out. He never, ever got mad and raised his voice at me. He was okay with us just being platonic until I was ready. He was actually the one who took me to the place on campus for the sexual assault victims cuz I was too scared to go alone. He made a mistake or two, but he nonetheless was hyper aware of how important respecting my boundaries were to me. Not even my family was that respectful of them. I didn't even know I could be treated so well until he came around.

It was definitely a tumultuous few early months of talking, given all these things, but come Spring semester when we decided to make it official, there was just calm. I was finally ready to be physical with him and it was mindblowing. I didn't know I could feel so good. It was awesome, like a friend that I could cuddle and have sex with and talk about the stars and our dreams and growth and roll down grassy hills and climb trees with. It was so chill. Other than the initial confusion, in our talking stages (given where we were in our lives) there was never any other conflict. I never knew someone who so wholeheartedly supported me in my ideas and invested so much time in me. Each time I would cringe and try something new, a new boundary ('sorry, I'm tired, I can't hang out', or, 'I need to concentrate now'), and new expression of myself, it was just met with acceptance and joy.

But there was always that fear in the back of my mind...what if he snaps one day? What if he just up POWs me across the hall like my dad would my mom? What if its so far in the relationship that we have kids or something? What if he finds out and then takes advantage of my past to...idk....control me, shame me, hit me, hurt me. What if, what if, what if...you get the idea. But I couldn't tell him all this because I was ashamed of my past.

Then he found out. He just up asked me, 'Hey, has your dad ever hit your mom? Or vice versa?'.

He asked because he'd witnessed his neighbors in a DV altercation during quarantine and he texted me about it for advice, but he didn't get to the point (who was involved? was it just something he watched on tv or was it in his house?) because he wanted to text it like a story...smh. I obviously misinterpreted the text and thought he said it was his family because he said he 'saw it with his own two eyes'. I told him that yes, such a thing had happened in my home as well. THEN he backtracked and said it was his neighbors.

I got angry. I felt betrayed. I didn't know what to do, my deepest fear, him finding out, was out. He responded with how sorry he was and insensitive he was for not thinking of my emotions. He told me how proud he was of how much I'd done in the past two years. How I'm working to make the world a better place now. How I shouldn't feel ashamed for how my family was like that because unlike many, we were blessed to rise from that place in our lives.

But...I don't know how to act now. With him. I'm not ready to face these fears of mine. I think. It's just so emotionally intense. I wanna focus on school and learn the most I can and enjoy my career. I think I should just break up with him even though it sucks, cuz I'm not emotionally ready for such a facet in our relationship. We've only been officially going out for like 3 months really. Its too intense. I just wanna roll in the grass and talk about our dreams, not have stupid therapy sessions of my past. I have a therapist for that. I just wanna keep things light-hearted, not too attached. If he knows about my past, I'll be too attached and I want to pace these things. Those wounds of mine have scabbed over and the crust has fallen off, but the skin is still tender and pink.

I don't know. He's good for me, but am I ready for a good thing yet? I still have so much to work on internally.

domesticviolence,"Last July, I kicked my bipolar, borderline, and abusive fiance out of the apartment and he moved back in with his parents in another state. There, he finally got back on medication and got his health stabilized. So stabilized, in fact, that we decided to go on a one month vacation together in February. After the vacation, he was supposed to go back to his family and continue his recovery and treatment.

Then COVID-19 happened, and guess who got stuck with me during a mandatory stay at home order that has been extended into May and possibly longer? 

The vacation was wonderful, and he was stable. When shit started to go down, he started having panic attacks and his anxiety was through the roof. He has severe, uncontrolled asthma so it's a serious threat to his health. We self isolated the week before the stay at home order thinking it would pass by quickly and were very wrong. 

Ever since his mental health has slowly deteriorated. After the panic attacks came self harm, insomnia, hypersomnia, mania, depression, you name it. He was always careful about not hurting me, though it hurt me to see him hurting himself and struggling so much. It finally reached a climax today where he just fucking snapped and held me at knife point for half an hour while I begged for my life. 

He mentioned how angry he is that I get upset when he keeps me awake when I am trying to sleep before work and ask him to go into the living room until he is ready to sleep, but he's also pissed off that for the 2-4 hours a day that I work in the living room he has to stay in the bedroom. My sleep and my job are two things I can't compromise on, but apparently they are fucking life ending deal breakers in his mind.

I guess I just needed to rant. As soon as this is all over he's going back to his family's house and that's that. I'll be stuck continuing to try and pick up the pieces and struggling to save up money for a car so that once I graduate in December I can actually get a high paying job and not cause my parents to lose their houses from defaulting on student loans.",I Made A Mistake,DailyAdventures,2020-04-22 00:48:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g5rhxr/i_made_a_mistake/,1,0.64,3,4,387

domesticviolence,"I'm writing this post because I'm not sure how to help my mum and sister with the current situation they're in. Any thoughts or words of wisdom would help a great deal.

I live interstate, a good 12 hour's drive from my parents and sister. Both my mum and sister are currently experiencing a surge of verbal abuse from my dad who a few weeks ago, was stood down from his job thanks to the unfortunate combination of working in a pub and COVID-19. The conditions of being stood down means he can't access sick leave or holiday leave and he's been stuck at home with no income. He's voiced his anger at the situation and has said to me on the phone he's going crazy being stuck in the house all the time. He also has a medical condition that's limiting his mobility‚Äînot that it excuses his behaviour. 

My parents are of the generation where you don't divorce ""for the sake of the children"" and they're from a very proud and stubborn Eastern European background. My mum has stuck with my dad despite the fact he loves to verbally abuse us and enjoys playing the pity card when he's called out on his behaviour. Quite often, we become the arseholes in his eyes who have ""no respect"" or ""think we know everything"". 

He literally turns into the worst monster if you trigger him by being a little too honest or a little too sarcastic or, God forbid, ungrateful for everything he does‚Äîpart of me wonders if these bursts of intense anger and hatred are heightened from years of alcohol abuse. I used to run into the kitchen as a kid, when my dad would yell at my mum in his drunken, disgusting daze, thinking I could stop it. I'd tell him to leave her alone and then, of course, it would be my fault. Tonight's phone call to my mum and sister is bringing back those emotions and memories‚ÄîI'd thought I'd worked through them with my psychologist but it seems like it's a lifelong battle to get there.

I can't count how many times this cycle of abuse happens. And I can't even explain in words how deep his voice gets and how much blood-curdling hatred comes through when he shouts. He is actually terrifying.

My mum's been worn down by his treatment of her, she literally doesn't make an effort on her appearance or anything and in the past, she's said that she doesn't want to be alone. 

My sister‚Äîis deeply depressed, gets epilepsy that's triggered by stress and struggles to get out of bed, most days. 

It's breaking my heart knowing my sister's caught mum crying this week, while she herself, is crying on the phone telling me what's been happening. Meanwhile, dad talks to me on the phone like everything's peachy. 

I worry about them and I literally don't know what to do. The reason why it feels different this time is because I know my sister and my mum are quite fragile and there's no income they can rely on for support. I've tried repeatedly to transfer money into mum's bank account but she just refuses help.

domesticviolence,"I had a very very severe case of trauma panic attack because of Domestic Violence, my mom put a knife sort of sharp object pushed me to the wall when I was injured and couldn't have escaped. I screamed on the top of my lungs for help. My body was shaking uncontrobally. Without the help of my cousins, my other family members assisting me to calm me down I would certainly have had a very rough time. At the same I was already suffering from anxiety and being stuck in my room 24 hrs a day because of quarantine. I was afraid, I didn't know what was happening to me, as of even right now my hands are still shaking uncontrobally as it just happened 10 minutes ago or so. My intention for writing this is to  calm my nerves and at the same time seek help and document what I am right now feeling. I'm 16 years old and for the first time of my life this is the first time I've experienced such a very severe case of trauma. My stomach was empty during all of this, I have a cast on my left hand after fracturing my 4th metacarpal bone and at the same day I had my worst panic trauma whatever attack which is today I had an accident stubbing my toe. My movement was deprived due to this meaning that when domestic violence was put up against me it took 100% of my will power to grab my mom's wrist and scream at the top of my lungs and run down the stairs. My family thought it was a fire but it was domestic violence. We had an argument or more of like a tantrum of me when I got my injury I would like to admit that as a 16 year old and of conscience i was in a state of rational thinking wait this isn't right I shouldn't be doing this I'll fix my room etc. I got hugged against the wall with a knife/sharp object very close to my throat. I was scared, cold, clueless when my severe trauma attacked. The uncontrollable shaking lasted for hours before it gradually slowly got better all thanks to my kind and loving cousins. But during that time including my nasal polyps makes it hard to breathe I was very sure I might pass out and I was unable to move due to the shaking of my body.

domesticviolence,"Recently my roommate has been having a new guy over sometimes, and while I was in the kitchen making some food for myself this morning I saw her with a massive black eye.  
  
She brought it up herself and said she ""took a tumble"" on her bike... Maybe I'm imagining everything and that is what happened... But I'm really suspicious because we instinctively do everything we can to prevent our heads from being hurt when we fall. And even if she did fall on her head wouldn't it be more likely that she would have hurt her forehead or something? I dunno, it just seems very strange - especially with the timing of her seeing this new guy. She's quite a timid girl and the guy gives me really bad vibes...  
  
I only just moved in pretty recently and didn't know her at all before that so we're polite but aren't close by any means. So I don't think she'd be willing to open up to me about this.  
  
One other detail is that she's overweight so maybe that could play into the injury being more likely or her self-esteem being lower to the point of being willing to date someone abusive. I really don't know...

domesticviolence,"So this is my first time dealing with anything like this and hopefully the last- I got caught up with a guy who I now see was a narcissist and an abuser. He even already had a record for domestic assault (and his ex had a record for attacking him as well) - but because I somehow don‚Äôt know how to take red flags seriously, or at least didn‚Äôt until now, I still dated him. I was only looking for something fun and casual and he was the one who kept saying that he wanted more (even though he still lived with the ex- it was a mess). Because of the fun and great sex I kept letting it go on and on even though I knew I couldn‚Äôt really trust him, and then he started saying things about wanting to move in together and have me meet his kids and how he wanted to marry me even though I‚Äôd never met his family- it was absurd. On one of these nights where he was drunk and professing his love to me he got a text from his ex that made it obvious he was still stringing her along as well, and I flipped out and told him to leave, and it ended up in a physical altercation where he pinned me to the ground and choked me. He could have just left or held me down but he used his bicep to actually cut off my airways and even though I was choking and gagging he wouldn‚Äôt let me go. When he did let go I called for help and then he would put me back in a chokehold and when I kicked the floor to try to get the attention of my neighbor he taunted me for doing so. It was straight up evil. Once I finally got the door open and away from him I asked my neighbor to call the cops and stood by the door so he couldn‚Äôt leave. He kept threatening me by saying they were going to arrest me for starting it, but once they came and questioned us and took pictures of the marks on my neck they arrested him instead. 

The next day I got a call that he was being tried for a felony for second degree assault. At the time I felt shocked and guilty at the fact that I might be ‚Äúruining his life.‚Äù He has a nine year old daughter and a son. But then because of covid they are not trying any cases and everything has been pushed out to at least July, and today the domestic assault advocate and prosecutor called me to ‚Äúhave a conversation‚Äù about the case and see what ‚Äúmy thoughts were.‚Äù It all seemed extremely laidback. The first question they asked me was if I was still interested in having a relationship with him, to which I said no, and they really didn‚Äôt ask me that much about what actually happened. I definitely got the sense that they wanted me to say that I didn‚Äôt care what happened and/or if it got tried as a misdemeanor. So I‚Äôve gone from being guilty to feeling like not enough is being done, because I *did* get choked and he *is* a raging misogynist who has abused women multiple times in addition to being a cheater and liar, and he should get penalized. So I‚Äôm not sure what to do or if those of you who went through court cases not in the time of covid think this sounds normal or what advice you would have for me.",Court in the time of covid?,Useful-Lion,2020-04-18 00:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g3e9lt/court_in_the_time_of_covid/,2,1.0,3,6,604
domesticviolence,"Basically the title. We've had problems for a long time and deep down I've known. I have amazing friends and I am close with my family. I've been hiding the bad parts of the relationship for months because I don't want people to worry about me, and I want the good to keep going. I'm so in love with him. 

After significant escalation in the past few months, I'm at my breaking point. Crying on another twice-weekly therapy session yesterday, my therapist told me to take the opposite action of what shame makes you want to do, which is hide things from the people you love, and open up. So I did. 

He's accused me of having BPD and I've seen three mental health professionals in the past three months who've proved that wrong. When I suggest that I'm proud of myself for growing, he demands to know if I'm ""going back on"" the things I've said about getting better (I'm not ‚Äî I've come far and have far to go). He says I make myself seem ""easy"" by seeking validation with other guys, yet doesn't listen when I'm not in the mood for sex or certain sexual things. He says I'm low value. 

If I do something he doesn't like, he bites me or spanks me. I've paid over $800 to stay on trips with him an extra day; $250 to fix his shirts/sunglasses/charger when breaking them was both of our faults. He's literally torn necklaces off my neck while having sex (twice! Hugely sentimental things) and ripped more pairs of my underwear than I can count. He's paid for nothing. I had to beg for him to meet my family and he's very selective about which of my friends he'll meet. I have not met his. I'm putting in 110% effort and have been from the start. I can count on one hand the number of apologies, cute notes, or out-of-his-way things he's done for me. Basically ‚Äî there's no space for my needs and he's got no interest in listening to them.

There's lots of good though. Our love is fierce. The good moments feel so good. He's brought me a joy I've never had before, he's absolutely brilliant (which is important to me), we push each other in good ways (ran a marathon, went skydiving, have done a whole bunch of scary adventures), travelled a lot, and laugh like little kids *often*. He'll say things or do things when we're together that'll just kill me because of how adorable they are, and how goddamn *lucky* I am to share those moments with him. When we're together this happens more than it doesn't. When we're not together, I see him everywhere. He's still the first person I want to tell about the good and the first person I want comfort from about the bad (though I've given up on that). I have gone my whole life desperate to love and be loved. And I love him deeply. 

I understand about his background and try to be compassionate in the moment too. I just worry things down so much they're almost gone completely ‚Äî ask for so much reassurance he won't give me any anymore. We've both become hypersensitive, but the truth is my skin is so worn down my feelings are almost like an open wound. He shuts down when he feels anything and in that way, maybe it's the same for him. 

But I don't know how to do it anymore. I'm becoming meek. I want to be the confident, goofy, passionate, sweet, intelligent, loving, understanding person that I've worked so hard to be. I see glimmers of that person in the rest of my life but I'm losing that with him. I know the only way out is to let go, but I can't wrap my head around it. I don't want to fall out of love, I don't want to lose the good. I don't want a future without him in it. 

**TLDR;** my boyfriend is abusive and I'm trying my best but there's no space for me to exist as I am. I love him deeply and there's lots of good. I don't want to lose the love.

domesticviolence,"Courage is often the first thing depleted from a survivor of domestic violence. Not only do our abusers words and actions convince us we are cowardly and weak, but the little courage we have left is used just trying to stay alive. The truth is, survivors of domestic abuse are some the most courageous. Being in an abusive relationship is like waking up in a war everyday, but you are sleeping with the enemy, and to survive you must care for them and put on a brave, selfless and grateful face as you do it, and try hard not to lose yourself in the process. We survivors have courage, we just use it to stay alive instead of being able to use it to leave. 

After the first time my ex-husband hit me, I googled ‚Äúwhat do you do if your husband hits you?‚Äù We were only engaged at the time but I felt committed to him like he was my husband. Reflecting back now, I realize I did this for a number of reasons:

I wanted to know if one incident of violence made it domestic abuse, or if it could have been a freak incident.

I wanted to know what it would feel like, and how I would be seen, if I came out as a victim of domestic violence.¬†

I wanted to know how many of us were out there.

I wanted to know how many others had a seemingly ‚Äúnormal and happy‚Äù marriage, but their partners just lost their cool sometimes.¬†¬†

I wanted to know if the next punch was inevitable, or if I could do something to prevent it.¬†

I wanted to hear that domestic abuse was obvious, and when it happened, you knew without a doubt that it was abuse, and knew you needed to leave.¬†

I wanted to hear that other marriages had experienced and survived isolated incidents of violence.

I wanted to hear that I didn‚Äôt have to leave the love of my life. That we could get through this.¬†

All I found in that google search, almost 10 years ago, was a yahoo answers page with a discussion forum between other people who had experienced violence in their romantic relationships. I was relieved to see that no one said blatantly that leaving was the only solution. I was also relieved that I couldn‚Äôt relate to the other people in the forum's experiences. Everyone described repeated abuse. Violence much more severe than I had experienced. Everyone described being hopeless, with no money, family, education or work experience to fall back on, and use to re-build their lives. I had all of those things. I graduated with honors from a good college, I had a career, I was the primary breadwinner in the relationship, I had loving and supportive family members who loved both of us. Therefore, what I experienced must have not been domestic violence, just something else. Right?

I was relieved, I didn‚Äôt have to leave.¬†¬†¬†

The only thing I explicitly recall reading that stuck with me was that people and marriages can recover from violent moments, if and only if, the abuser takes their actions seriously, and seeks help and treatment for their issues causing violence. That night, I went home, and told him that we could get through this as long as he took his actions seriously, was genuinely remorseful, and made sure it never happened again. He swore, through his tearful eyes, that it would never happen again, and that he loved me. He couldn‚Äôt believe what he had done. He was sorry. I believed him. I stayed.¬†¬†

The next two and half years were a blend of wonderful, happy, and fairy tale kind of love moments intertwined with jaw dropping, nose breaking, life threatening nightmare moments. We planned our wedding, we went to pre-marital counseling. We got married, and moved into a cute little cottage in our favorite part of town. We adopted a dog, and started raising him together. We danced in the living room regularly and cooked dinner together. We laid on the couch on lazy Sunday afternoons. We took mental health days together to talk and work on our relationship. He also came home sometimes and told me he was going to kill me. He hit me during arguments. Grabbed me by the neck and threw me onto our bed when he was ready to sleep before I was. He came after me when I tried to leave and one time pulled me out of bed by my hair when I was trying to sleep after being yelled at and tormented for hours.¬†

I was in love with and terrified of my husband all at the same time. I was exhausted and worn down by his words. I didn‚Äôt know it then but I had started believing the demeaning things he said to me. I was confused, and towards the end, I had zero space away from him to try and sort out what was going on in my head.¬†

Finally, thankfully, he hit me in front of our friends, in public. The cat was out of the bag. I finally saw what was happening to me through looks in my friends eyes. I left, but that was just the beginning. (I will talk about my recovery at a later time)¬†

That google search could have helped me leave. It could have helped me see what was happening. It didn‚Äôt, not because I was lacking courage to leave or stand up for myself, but because I was in the cycle of abuse and it‚Äôs hard to see the red flags through black eyes, and think rationally with a broken and tormented heart. 

I honestly don‚Äôt recall if I saw the National Domestic Violence Hotline website. If I did I wouldn‚Äôt have selected it because reading it would have told me what I was not ready to hear. That I was in an abusive relationship, and that the night before was just the beginning. That it was only a matter of time before I could relate to the stories of repeated abuse and trauma I read on the Yahoo Answers Forum. Looking back I realize I did that google search to find excuses for my abusive husbands behavior, not for help. I was not ready to leave, and it was because I had been being groomed for that first punch starting years before.¬†

Admitting you are in an abusive relationship takes a lot of courage. A scarce resource for survivors of abuse. It is not scarce because we have less courage than other people, but because we tap into our courage every moment of everyday to stay alive.¬†

Once I started to see the abuse for what it was I felt so cowardly and ashamed of my lack of courage that I worked harder to hide the abuse, not harder to leave. I told myself, ‚Äú that I had the chance, that first time he hit me, to leave. I could have kept my family, friends, and myself from the pain my abuser caused.‚Äù This narrative kept me from leaving, kept me from seeking recovery, and kept me from seeing that I did have courage in the midst of the abuse. I was just using it to keep our marriage alive, and not to keep myself alive. Once I saw a glimpse of the courage I had, I started to see it everywhere. I came to realize that I had had courage all along, I just let my abuser make me believe I didn‚Äôt.¬†¬†¬†

If you are in the thick of abuse and having a hard time admitting it, please please please know that it is normal to be where you are. It is normal to not want to say it out loud. It is normal to not always know what the next right decision is. Please don‚Äôt think your fear to leave, and fear to stay is because of weakness, a lack of courage, or because the things your abuser tells you are right. Please don‚Äôt think it is proof that you deserve to be where and treated the way you are. Please know, if you are being abused, and still reading this blog post, you have courage.¬†

As always, if you are in an abusive relationship, I strongly encourage you to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text LOVEIS to 22522. Speaking with an advocate is a healthy and safe way to practice admitting you are being abused and receive the support you deserve.",You Have Courage...Believe It,dvsurvivor15,2020-04-17 02:14:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g2t17b/you_have_couragebelieve_it/,24,0.97,27,4,1405

domesticviolence,"He‚Äôs been gaslighting me for years and admits he hit me but won‚Äôt admit how bad it was and even says it was my fault he hit me most of the time. I feel absolutely crazy. 

Most mutual friends didn‚Äôt even know we were in a relationship bc we wanted to hide it. So if I told them he was physically abusive to me for an entire year, they‚Äôd likely laugh it off and take his side saying I‚Äôm just some crazy female.

I used my last money today to get an uber to my sisters so she could do her homework today, but I can't stay here. A family friend blessed me, she is letting my 7 year old daughter and I stay in a beautiful little cottage she owns, with two bedrooms, furnished, and doesn't expect rent until I get stable, which is amazingly kind of her. 

Little background, I left earlier this month after 14 years of an abusive marriage, sexual, physical, financial, and emotional abuse. I made this throw away account the day I left, and have gotten so much support. I am REALLY afraid he is right, I can't take care of us on my own. I am so afraid that I won't have a choice but to go back to him, when Kindness runs out and I still can't pay rent. I just dk. I am constantly looking out my window, afraid he's going to find me, and I won't be strong enough to say no. Or he won't take no for an answer. I am working to get a PFA but courts are closed, unless I called the cops after he hit me, which I didn't. I did see a forensic nurse the last time, because he broke my cheek bone, but declined to have police involved, but I at least have her exam on file.

If you read this far thank you, I know its kind of rambling-ish. I'm scatterbrained and scared shitless still. I am waiting for a call from social services, to see if I can get signed up for benefits even though we are legally married and he makes more than the cut off wage to be eligible. And you have to be separated for six months to be legally sep. where I live. So its one thing after another. I had $200 not last week but the one before, I got as much food as I could with it, a easter basket for my daughter, and spent the last on an uber. Idk what I'll do when food runs outs, maybe beg someone for a ride and go to the drive up food bank. I hate this. I hate him for doing this to me. And I hate me for letting myself depend on him so much for 14 years that I am like an 18 year old instead of a 31 year old woman. The fiancial abuse made it so I HAD to depend on him to live.

My mother (50f) has been and still is both verbally and physically abusive to me (18f) and my sister (15f). I take most of the heat as my sister and dad (50m) aim to please her as to not anger her (are they enablers?). I have a suspicion that she has narcissistic personality disorder but I'm not a professional so I can't diagnose her.

Backstory:

Ever since the lockdown began she has become increasingly easily agitated, will find any excuse to be angry at someone and is incredibly paranoid that we are sick.

Today she got angry at me and slapped me multiple times on my back, then proceeded to hit my arms (I just got a flu vaccine today and she aimed there). When I was defending myself (i.e grabbing her arms to prevent her from hitting me and blocking her hits) one of my blocks ended up touching her face - and by touching I mean barely grazing, but she started yelling and crying that I slapped her. My dad came outside and started yelling at me to let go of her and grabbing my arms, but she was the one holding onto me. Then she took an IKEA shoehorn (the long ones) and tried to hit me with it. After I blocked a couple of hits, she took my dad's chef knife (about 10inches long) and threatened to cut my arms if I didn't let go of the shoehorn. Then she threw the knife and told me to leave.

I locked myself in my room (but she has keys to every room in the house) while she proceeded to cry and make herself the victim (saying why does everyone do this to her, she did nothing wrong etc.) and threatened to divorce my dad too. She took my phone and snapped the SIM card so now I don't even have a way of contacting emergency services or my friends.

A couple of my friends have offered to pick me up and give me a place to stay if needed, but if I leave it will both make it worse, and I'd likely not be able to return, and as I'm still financially dependent on them, leaving is not an option.

So what can I do? I can't call the police, can't leave and I can't explain to her and make her understand because anything I do might make it worse. I also can't access counseling through my university, and I can't call a helpline because she took my phone and snapped my sim. I personally think there's nothing I can do except put up with it until I have enough money to leave, but that's hard at the moment since I'm out of work due to COVID-19 (I was a runner in a cafe)

TL;DR - my mother is becoming more physically abusive. What solution is there to make me feel safe?",How can I get help without letting my abusive mother know?,TA2453,2020-04-15 14:39:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g1t5xi/how_can_i_get_help_without_letting_my_abusive/,9,0.96,18,11,484
domesticviolence,"My dad has been abusive and aggressive towards my mom since I can remember, and right before we had to start staying in place I finally had convinced my mom to get a divorce.

I finally let my older siblings know whats been going on. They are all 15+ years older than me so they never got to see how violent things got. Theyve begun to help pay the bills my dad no longer wants to pay for us. And helping us with legal resources. I hate the timing of all this but more than ever I want to push on and finally see progress to help my mom live a better life. 

She is very strong and I know she never felt she needed police to be involved because she isnt afraid of him. Even after he locks her out or breaks her things. But she does fall victim to saying that the next time he hits her shes leaving :(. obvs hasnt been the case. 

For me i get very nervous around my dad. And I become emotionally distressed staying home whenever both my parents are home. Before, my boyfriend would come for me whenever I couldnt handle being there. Right now is a little harder to stay away from home but I still go with him when I get into panics. 

Since coming out about this to one of my friends, shes offered me her spare room to stay in for as long as I want. Even move in my computer so I can still work/do my online studies.  I want to so badly but I feel so much guilt that id be ""abandoning"" my mom. Even though I absolutely would still be helping her with legal things and coming over when she needs help. I feel scared leaving her alone with my dad and what could happen without me in between them. He doesnt go out of his way to hurt her. They dont even talk and he tries to never be in the same room as her. But he gets mad or annoyed at anything she does and that's when things escalate to 100. I'll be turning 23 the 18th and my whole life has been torn from wanting to get away but not wanting my mom to be alone. I dont even want to be here when it is my birthday.

My mom had only started working at a hair salon right before covid shut everything down. She has no money of her own, my siblings barely get by themselves. Because we're low income the legal aid of Los Angeles for domestic abuse can help us but things are only over the phone for now. Im still thinking whether or not to move out my things bit by bit. I dont care if its unsafe to be out in only scared for my mom. After we have a phone meeting with a lawyer and also a social worker I'm going to think of my choices from there. I know my mom doesnt want to stay here either. Shes told me she also feels uncomfortable here. But she hates how this has destroyed me emotionally and if I want to leave I can. But she's the one being abused and I feel I'm not the one who should get to leave whenever I want to. I want much better for my mom, but maybe the only option right now is to see what the lawyer and social worker can help us with...

Tldr right before stay at home came in place I started the process of my my mom divorcing my abusive father. We've gotten in touch with the city's legal aid for domestic abuse, but the amount of help may be limited or will take longer because of the current state of things. My friend has offered me her spare room to live in since being home with both my parents is destroying me emotionally. But I feel extreme guilty about leaving my mom, and that she doesnt have where to go but I do. Im in so much anxiety staying home but id feel guilty moving out.  Im unsure how to deal with this guilt or what the best plan is.",Want to vent but also need advice,staticderp,2020-04-15 12:00:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g1qkrh/want_to_vent_but_also_need_advice/,2,0.86,5,7,707

domesticviolence,"Good morning. I joined this group this morning in hopes for some advice. I've included some back story, but the advice I'm seeking begins further down. 

Long story not so short, I was in a relationship with a narcissist for  3 1/2 years. I knew it was a bad relationship, but I was in a bad place. About the time I decided I deserved better, I ended up pregnant and decided to stick it out (bad move, I know) and see if he would change. Obviously he did not.

The relationship was terrible. He was mentally, physically and sexually abusive towards me and was addicted to methamphetamine and smoked marijuana literally all day long. I was working full time and he did not work. He lived off of $400/m of SSI. My parents had to watch our son while I was at work because he wouldn't. I could never leave my son with him for more than an hour before he would start blowing up my phone if I didn't come home. He never spent any of his money on diapers, clothes, food, or any kind of care for our son. He would hit me, spit in my face, yell at me and threaten me. He would force sex on me. He would threaten to have men come into our house and rape me if I didn‚Äôt comply. He would tell me if I didn't give him money to pay for his drugs then the dealers would find us and hurt my son. He told me if I tried to leave he had taken pictures of me asleep with a meth pipe and would have my son taken away from me. I lost many friends and was isolated from my family because of him.

When my son was 2 1/2 he got angry when I told him no and spit in my face, as he had witnessed his father do to me many times.That's when I finally made the choice to leave. I moved back in with my parents. He still did not give up. He was stalking me, threatening me, telling me he would kill me or send his drug buddies to my parents' house to kill all of us. There was another situation which ended with him being arrested.

Fast forward to 2018, I moved from Colorado to Nebraska. He was released from jail and was given supervised visits with our son, for which I would drive my son to Colorado. Shortly after, he ended up getting into some kind of trouble at the halfway house he was in, they don't provide me any of the details, and was moved to a minimum security prison in Colorado. A few months ago I received a letter notifying me he was moved to a different medium-security prison. A couple of days ago I received another letter informing me of his parole hearing coming up in June.

The letter informed me that I have the right to submit a victim impact statement. I've never been through this before and I'm not sure what a victim impact statement is or what should be said. I've tried researching it on the internet, but each article seems so different from the last. Has anybody else ever submitted one and, if so, what kind of advice can you give me?

I just wish it were possible to never have to have any kind of contact with him again, including him being part of my son's life. The last 3 years my son has had a different man in his life who has taken on more responsibility than his biological father ever even tried to. This man has even suggested wanting to look into being able to adopt him, but even that I'm not sure of the possibility to make it happen with the way things are with his biological father.",Victim Impact Statement - advice??,lalaland302,2020-04-14 14:26:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g16gs3/victim_impact_statement_advice/,7,0.86,5,5,641
domesticviolence,"Hello, I have been with my (20f) boyfriend (25m) for a year and a half now and I have finally chosen to open my eyes to see he isn't the one for me. I moved in with him to escape the physical abuse, sexual assault, and neglect that I was experiencing at home.

I tried to take a break for my mental health (I told him that) for the first time a few days ago because I was just tired of us fighting over the smallest of things and it was affecting my mental health. He automatically went on a rant about how 'I won't be dating other people while I'm living with him' and he gave me a month to leave knowing that wasn't an option due to the fact I have no money and Coronavirus is happening (everytime I tried to get a job, because I had time while in college at the time, he'd get mad and tell me that I needed to focus on school ONLY like I was his child).

We made up after but I feel the same. I feel like he would just threw me out on the streets if he felt I deserved it.

I no longer feel anything because I now remember a lot of things that I didn't notice early in the relationship such as he made insensitive comments on my depression and anxiety coping methods, he'd throw away my important school things such as notes when angry on a video game so he can piss me off too, and importantly, he would repeatedly ask why I wasn't over my still recent sexual assault from my mom's boyfriend.

I understand his perspective but it isn't that easy and he thinks that my depression would instantly just go away if I didn't do certain things such as think about my assault (which is impossible if I'm just back in the same environment) and cut off the only person I have in my family. I didn't grow up with a father so I do not have anyone else unlike him.

I have taken a few steps such as saving up my 'allowance' but I'm struggling to act as if I want to stay any longer. I never thought I'd be in this situation.

To be short. I am diagnosed with Shizotipical + OCD 

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2010 to 2018 I was in relationship (she was my first and only sexual partner and lover in traditional sense)

We used to leave all this period apart ( I leaved with my parents, she leaved with hers)

However she over-controlled me and controlled my social contacts. It began with simple ""stop talking with that female colleague of yours"" and in last year of relations became something extremly sinister and constant.  I felt trapped in this relations and really thought of suicide.  I felt that she can force me to do whatever she wanted and I couldn\`t say No. 

However somehow I managed to cancel this relationship. 

However, 2 years later I am still plagued by it. I feel that on the one hand I still love her dearly despite all the pain, on the other hand I am afraid that she will return in my life and take control of it again.

Somehow I am quiet vulnareable to guilt and she can use it (tears and other stuff).

Speaking about guilt-vulnerability, I am also can\`t permit myself to start new relationship or just have simpe casual sex (though it would be difficult with OCD anyway).   
Fore some unfathonable reason I feel that my body (sexually) is her property. That I must remain loyal to her (despite the fact of breakup). I don\`t even let myself to hug a female friend since I see something sexual even in casual hugs. 

I used Tinder, but always kept distance in order to avoid even light touch and always made clear that we are not on date, we are drinking socially.

I even dont\`t let (or try to not let to) my mother to touch me since I feel sexually harassed. I realize that most touches are social, however I can do nothing with that feeling. 

What else is important?  
I leave in Russia and teach economics&amp;political science 

I take antyspsychotic medication and visit therapist 

I am video games nerd and fantasy lover 

I am 32

domesticviolence,"So I need to type this out. It just happened today. I am having trouble coming to terms with it and I feel terrible but need to have a sounding board.  
I am a lesbian in a 2.5 year relationship with a girl who is bipolar type 2 with panic disorder and adhd.
She is on medication and sees a doctor.  
I work during this pandemic she does not.  
We recently moved in together only after basically living together for the past year.  
She has had 1 other really bad episode before where she got manic depressive and threatening. Wanted to break up with me. Called me names and insulted me.  
Her doctors adjusted her medication and eventually months later she was ok.  
This time around, it started around two days ago, she started to get verbally abusive. She would tell me Im pathetic and she wanted to break up with me. We were no longer couple. She would shout and scream at me for no apparent reason.  
However today something new happened.  
At 3 am she comes in from the spare bedroom where she had been sleeping and cuddles up with me.  
I get up at 6 am and I tell her I love her. She says I love you back so I am thinking we are getting back to normal again.  
At 8 am she starts getting fidgety saying she doesnt know what to do.  
At 8:30 she gets up and says if I ever tell her I love her again she is going to cut herself and goes to the kitchen to get kitchen knives. I hear the kitchen knives on the counter.
I have a history of domestic abuse by the way.
So I go in to try to get her to stop cutting, she has the knife perpendicular to her wrist.
She grabs the other knife off of the counter and comes at me. Chases me out of the house with both knives. I grab my house keys in case she locks me out.
She manages to wrestle my phone out of my hand while I grab my keys. I had taken photos of her and the knives. 
She takes my phone and locks herself in the spare room, deletes the photos.
I have a co-worker on chat call the cops for me because she was chasing me in my front yard with knives.
She drove to her moms an hour south of here.
The cops filed an incident report of a domestic disturbance.
She is saying that the relationship is over.

domesticviolence,"Hello,

I'm not sure how to proceed with this situation so I decided I should ask for an advice, maybe someone would see the things differently.

So a little background first. Short version my mother's mental health is a piece of shit and she thinks is just fine.

Long version - I guess mental issues are transmitted over the genes since I am not so well too and also seem to remember clearly most of my life, but the most bright memories I have are from the traumas I had, especially the ones my parents did to me. As a kid, I was constantly punished for everything, grew to be very closed-in-myself teenager who wanted to kill himself (still thinking about doing it). When I was little, I really liked to ride a bike, still had supporting wheels, and one day I apparently rode it so much that my mother locked it away and I never saw it. Guess what, now I am over 20y/o and can't ride neither bike or roller skates or anything. Probably if it wasn't for my asthma maybe I would had to teach by myself how to swim. Next, one day I went to play with the kids next door and we played hide and seek. I hid so well, no one found me for 2-3 hours. I was hiding with one other kid too. When our mothers found us, the other kids mother cried of worry. Mine beat the shit out of me. This is the day I recall as ""my mother doesn't love me"". Then my father left, because he so much couldn't stand my mother that almost killed her. But also being drunk. Up next living with mentally unstable parent who had to take care of two kids weren't easy. For the kids. 11 years ago, my grandfather died which was so devastating, as he was the person who took care of me whenever my mother was god knows where, so devastating, that it made me stop believing in church/god/religion and all that bs. Took me a while to process. Then for some reason, after the next Christmas we stopped gathering with the other half of the family - her sister/my aunt - years later to found out if was a matter of money from the will. My mother apparently was ripped of which she kept to herself unlit 2 years ago when things went south.

But there is this thing about my mother - she is the greediest person in the world. There was always chocolate in the house, but the food she was buying while we were growing was the cheapest shit in the store. One of the many reasons I grew up  with weak immune system. The amount of unknown meat and instant rammen we consumed is unmeasurable. But let's get back to the part with my grandparent's will.

She got enough money to invest and buy an apartment. This same apartment is still empty 11 years later. Nothing was done inside. I've only been there once, my brother never even seen it. 11 years - nothing. Waste of money. While now I have to spend half of the amount spend on that apartment to fix my health and teeth, because there was no money, again, 11 years ago, to get me braces. Now whenever someones ask me to smile, I have to leave, because I am sick of crying in front of other people for what a shitty life my mother build for me.

Let's continue with the trauma. A year after my the death of my grandfather, can't remember what could have been the reason, maybe a bad grade or didn't do the dishes, but I've got my mother screaming at me and throwing a suitcase at me to pack my thing because I am going for adoption. Of course that didn't happen because of my brother's crying like someone is being killed. This scene repeated itself 3 more times. Every time was devastating. 

Later on I grew up so she couldn't beat me any more, but the constant screaming continued. Whenever I asked about the apartment, there was a scene. Whenever I wanted more money for school so I could actually get something to eat, there was a scene. From 1st to 10th grade my daily allowance was 1$. No matter that the prices weren't the same any more, that was it. 20$ a month. School days only. At least I learned how to manage my budget so I could eat 3 times a week while being at school. But whenever it was a matter of money, there was a scene. There was the constant threat that I am going to sleep under the bridge if I don't behave, which as a teenager was really hard.

My mother, the scrooge, never supported me in anything. I had passion for arts - music and drawing. But she never believed in me. I had to save money from birthdays for 4 years to by myself my first guitar. Took so long, that at the time I got it, I didn't have time to play. Never supported my drawing too. So I left that too. And I was forced to stick with what brings money and so I am working since 10th grade so I can be independent. But that wasn't enough. 

She always undermined my knowledge, because you see, she is 63y/o now with masters degree who is working at 2+ places to make a minimum wage and half, while I don't even have a bachelor degree and am getting 5 times what she makes and know 2 languages besides my initial one and constantly read books and articles to keep my knowledge up to date.

But here is another problem with her, beside probably being bipolar. She stockpiles things, useless things. Boxes full of baby clothes, drawings of me and my brother from the kindergarten, 30+ y/o documents which are unreadable, jars, brochures, tons of plastic packages from food that was eaten months ago, old medicine which expired years ago, old electronic that doesn't work, EVERYTHING. She is like the character Plyushkin from Gogol's novel. Just piles junk. For years I used to clean the house whenever she's gone for more than two days. But it is like the Jedi - it returns. She is just strong with the trash. And the house is more like a junk yard. Because of all the trash there is no place to store my things or even worse - our clothes.

Few days ago, after she threw a two weeks long rant because her boss is canceling all the work cell phones the firm issued, continuously screaming for no reason and blaming us because she can't find her of phone in the mess I stood up and kicked her out of the room. She then forced her way in the room and then I snapped, forced her back into the other room and told her to leave the house immediately or I'll call the cops. Since then she refuses to leave and now even acts as nothing happened. And here is the tricky part - I own the apartment we're living in, not she, because it wasn't hers on papers initially and she never made the effort to fix that and the only thing she owns is that empty trash she bought 11 years ago.

TL;DR starts here to summarize the rant.
My mother is a greedy scrooge, a trash collector, abusive, toxic that ruled over my and my brothers life fro decades because of her old fashioned ideas and not wanting to accept that we're in 21st century, Stalin is dead and things has changed a lot since the post-war times. I got sick of her acting as the king of the world, constantly throwing threats, not giving a shit about other people's opinion, no sense of personal space and boundaries. I after so many years of patience and enduring shit from her, I stood up and told her to leave willingly or else I'll be forced to call the police and force her out. Since then, three days ago, she has occupied the kitchen, doesn't want to leave and acts like nothing happened.
I am really patient and can't decide what to do next since I suspect that being such a monster she doesn't have where to go, but this is the one person in the whole damn world that I hate the most and can't stand anymore to live in my home.

Last May, my Grandmother passed away.  My Uncle inherited her home and all the belongings in it.  He asked me and my wife to move in with him.  I was hesitant, as I have pets (dog and cat) and told him as much.  He agreed to let them come as well, so me and wifey packed up and moved in.  I even paid more then we agreed in the beginning.

The last month has been compete HELL.  He's not well, he's an alcoholic, and he is verbally abusive to my wife while I am not around.  I won't get into specifics, but she does not feel safe when I am not here.  I work a seasonal job, and it's about to start (first day was today, had to come home early to, I guess protect her)

Long story short, the cops were called, and he was informed he couldn't just kick us out, cause he wanted us to leave immediately.  I tried to tell him it wasn't legal to do that, but, like I said, he has mental issues.  We agreed May 15th we are out (hopefully sooner) but my question is this:  Is it LEGAL for him to deny us bathroom/kitchen access?  Does he have the right to just say ANYTHING he wants to us as long as we are here?  Because he is down right abusive verbally.  Can he force us to stay in this tiny ass room? And If were to  get a restraining order...how would that work if he owns the place?  Can I get a restraining order for PAST issues  or do I have to wait for him to do something else?  

My wife is a saint.  She's not ""hard"" at all.  I have no idea why she's with my vulgar, basic ass, but she is.

This means I forget to dispose off garbage, put things away, or do something in a specific way even when my partner asks me to. I also use social media quite frequently, because I share a lot of thoughts and opinions about topics I care about. Both of these things upset my partner a lot and they say that it seems like I'm ignoring what they say purposely and that is what makes them really angry. They say that my frequent use of social media makes me forgetful and that reducing it will help me remember things better. The fact that I don't reduce my use of social media, that I use it even when they're talking to me or trying to spend time with me, and that I do not check their messages when I'm out with other people is what is causing them to get upset and angry.

A couple days ago, I forgot to throw away a plastic bag that contained a bedsheet cover set and ended up leaving it by the bed. To alert me to the fact that I needed to throw it away, they came and tried to put it on my head. I assumed they were trying to put it around my head and I got scared and upset and I told them this. They clarified that they were trying to put it on my head, which to me doesn't seem any better. Is putting garbage on your partner's head something that is considered okay, even if it's done playfully?

This isn't the first time they're doing it. They've come and put garbage I haven't thrown away on my table. There are times when I (unwittingly) leave stains on dishes that I have cleaned. One time, they brought the unclean dishes and put them on my table.

When my partner is angry with me (specifically in this instance), they sometimes slam doors or bang the cooker on the kitchen counter (I have to point out that they don't do this all the time). I've heard that this constitutes abuse and I genuinely get scared when they do this. A couple of hours ago, they swept everything off a spare table on which I keep my boxes of incense out of anger so that they could start packing a bag to leave (they didn't eventually, because our country is under lockdown). Am I crazy or is this not okay? Am I justified in being scared that they might hurt me?

More importantly, is any of this comparable to me being forgetful? Am I being malicious by being forgetful or doing it out of spite? I'm not even sure if I'm reporting this with all the facts.

I genuinely don't know if I'm right or wrong. I know I could make a better effort to remember things.

(When I said anymore, this is what I meant: They caused an injury on my face while drunk in 2018, which had to be treated with surgery. I hit them back during this incident, they're no longer physically violent, and they've stopped drinking. This happened because I asked them to leave. I haven't since, because I hoped they'd change. I asked them to stay, even though they offered to leave at the time.)",I'm confused,mananabananafanana,2020-04-13 11:43:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/g0hdup/im_confused/,9,0.67,2,2,569
domesticviolence,"So I tried posting this in r/relationships but the mods took it down and recommended I post here.. Not sure if this belongs here because I think the abuse is two sided in this case but.. I guess it's worth a shot.. 

We've been married for 2 years now, we‚Äôre both 22. We got married quickly, and (stupidly) without really knowing each other's bad sides, due to the military. (he is no longer in the military now) I guess the reason I'm here is to ask is there anyway this marriage can be saved? Do you think a toxic and abusive marriage can turn into a healthy one? Neither of us want to be divorced, I never imagined myself having to go through that especially at a young age. It's hard for me to imagine having to start over from square one with all this extra baggage I'll have.. Anyways I guess I'll give an example of how bad it is (from both sides) by telling you what happened during out last big fight. (I think this fight in particular he acted worse, although I started it but I assure you I can be just as bad as well - just in different ways)

So a few days ago we started arguing, things were getting heated I felt very furious, hurt, and disrespected, and kinda frankly lost it. So during the argument I threw the blue joycon (half the nintendo switch controller) and aimed at his head. But I missed and hit the wall instead. That made him furious, so he bashed the table I was sitting at towards me. Then he threw the nintendo switch at the wall full force (luckily only pieces of it broke off) Then he left the room. At this point I was pissed because I thought he broke the switch, but I wasn't really yelling anymore I was more like (wtf dude!) and he was still extremely angry. We argued some more, him being way more angry compared to myself, the switch wasn't broken... I would of probably lost it if it was. But I was still extremely mad, and felt like our marriage was garbage so I threw our wedding ring into a full trash bag. Then he freaked out and bent me over and started pushing my head towards the rotten trash telling me to dig it out, I refused, then he let go of me and dumped all the trash onto the floor. We fought some more but that was basically it.

So that's what happened, and fights to a similar caliber (and even worse) happen maybe once a month? Sometimes more frequent. He's broken door frames, smashed in doors, (mainly trying to get into a room if I locked it), he's smashed a tv, etc. But he's never really hitten me, the worse he's done was push my head down to the ground so I couldn‚Äôt escape his grip or try to force my wedding ring off my finger. I've hitten him, and scratched his face. (a lot of what I do is mostly unintentional I just kind of lose it) I've ripped chunks of my own hair out during fights, and have become literally hysterical, and incoherent due to a fight. We have both threaten suicide, me more often than him. But he does worse gestures than me. Literally dry firing a gun to his head for hours with hopes he'll load it on accident due to muscle memory. Anyways.. It's bad. We both probably have really bad mental health issues... We need a lot of work. It's really bad. Is there any chance to save it... Should I even want to? He seems to want this marriage more than I do.. I mean I do too.. But I want a healthy relationship... not this... But I don't want to get divorced either... What should I do? There are some details to are relationship that are probably really important that I don't really feel comfortable mentioning... but yeah that's the jist of it.","Not sure if this belongs here...

I left him after he physically assaulted me in a public place.
The only person who knows how bad it was in private is my ""best friend"". 
When the final incident that lead to me leaving happened, my best friend was there to witness and told me she was ""glad it happened"" so I could now feel like it was ok to leave, as everyone had now seen how bad things were.

Bit of back story, her husband grew up with my ex partner.
I was understanding that they maintained a friendship after everything, as they had known eachother most of their lives.
However, since the break up there has been a few incidents where I have been left feeling like I am the problem for leaving him. I've let these go and just tried to ignore it.
I never pressed charges against my ex and just tried to move on as I didn't feel mentally strong enough to deal with this.

However, tonight, while we are in lockdown (and not meant to be socialising with people outside our household), it has been posted on social media that my ex partner has spent the night drinking with my best friend and her husband.
I feel so hurt and betrayed, how can you be this comfortable around someone who treat your best friend this way?
Why after everything do I feel the one in the wrong, and left alone?
I feel I lost everything and he gained from this situation.
I am so hurt alone and dont know who to turn to.

So it‚Äôs like If he hugs me I have to immediately give him attention even if I‚Äôm busy doing something otherwise he starts yelling at me grabbing my face and pushing me around/usually onto the ground. He yells things like ‚Äòwhy dident you hug me back‚Äô ‚Äòeffing bitch‚Äô etc 

We have sexual interactions a lot but again he gets violent if I‚Äôm not 100% enthusiastic and paying attention to what he‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôs to the point where I feel I have to pretend to enjoy certain things or else he‚Äôll start having a fit about it.

Sometimes he will randomly during some time of the day come up to me and demand to know why I haven‚Äôt been with him all day. He gets in my face and he‚Äôll push me as he is talking to me. Most of the violence is him pushing me. He dosent hit or strike me. He has slapped me before but he dosent really do that anymore. He just pushes me into stuff or up against the wall or will shove me into the floor. 

One time he shoved me and I hit my back against the bookshelf corner so I shoved him back. Not very hard he dident even move. He retaliated by gripping my hair and spitting on my face. 

He yells a lot and he usually dosent stop unless I start crying.

domesticviolence,"My husband and I have been together for 20 years and married for 16.5 years. I am 33. My husband has always been emotionally abusive and manipulative, but since we've moved overseas (non military) it's escalated. It's now physically and sexually abusive as well. I don't have family, I was emancipated from the foster care system at 16. He's been the only family I've had for the past 20 years. It's just gotten to the point I can't handle it.

We moved to the middle east for his job 8 years ago. He's adopted a very controlling attitude since we've come here. I am not allowed access to money, to house or car keys, to my identification or my passport (he stores these at work when he caught me trying to take them). I'm not allowed to leave the house (he locks me in), to have friends, or to work. He recently let me have a phone after a fire broke out in our garage and I had no way to call for help, but it's got spyware and a keylogger on it and most websites and apps are restricted so I don't use it much. 

I take his phone sometimes when he's sleeping deeply, which usually happens after he rapes me. I have tried to search for information to help me in incognito mode. I was able to contact local authorities once and they told me that I'm his wife so he can do whatever he wants with me. Basically for the last 8 years I've been trapped and I'm worried I'll never get out.

domesticviolence,"Posted this in r/rapecounseling but got no response. Thought maybe I'd get some here. 

Quick backstory: My(F) first BF was sexually and psychologically abusive. I had no previous sexual experience before him other than some attempted rapes and sexual assaults with people I was getting to know. I knew him for a year before our relationship started and it went from heaven to hell real quick. So basically, I am today diagnosed with C-PTSD which I've been in treatment for during the past year. Before that I was bouncing from one abusive situation to another... Not knowing I even had boundaries. But I have come a great way and now feel ready to maintain healthy romantic relationships.

I have started dating again, and I have noticed a problem that keep coming up with each new guy... It is like a bad circle which I wish to break. So I am really attracted to the guy and after weeks of getting to know eachother we have sex. Then usually he wants and initiates sex again, which causes me to enter a FAWNing state/dissociation. He does not notice this... (only one guy I've dated noticed and took precautionary messures from that point on. The others seem to not understand why I cannot just say no, and keep expecting me to do so). Afterwards I am in full blown dissociation. I feel less safe with him after that, so my libido plummets. And he initiates again, repeating the previous scene of events, and so it goes in a circle. Each time he does not see me... I lose trust. And in the end I leave the relationship because it is hurting me and I don't feel seen or understood.

How do I not get triggered by them wanting me and initiating? How do I stay present enough to say no? How much can I expect from a partner when it comes to patience and accommodation for my mental health?

I have applied to meet a sexologist for these issues and have also stopped having sex until I've been in counselling with one. But because of covid-19 everything is delayed, and I cannot find any information on this specific issue online. Thought reddit might have someone who knows? Anyone else who has had similar problems?

domesticviolence,"I need reassurance somehow that I‚Äôm thinking clearly about a decision to leave my boyfriend. 

A little backstory... I was in an abusive relationship for almost 5 years. It started out with just verbal abuse, isolating me from friends and family then escalated over time to physical abuse. We have two children together so I found it difficult to leave. I was a new mom and scared, but when he tried to strangle me that was the breaking point. This relationship ended about 3 years ago.

I was extremely hurt, and embarrassed about having to start my life over. I had to move back in with my parents at that time until I got back on my feet. Within about 8 months I moved into a new place, started going to therapy and felt great. Around that time I bumped into an old male friend. We ended up hooking up a few times, but it turned into a really close friendship. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a FWB because once we got close we weren‚Äôt intimate. He was just a really great friend who I trusted. He was super supportive and I enjoyed his company. I made it clear I wasn‚Äôt nearly ready for anytime of relationship, and he understood that. Now over the past two years he‚Äôs been over for every holiday, birthday, etc. He was my best friend. The end of 2019, feelings started to change and we decided to give a relationship a try. I felt after 3 years I could handle having a relationship. 

Everything was great until I started having some PTSD from the past abusive relationship. Disagreements occurred and I would breakdown because in my mind I was so used to things escalating quickly. I would get scared and leave during arguments because I didn‚Äôt want something bad to happen. After talking through it and addressing some trigger moments, he again was supportive and understood. It‚Äôs only been 6 months into this relationship and now during arguments he‚Äôs starting to get aggressive. He whipped a coffee cup off the table during talking, a week later he spit in my face, then when I tried to leave he ripped my purse off me and it ripped in half. 

I know that I have trauma issues. I know that I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm not screaming or throwing things or exhibiting any behaviors like that. My move is to escape. I always leave when I feel like it‚Äôs escalating. I can‚Äôt handle the stress when someone‚Äôs angry I get scared and overwhelmed. Am I wrong for wanting to break up with him?

However my sister has told me several times that he used to get in terrible moods out of jealousy when he hears about my sisters past boyfriends. 

My sister just came to our door 20 minutes ago bawling her eyes out saying that he had hit her and punched her because of an argument fuelled by his jealousy again. She was in a state. My mom demanded my sister give her his number. She then called him and demanded to know the situation, he denied any claim of abuse despite my sister repeating that he had hit her. He was apparently crying but i grew up in a semi abusive household myself, crying was a common form of manipulation to gain sympathy. My mom gave him a warning even though i was demanding she got the police involved so that if my sister was not telling the whole truth then it can be properly sorted. After the call, my sister was crying saying that she loved him and that calling him made everything worse and that we shouldn‚Äôt get the police involved. She then stormed out and drove off still crying. My mom and stepdad just left the situation at that and went back to their day almost as if nothing had happened. 

This completely frustrated me so then i began shouting at them for acting like nothing happened and that we should take things like this more seriously because i have heavily studied domestic violence in the past and have heard dozens of stories where violence turns to murder.

hey. I don't know where else to post. I don't know what to do. I will try to keep this as short as possible.

This week I(f,22) finally broke up with my abusive fianc√©(m,27). We've been together for only a few months.I fell in love with him because he understood me and we had a lot in common. and even moved to his country for a while. He was perfect in the beginning, made me happy but a few weeks after we started dating, he started being abusive. He shouted at me every single day, told me what that everything I do is wrong and used me for sex. Right now he is in my country. He has been here for 2 months and on Monday I finally kicked him out of my apartment. I booked an airbnb for him and bought him groceries for a few days. I tried to keep the contact to the minimum.

It started Monday night. He kept texting me, calling me names, calling my mom in the middle of the night, threatening to kill himself because of me. Then today, his friend texted me that he thinks my ex bought heroine. (he has a long history of abuse but never did heroine). I unblocked my ex and saw that he sent me videos of him trashing the airbnb. It is in my name so I decided to give in and show up there. He wasn't at home. (or was and just passed out cause of the H?). There is another thing. A few days ago, he texted me, threatening to beat me up. He was never the violent type but he is in an emotional state where I dont know if I can trust him to do nothing. I locked my doors, closed all of my windows. I am just done with this. When I was walking home, I thought about everything and came to the conclusion that I won't cry over him anymore. I want to be done with this. but should I be threatened? what if he killed himself over me?

I dont even know anymore what I am scared of. that he is dead? that he is going to come to my place? should I go to the police? should I call the ambulance to see if he's alive? I blocked him every where and right now im just sitting at home, unable to think of a solution for this. fuck

I know this is all over the place but I am really confused right now.

domesticviolence,"I have been watching the domestic violence statistics rise and have been watching documentaries about it which has left me wondering whether I should inform the parents of my ex that he has hit me once. I still have their phone numbers, after I left him a couple of years ago they even sent me a message that they were going to miss me. I know for a fact that he did not tell them about it when it happened and he threatened me so I would not tell them, so I am pretty sure that they do not know. I also think they think he is a perfect person who would never do such a thing. I was wondering if me telling them would maybe make them discuss it or more watchful when he enters a new relationship, which might help prevent someone else from getting hit.

About the situation when he hit me, I was crying and wanted to leave his apartment to go to my own because he was mad and screaming at me for a joke he didn't like, he didn't know how to handle it so he hit me to make it stop and make me stay. He was raging. I asked for permission to go to the toilet and was allowed, but instead I immediately fled to his roommates room, woke him up and asked him to protect me while I called my parents. The roommate thankfully waited with me until they arrived and escorted me downstairs to their car. After the incident I stayed in the relationship until I had found a safe way out, that I was looking for since the moment this happened. Although he initially apologized for the incident, he did say that he found it my own fault and pretty much thought he couldn't have done anything otherwise in the situation, which was, and is, bizarre to me and makes me think this could definitely happen again with someone else.

I have not spread stories about him or anything, I have only discussed this with my closest friends and family. I am currently in a very happy long-term relationship. The purpose of telling his parents is also definitely not to make him look bad, but to help prevent such incidents in the future with new people in new relationships. However, I am uncertain whether it will make me look like a bitter ex, whether it will lead to him telling negative stories about me in our shared community (which can impact my career and education as he works in a similar field) or even him looking me up to confront me about telling them. I am also whether it will have any positive impact at all. What do you think I should do?

UPDATE: based on the advice I received in the comments, for which I thank you all very much, I have decided I won't contact his parents as it won't bring anything positive.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right thread, but if it isn‚Äôt, I would greatly appreciate it if I‚Äôm directed to the proper thread. Also please excuse my English as it is not my first language. 

A bit of background information for you:

My dad passed away one year ago unexpectedly. The whole ordeal was extremely hard on both me and my family. Most of us were able to get through the grieving process, but my mom never really fully recovered I think. After about three months after my father passed away, my mom started talking to some person that she met on Facebook. The guy claimed to be from Vietnam and they even Facetimed a few times. Initially I was a bit worry myself that she was moving on a little too fast. She was still emotionally vulnerable as she was still visibly grieving my father passing away. She would still talk about how much she wished that she was with him, how she wished that she was the one who passed away rather than my father, etc.

Strangely she would often have similar conversations with the Vietnamese guy friend as well. Even though she would heavily talk about my father on the phone with this guy, he still proceed her romantically. He would often sweet talk her and it did have an effect on her mental well being. She was finally going back to her normal self. Though after I found out that she was sending money to him (a few hundred dollars I can‚Äôt remember the exact amount) I brought up how she was being scammed. I told her she was being taken advantage of and that she should see a therapist for help, but she rejected the idea completely because she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù She told me that she prayed a lot about the guy and that she had a ‚Äògood feeling about him.‚Äô Eventually the two of them fell out due to minor religious differences.

About a month after falling out with the Viennese guy, my mom told me that she signed up for a dating website, were she can meet people that have similar religious beliefs as her. Less than a week after signing up, she ‚Äòmatched‚Äô with a guy. While he initially seemed nice and I did talk to him on the phone a few times, he eventually revealed to my mom that he was currently in prison. Apparently he has a violent past, though it didn‚Äôt go as far as killing anyone. My mom seemed attracted to him regardless of his violent past, stating that he asked God for forgiveness and he has repented for his sins.

I was obviously mad at this point with my mom‚Äôs decision as the guy could be obviously lying to her. The guy‚Äôs been in prison for over 25 years, and there was no way of telling if he actually had a change of heart. After about two weeks of talking, they eventually got engaged. I told my mom that this whole situation was crazy. One of the early signs of domestic abuse is moving the relationship along too fast. Obviously getting engaged in less than two weeks of knowing someone is a red flag, in my opinion. I eventually ended up talking my grandma of the whole situation hoping that she‚Äôll be able to talk some sense into my mom. Which she somehow managed to do. I have no idea what my grandma told my mom, but it managed to work as she eventually ended up cutting ties with the prison guy.

Less then a week after breaking up with the guy from prison, my mom started talking to another guy. Though this guy was one of my dad‚Äôs old friends. They were initially close, though they did grew a little distant after me, my dad, mom, and little brother moved to east coast. About two weeks after cutting it off with the prison guy, my mom gets engaged to my dad‚Äôs old friend. They got married after three weeks of reconnecting with each other and he moved into our home shortly after they got married.

Of course when I met him I was suspicious of his motives and past history. Of course this guy had a shady past of his own. One evening I heard my mom‚Äôs husband talking on the phone with a friend. My mom‚Äôs husband mentions that he didn‚Äôt attend his court date because he just moved into our home. I brought up what he said to my mom, and my mom shrugged it off. Saying that he didn‚Äôt pay a traffic ticket, though I do not believe that is the case. I tried reaching out to some of my dad‚Äôs old friends and expressed the whole situation up until that point. One of his friends did mention that the police were looking for him in another state due to domestic violence charges due to him harming his previous wife. He is still wanted for that crime on the west coast, and as far as I can tell the police have no idea that he is half way across the country. To top things off, my mom‚Äôs new husband is also buying drugs in mines, my brother‚Äôs, and my father‚Äôs last name. (Ex: let says that my last name is Smith, he‚Äôll order the drugs, have them sent through the mail, and last ‚ÄúThe Smith Family‚Äù as the recipients of the package.) My mom does not have the same last name as me, my brother, or my late father legally. My mom is aware of his actions, though it seems like she is supporting him none the less. When I initially stumbled upon the first package, I throw away the contents of the package as I know that my grandparents had problems with drugs in the past. Though I guess both my mom and her husband figured out that the package has been delivered as they started questioning me about the whereabouts of the package.

I tried bringing the situation up to my grandmother, hoping that she will intervene but she thinks that I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion, even though she is fully aware of my mom‚Äôs history when it comes to finding a romantic partner. I want to convince my grandma that most of the things that have been going on is true, but she mentions that she needs proof before we can even do anything. I looked online and was able to find a case number that is connected to my mom‚Äôs husband on a state county court record database, however it does not list the specific crime that he is wanted for. It only shows up as a criminal charge. I don‚Äôt know how my mom managed to convince my grandma that the charge is for a traffic ticket, but I pretty sure that it is for the domestic violent issue that he had in his previous marriage.

I need all of the help I can get, as I‚Äôm not sure what to do next. I want to go to the police and try to see if they can actually verify if he is wanted, but my mom will noticed if I leave the house. She‚Äôll be able to tell that I‚Äôm the one who reported him to law enforcement and I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôll try kicking me out for it. Is there anyway that I can look up if someone has a criminal history free of charge online? I tried a few sites, though most of them require a payment of some sort. Being that I‚Äôm inside of school still, I don‚Äôt exactly have a job to pay for the results. Any help is greatly appreciated.",I believe that my mom is married to a domestic violence abuser.

domesticviolence,"I am currently in a child custody case, and believe I have grounds to also pursue a domestic violence/abuse against my child‚Äôs mother. I do not have my parental rights at this time so she essentially has all the power right now. The few people who have knowledge of my intentions are strongly discouraging me from going down this path. Their reasoning is that if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person that it will trigger a mandatory investigation which will blow up the custody litigation. That it will look bad in the custody hearing that I am also going after her for abuse. They are concerned with the way it will look and seemingly dismissive of the damage that has been inflicted upon me. They question my motivation for wanting to pursue this recourse. I don‚Äôt want to sabotage my custody case but I have trouble simply accepting their limited explanation of why not to pursue compensation for my grievances. 

Can anyone please explain why I should allow my tormentor to get away with the two plus years of abuse she inflicted on me? Is it merely a question of timing? I am trying hard to accept the counsel of those whom I respect but I have a trend of regretting not trusting my gut in a situation like this. I do not have a clear understanding of what options are available to me so I am not clear about what I want (besides an end to my pain and injustice).

domesticviolence,"Hello, 

I need some advice, my parents abusive, and have been for a long time. I moved away to go to university but because of Corona I had to come back. Usually I would stay in my university's town during the summer semester for work, because I wanted to get away from the violence and their nasty personalities in general. 

Anyway what I feared happened today, my dad hit me. I think it was because I wasn't paying attention to him and because I didn't move when he wanted me to. I actually did defend myself though, I kicked him in the balls...which made him madder. Anyway, I ended up running to my room, locking the door and crying to my boyfriend, who is the only one in my life that knows that my parents are physically abusive towards me.  

I don't know what to do now. I could go back to my university as I have a place their still, but no food. I'm on a student budget so I don't know if I can afford to get groceries.  My place is also in a student condo, and is an high risk area for Corona. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to live like this. 

I know it doesn't matter that much, but I have one other question, which is kinda related:

Why didn't my boyfriend offer to help me ? Or to take me in....I guess it doesn't matter.

Anyway any advice you give me would be great.

domesticviolence,"Ever since I was around 7 years old, i was raised in a abusive/DV household. I am turning 20 soon. I know it sounds crazy, but i didn't know ""domestic violence"" was a thing and how common it was until a couple years ago. Ever since I was young, whenever my mom and her husband would argue/fight, it would get violent. I'm sure he has anger management issues because he gets angry over small topics/conflicts. My mom's husband would yell like a psycho. He would threaten us, break things, harm himself, or harm others including my mom. I am not the only child in this household by the way.  Luckily, we have some voice recordings of some of their fights in case the police gets involved. I've been verbally and physically abused by my mom's husband when i was younger. Whenever they would fight, i would feel helpless, I wouldn't know what to do. The only thing I could is just cry because i'm sensitive, easily an anxious, and weak.. I know the first thing I should do is call the cops, but i can't get myself to do it.. i don't know if it's because i'm afraid of her husband or i'm afraid that the cops won't help for some reason or maybe it's a mixture of both. I really want to get some type of help and be in a better place because this is negatively impacting my mental health and how I perform in school. At this point, i don't know if im depressed. Growing up, my mom didn't care about how i felt and she thinks that it's normal to be in a situation like this. I guess it's because her husband will act nice to her again, so she's okay with it. She thinks that he will change despite everything he has done. She would tell me ""just look at it as a normal thing, no family is perfect"" but i refused. I don't think that families should fight like this. Living under these conditions has caused me to have suicidal thoughts. I'm very afraid of how my future will be like going thru these traumatic experiences. I'm trying to be a strong person and actually call the police if these situations happen, but it's difficult without having any support. please provide any advice or resources that could help me with my situation, thank you.",advice?,icyjieun,2020-04-09 05:09:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fxmcc7/advice/,7,1.0,3,1,401

domesticviolence,"Hi, so I'm 22 female and my partner is 25 male. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and I found out my partner was talking to other girls and I brought this to light and he told me he never loved me and is only with me for my kid. I said that's all I needed to hear and was going to try and leave when he grabs me and  starts beating me with his phone on my head. The phone ends up cracking and breaking and he blamed me for breaking his phone and that's when he starts punching me in the head, I went into fetal position to protect the baby and I hit him to get him to stop. His beautiful black lab dog had gotten on the bed to bite him, and he ended up punching the sweetest dog and I started hitting him in the chest because he punched his dog and needed him to stop but then he kicked me in the stomach and started choking me and that's when I backed down because I could tell I was losing oxygen quicky, I was in fear for the baby.  I kept repeatedly asking if I may please  leave and he said I can't leave because he's scared I'm going or calling the cops. He won't allow me to leave and now I'm in fear for the health of mine and the baby's health. I have bruises on my face/temple , head, and neck. I actually couldn't control the shaking I was experiencing, and that has never happened to me before, I believe I was genuinely terrified. Does anyone have an advice? Not just leave but a plan, he's asleep right now, but I'm scared if he heard me try to leave he will beat me or hurt the unborn baby. 

 I'm genuinely scared and just want to have a safe exit without being harmed and even then if I leave I'm nervous he will have someone hurt me or he will do it himself. 

Thank you so much!! 

UPDATE: I want to first thank everyone who responded to me. I feel like people who read this think ""why doesn't she just leave"" or ""is she that dumb "" , and right now it's not that simple. He had told me before he would kill me and the baby if I have ever tried to leave. He genuinely has nothing to lose and I believe him. He has threatened suicide and I believe he would make us part of his plan. I'm currently safe and he ended up waking up while I wasn't in bed and my night had gotten much worse for me. The next morning I let him have intercourse to me, because I was scared if I didn't he would punch and hurt me all over again. I should have known better. I'm actually in so much pain today from all the bruises and the abuse. He ended up blaming me for his phone again and said I hit him first and that he was too drunk to remember but he's sorry. None of that is true, I would never hit someone unless they hurt me first. Second, him being too drunk is a lie. I've dated him for a long time now and everytime he gets drunk I look forward to it because he becomes the nicest and most patient person and just wants to sleep. He kept saying I had to pay for his phone and I told him he beat me with it and he denied it repeatedly. Then eventually said he did do it but it was my fault. He beat me again in the morning and he wanted to drive my car to work when I was just trying to leave to go home. He also broke my phone further by using his knee because of his phone. So we are in the car headed to his job, and he apologized but kept saying I started it and I'm a jealous bi***, but he actually cheated on me. I started crying as quietly as possible because I was overwhelmed with the situation. When he looked over and he had seen a coworker, he drove further up ahead and started punching me in the back of the head and he told me to stfu or he would would beat the sh** out of me. I tried to calm myself down and then he hit me because I wasn't sitting in the car ""right"". We get to his job and he asks for a kiss and I said I wasn't comfortable, he said , ""rot in hell"", and left my door open.

domesticviolence,"my friend recently confided in me that her fianc√© had ‚Äòsmacked‚Äô her in the face because he had gotten angry that she went out for drinks with me without telling him.. 

She did tell him where she was going though I was literally there when she said it he was just angry that she dident reply to his messages that night very quickly. He honestly messaged her every 2 minutes and if she sat there and replied to them all she wouldn‚Äôt have had time to do ANYTHING else. 

I was so disgusted when she told me this I tried to convince her to leave him but she refused. 

We‚Äôve been friends for years but since that night we‚Äôve become a little distant and I 100% believe it is because of him. 

She‚Äôs afraid of him. She dident say that but it is very obvious. She gets all quiet and shy when I bring up how much of an asshole he is or how she use to be so happy before she was with him and she just shuts down and changes the subject 

He talks to her like she‚Äôs a dog. Even in public he‚Äôll yell at her, call her dumb etc she dosent say anything back to him which is very unlike her usual self ( this girl use to pour drinks on people who were rude to her) 

I imagine he does much worse when they‚Äôre alone and no one is around. 

She dosent do anything about it. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs just fallen asleep and doesn‚Äôt care about how bad he treats her anymore. 

It‚Äôs the worst feeling to see my friend treated like trash and even worse to see her just take it and not even try to stand up for herself. And then even worse when she looks genuinely terrified when I stand up for her and tell him to stfu or I tell him to stop demanding things of her. 

One time I was over at her house and she broke down in tears because he‚Äôd burnt all her dresses and told her they were too ‚Äòslutty‚Äô for her to wear. 

I‚Äôm so ENRAGED I want to rip this guys balls off so bad I honestly don‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs done to her because she‚Äôs just anxious and afraid of upsetting him all of the time. Which is not her personality at all. 

I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to keep distancing herself from me just to make him happy and she‚Äôs going to be left isolated and alone with him.

I want my friend back. Or even for her to just be happy again... this whole situation is breaking my damn heart 

I‚Äôve tried to get her help. I texted her domestic violence helpline numbers after she had told me he hit her in the face. She told me not to send that kind of stuff because he reads her texts and would be upset if he seen it. 

She knows she can text me anytime and I‚Äôll call the police on his ass and I‚Äôd come pick her up and she is always welcome to stay at my house for however long she needs to.

domesticviolence,"This is probably going to be long, and I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this and will delete if that's the case. I just have been needing to put this all out there for some time now and I can't think of better place. So here we go

SO I(27m) recently entered a relationship with my best friend (27m) for over a decade, it's also my first healthy relationship. It's been great, except for the fact that it's been bringing up a lot of things from my past relationships that I'd been able to just brush off in the past. My first long term boyfriend of 5 years got me to move to another country for him(i would go back and fourth roughly a dozen times, which my family paid for almost all of despite his family being rich), coerced me into cutting myself off from nearly everyone I knew to the point of starting fights with my friends on facebook. He would always berate me for being lazy, greedy, whatever he could think of to make me feel bad for not doing everything while also never giving me any opportunities to be more. He pretended to want to help me improve my art only to yell at me and belittle me when i didn't get something right the first time. 

But that's just the tip of the iceberg, he constantly made me feel inadequate in bed, forcing me to take a roll I told him from the beginning I wasn't comfortable with, he would tell me almost every time that I was bad, that I was doing something wrong, he'd get angry at me even though I was a virgin when him and I started dating. Not only that, but he took that and used it to try and convince me that I was a rapist. It got to the point where we never even had sex, which he also would use to start fights. Fuck, he'd use literally *anything* to start a fight, to the point where people we'd only just meant would comment on it, his own *friends* would say shit about it. And despite it all even after he hit me in the fucking face, I was vulnerable and desperate enough that i still *married* this man. 

He cheated on me, he pushed every boundary he could and when I tried to stand up for myself he'd scream at me for literal *hours*. He tried to force me into a poly relationship because I wasn't good enough, because no matter what I did I'd *never* be good enough. I spent so much time planning to kill myself, because if that was what my life was supposed to be than i Just didn't want to deal with it anymore.  

So then comes boyfriend number two, who i met while I was still married. I mentioned that if my husband had a second boyfriend I could also have one. He of course was pissed as hell and threw a tantrum. This new guy actually brought up how ex-husband treated me, and it hit me then that I needed to get out, and I needed to get out *now*. This lead me to making a huge mistake, moving into this new boyfriend's house after just a week decision. (stupid I know)

 At first, everything is great, I get a divorce (which i was forced to pay for) new guy tells me he's gonna teach me how to tattoo, I think I've finally made it. Except of course that wasn't the case. I went from being around someone all the time to literally only seeing my boyfriend for maybe a few hours after he got home, during which he pretty much never wanted to talk to me, he never showed really any interest in my art or well, in anything i wanted to talk about. He would get on my case about not cooking even though when I would make us something he would just order in anyway. And it only got worse over time, and eventually the fights started. 

It all came to a head when, after opening up a relationship sexually because just like the last time, he wanted something *more,* he accused me of cheating. Except he *didn't*, he didn't tell me what i did wrong he just kept repeating 'you know what you did' even though I didn't, because I hadn't cheated on him. I was so miserable, I was so lonely, I felt at that time I had nothing to live for, so after begging him for the tenth time to talk to me, I grabbed my pills and the Jack and went to just put an end to it all. 

Suddenly that was apparently enough to get him to tell me what was going on, and of course he apologized like they always do after something like this, and being the broken person that I was, we stayed together for several more months after that before I finally couldn't do it. I had come back to the states because I just couldn't keep not working, and in no time he'd grown possessive out of nowhere, mad that we didn't talk enough when he barely ever talked to me, mad that I talked about my friends or my art. I was done. 

It's crazy, how just these two people could so completely break any level of confidence that I'd had. I'm still trying to fight the effects of these two people, the self loathing, the paranoia that my current boyfriend is too good for me or will get tired of me when he sees how useless I am. The fear that maybe they were right and I'm just truly *unlovable*. It's hard to even properly express it all honestly, both when happened and how bad I am because of it.  I've been diagnosed with some pretty severe ptsd and am trying to work through it all, but it's so hard and there's *so much*.

And what maybe fucks me up the most? Is that my ex husband is still out there, he's even pretty popular, but I'm too terrified to ever actually call him out, and from what I've heard, he doesn't think he did anything wrong and even actively tried to make me look like the abuser. 

My new boyfriend has been wonderful, has known about the baggage I come with, but he loves me anyway.  And as hard as it is, I just have to keep hoping things will get better.","Years after 2 separate abusers, and I'm still suffering",vxrmxn,2020-04-08 04:10:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fwzhhq/years_after_2_separate_abusers_and_im_still/,2,0.86,5,9,1093

I would try to help him and let him stay with me until it would blow up every few weeks. He had gotten physical and threatened me and extorted me all of which I reported but nothing could really be done. He then escalated to taking rocks to cars parked in my assigned spot and also keyed my mom‚Äôs car when she came to visit me the week after. He had been watching and stalking me for awhile.

domesticviolence,"A little back story...
Last year, things went crazy. I left my spouse (m) of then, 9 years, for another man. I moved out for about 5-6 months. Then we decided to reconcile in late October-early November. He knew everything that happened. We have two kids together, I learned later on that the court stuff he made happen was because he was jealous. Understandable. 
Back to it, when I came back he kept bringing up things that I did. Mind you he also had a girlfriend and I had to hide my car at my own house so she wouldn‚Äôt find out. And then the drinking began. It started with just a couple beers at night when he got home from work. Then he quit his job and it became a 12 pack a day, starting mid day. After that it was liquor mixed with beer. And every time he would drink he would get verbally and mentally abusive. Like, extremely. I would beg and apologize every night over and over again. 

That‚Äôs when it it got bad. Really bad. He became an alcoholic. Drinking liquor (vodka) and beer (those seltzer‚Äôs) from the time he woke up, until he went to bed. Every with both kids here with him everyday I was at work. Then he started to say how he was going to kill himself over and over. Every time. The first night he threw a cup at my face I called the police. They didn‚Äôt take him because I said I didn‚Äôt want to press charges. When they left he beat the every loving crap out of me. It happened three more times in the span of a week and a half. The third time I swore he was going to kill me. I was literally clawing at the floor trying to get away. Knocked me out, kicked my ribs over and over, choked me out until I saw stars. All in front of our three year old. Fortunately he didn‚Äôt kill me. 

Thankfully the next day I broke down in front of my manager after I called him and I knew he was drunk, and I showed her all the bruises and scratches. She told me to record everything and call the police if it happened again. Well it did. And I had an hour and a half of recording. Once again in front of our daughter. I was able to make it to the bathroom and call 911 while my phone was in my back pocket. They have the 911 recording and my Apple Watch recording. 

He hasn‚Äôt drank since that night and has apologized over and over. I do love him but I don‚Äôt know if I can forgive him. His family expects me to forgive and forget because they ‚Äúforgave‚Äù me for what I did. That month still rings in my ears every single day. The prosecutor told me she listened to it, and in the four years she‚Äôs been doing this, it‚Äôs the worst she‚Äôs ever heard. 

I really just need some advice and input on if anyone else has experienced this. Thanks in advance.","Everything was okay, until it wasn‚Äôt.

domesticviolence,"
Some background. In San Diego, California. Been in a four year abusive relationship with my son‚Äôs father. He‚Äôs an alcoholic with an addictive personality meaning he goes overboard on everything beer, weed, cough syrup etc. 

A week before our son‚Äôs first birthday, he was on one of his binges‚Äîcame home to our apartment and immediately began beating the shit out of me while our son slept in his crib. The cops were called by neighbors, he was arrested and taken away tied like a hog. I was granted an emergency protective order and kick out order to have him removed from our apartment. CPS was involved and I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I was still wrapped around his finger so I forgave him, he stayed living there and we stayed together. I was granted a ‚Äúno negative contact‚Äù order which is still valid until 2021. 

He did give up alcohol after that incident though he smoked a lot of weed, he was still abusive on occasion but he worked and everything was fine until again a week before our son‚Äôs second birthday. He relapsed. He wasn‚Äôt abusive but he started doing coke or crystal or some type of stimulant he was snorting. He was doing ‚Äú8 balls‚Äù in a whole night, not sleeping and basically quit his job because he was up all night being paranoid and slept during the day. Meanwhile I‚Äôm working and my son is watched by my mother who is a housewife. After a month of this, I decided I was going to leave and got my own apartment which ended up being a studio in a rough neighborhood cause it was all I could get approved for. This was October of last year. 

I blitz‚Äôd the move with help from my family and he let it happen without protest cause he thought I was moving back in with my parents and he was too busy drinking, doing drugs etc. Eventually he realizes I moved out alone goes to my family‚Äôs home crying and begging them for idk what? Forgiveness and to tell me he‚Äôs sorry, he wants to make it up blah blah blah. Again, I end up forgiving him and he moves in with me by Christmas after turning in the old apartment. He gets drunk New Year‚Äôs Day and ends up getting jumped by some guys he was drinking with who tried to steal his car. They leave him head busted open in the street, bleeding and unconscious. He goes to hospital gets better whatever but he then uses this as an excuse not to work which I told him he needed to do in order to live with us. Eventually he does again and whatever everything is cool. The studio is too small for us and the area is super ghetto with no parking so we find a 2 bedroom in a nicer part of town with a parking spot. He is still drinking and often doesn‚Äôt go to work for being hungover so I end up putting 1550 for the deposit and 1550 in first month rent with no help from him. One week after being moved in, he tells me he doesn‚Äôt wanna work anymore he wants to drink full time and that I can‚Äôt do anything about it cause he is ‚Äúthe man of the house‚Äù. Then starts an onslaught of verbal abuse on the daily. He calls me every name in the book, insults me, disrespects me which isn‚Äôt anything new but considering he‚Äôs not working or paying any bills or doing anything productive to our household? Its driving me insane. Coronavirus happens and quarantine but I am able to work from home so I set up at my mom‚Äôs house that way I can be with my son everyday. My son‚Äôs father continues to not work, spend what little money he does have on beer and whatever drug he‚Äôs on and I decide I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I used to think he was a good person underneath it all but he‚Äôs clearly not. He‚Äôs immature, irresponsible, he isn‚Äôt a provider and I can‚Äôt keep supporting him while he disrespects me and threatens me with violence around my son. 

Last Monday, he gets up to go to work but begins cussing me out as I slept. Telling me again he deserves to be able to drink, not work, calling me names and then he tells me to apologize to him because he‚Äôs always told me that everything is my fault such as him drinking or doing drugs and quitting his jobs were all somehow my fault which I don‚Äôt believe of course but it‚Äôs unbelievably frustrating to hear that considering the reality. He ends up attacking me as I get out of bed to confront him. Again our son was asleep in his own bed in the same room. He doesn‚Äôt hit me so much as smash me under his weight and smack the back of my head and pull my hair. He again says apologize to me or I‚Äôm not gonna go to work. I tell him to fuck off and he can do whatever he wants cause I ain‚Äôt apologizing. He ends up going to work and I start thinking what can I do? 

How can I get him removed from our apartment? I worked so hard to be able to afford it, he‚Äôs contributed nothing so far and we signed a year lease. I actually had to break the lease on the studio to come here which my old landlord was gracious enough to let me do with minimal penalty. He threatened to kill me if I leave which I don‚Äôt take seriously but who knows what he‚Äôs capable of. Would it be possible for me to get some type of other kick out order to remove him for real this time? I‚Äôm just afraid to get the law involved because with our last case the social worker told me if there was ever a problem with us again they would take away my son which I understand would be my fault for having my son in this situation knowing his father is abusive to me but what can I do? I have the no negative contact order which has clearly been violated by his verbal abuse, threats and physical abuse? With coronavirus shutting everything down would I be able to file some type of motion to get him removed from our home? 

TL ; DR : Live in San Diego, California. My son‚Äôs father is an abusive tweaker/alcoholic that goes on binges where he quits his job and gets high full time which is the current situation. I have a no negative contact order because of a previous DV case that resulted in CPS involvement who threatened me that another incident would have my son removed from me. My son‚Äôs father has clearly violated that order with verbal and physical abuse as well as threats of killing me. What can I do to have my son‚Äôs father removed from the home by some type of law enforcement? He‚Äôs a lost cause who told me himself all he wants to do is be in the streets drinking and doesn‚Äôt wanna work. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that I‚Äôm baby mama #2, he had a daughter when he was 16 making her almost 9 now. Her mother has a restraining order against him as well for what I‚Äôm guessing is the same reasons I‚Äôm dealing with now. He has 3-4 DUIs too.","How can I get the abusive drug addict father of my two year old son, removed from our apartment?",raxope,2020-04-06 19:35:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fw5cb3/how_can_i_get_the_abusive_drug_addict_father_of/,5,0.83,11,19,1256

domesticviolence,"I live with my fianc√©. We‚Äôve been together around 2 years. We had a small break type thing at the start of this year but it wasent really a break I guess we still stayed in the same house he just slept in the other room for a few nights. 

The reason we had that ‚Äòbreak‚Äô is because of an incident that happened over New Years. He was intoxicated at the time and he just wasent really acting like himself at all. He treated me very bad that night. He fractured the bone in my wrist from slamming my hand on the table and I had purple bruising around my neck from where he‚Äôd tried to grab me by the back of the neck and push me onto the floor. 

He was very violent toward me which is something he‚Äôd never been before. I was very fearful of him after that night but since then nothing like that has ever happened. He‚Äôs back to himself now he‚Äôs very sweet and calm and happy. 

He dosent remember everything that happened on the night but he has apologised for it and he even cried when we realised the bone in my arm was fractured (he came with me to the hospital the next day).

He‚Äôs been sober since that day as well. He was going to have a drink just a few days ago and I freaked out a bit. But I explained to him that I dident think it was a good idea especially since we‚Äôre in lockdown atm so it‚Äôs just him and I at home. He was very understanding and listened to me and he assured me he was only intending to have the one drink and that he‚Äôd never react violently toward me again. He asked me if I would feel better if he dident have the drink and I said yes. He did not have the drink. 

Do you think it‚Äôs ok to forgive him for the one night ? I genuinely believe it was because he was too intoxicated and he‚Äôd also taken something so I feel that affected his judgement and he just wasent himself ? 

The person he is and the person he was that night are 2 different people. I love him so much and feel this might have been just a very big hiccup 

Is this something we can get over and go on to be a healthy couple and live a good life?

domesticviolence,"In my post history, you can see my history with a live-in abusive partner. An element of abuse was present in the relationship for 9 months but only became so severe in the last 2-3, after we became 'official'. I left him 4 weeks ago, then a week later we witnessed a traumatic event together, had sex, and both woke up with coronavirus symptoms. The coronavirus symptoms were bad and added to the traumatic bonding. We lived and acted as a couple for 3 weeks and he was on best behaviour. I am home now away from him.

I've been through a lot in my life so far. I'm 22 but I've battled severe depression, 2 sexual assaults, PTSD, emotional abuse from my twin and watching them go through suicide attempts, and an abrupt end to my first real relationship. This has all been crammed within 5 years, and most of it within 1 year (between the age of 17-18). Every time I've faced a challenge like this I've always been really good at talking about it, finding the help I need, and overcoming it. I advocate for myself to ensure my university or school don't refuse me the support I need, and I reach out to friends. I'm resourceful and have managed to drastically improve my life despite everything.

This relationship is completely different. I don't feel able to talk to anyone about it, I feel distant from everyone in my life even though there's no clear reason why, I don't even want to talk to them. 

I had to completely shut off my feelings of betrayal and hurt to get through the past 3 weeks and now they're coming back. I don't feel like anyone understands. Everyone has their own relationships and problems and they usually project them. Everyone keeps telling me ""it's going to be alright"" but that's not why I'm so upset. I'm not scared. They keep saying ""of course it's sad when relationships end"" but that's not why I'm sad - I don't even feel like it's ended. It's so hard for me to figure out never mind explain to anyone else why I feel so hurt by this. Objectively, I've been through worse.

The worst bit is that he is the only person I trust with my emotions right now. I don't even know why. I understand logically that it's trauma bonding, but that doesn't make me feel like I need him any less or want to confide in others.

I don't want to reach out to resources because I was only abused by him for 2-3 months. I don't feel like those resources are meant for me, especially at a time like this when so many women are trapped with physical abusers. I'm out of my situation now so I don't need help leaving.

The thing getting me through is knowing that one day this will all be one bad memory. I think emotional abuse is very common for young girls to go through, and I can't imagine how many people I know have and don't even understand that they were abused. It makes me feel weak that teenage girls can cope better than me with relationships like this.

Over the past few days reddit has been my main source of emotional support which makes me feel pathetic. I've also devoted a lot of time to university work and reading which helps. I've created a playlist of songs that either help me feel empowered or describe my experience. I'm hoping time will help. Can anyone relate?

For example, many websites have an escape feature throughout the page so that visitors can quickly switch to a more neutral page such as Google or a news article to avoid detection. While some of these sites are able to keep their URL from appearing in the browser history, the data is still stored elsewhere in cookies and, on platforms like Facebook, can be used for the purpose of targeted ads, both of which can endanger the visitor should theirs abuser notice it.

Though that was a blesssing, I won‚Äôt lie, it still hurt me for some reason that he left ME. Like I was the sane one in the relationship, how did he leave me ? I‚Äôm getting I‚Äôve rot now but it‚Äôs still really confusing. 

These last 2 years I‚Äôve been trying to get my life together and repair the damage I‚Äôve put my daughter through. I have always tried to make home a happy place for her and I covered up the abuse. When she was little I would say ‚Äúoh we were playing when you heard us yelling‚Äù or try to make it seem like she just was having a bad dream when she would say she heard us fighting and screaming or I‚Äôd cover up with makeup (I‚Äôve learned in therapy l that I was SUPER wrong and irresponsible for telling her she was dreaming and dismissing her REAL experiences). I thought I was shielding her by making her think it wasn‚Äôt real but the older she got, the more the abuse was done in front of her &amp; it confirmed I had lied to her. 

He has beat me, called me names, exposed our sex life, and more in front of her over and over. She would beg me to leave but I never did. Now she hates me for it. 

She‚Äôs started to rebel about the same time he left me. I‚Äôve tried to take her to therapy with me but she just won‚Äôt talk to the therapist. I‚Äôve tried taking her on nail/hair trips with me and it doesn‚Äôt work. Last year she said she wanted to stay with her grandma and I told her no. I wanted her to stay with me so she can see how much i was gonna change and be better

I know she‚Äôs hurting and I know it‚Äôs my fault but I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I hate that I put her through this. 

Her rebellion is really becoming too much. She talks back, sneaks out, gets into drama, and is just plain disrespectful sometimes. I‚Äôm stuck between trying to be a parent &amp; trying to be understanding of her behavior. I feel like it‚Äôs not my place to try to be some authoritative parent (even though I‚Äôm doing it to try to save her) when I‚Äôve allowed her to see men walk all over me. 

My therapist said that although she is still a child she‚Äôs at the age that I need to have a grown woman conversation with her about womanhood, abusive relationships and low self esteem. I feel like this quarantine might be the best time to have a long conversation with her, but like I stated she wants to live with her grandma. For like 2 weeks she kept going to her friends houses because she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me. This week I told her there was no leaving period! So she‚Äôs been in her room all day and night. She kept saying she wanted to go live with her grandma so I decided to try to make her happy and come to a middle ground. Being that this quarantine might last a month or 2, I asked my mom to stay with us during it. My daughter seems really happy. 

I told my therapist and she said that it was a smart idea and that I should have the conversation with my daughter in front or my mom so that my mom can mediate. I don‚Äôt know how to even start the conversation, but I have to.

Has anyone ever been in this situation of trying to make your kid forgive you? I would appreciate any advice.

domesticviolence,"Hi guys, I've never posted on reddit before but I really need somewhere to turn to. This is something I have never been able to talk about with my friends/family for reasons that may become clear.

I have been with my boyfriend for nearly 2 years now, we are both 26 and live together. Our relationship is (nearly) amazing, we love each other very much and I have been sure since the day I met him that we were supposed to end up together.

The problem is though, he has crazy anger management problems, these were clear from almost the offset of moving in. It started off with just screaming but things have escalated over time. It went from screaming and storming off, to throwing things (once a glass which smashed across the living room), to throwing things at me, he has (maybe in the last 8 months) escalated to physically touching me, he has pushed me, shook me, pushed me on the floor and cowered over me screaming. Despite all of this he has never hit me before and says he never would/could, even when he's all worked up he knows that. Today it escalated even further (I think) though. I came home from doing the weekly shop, which is already stressful enough at the moment given all the restrictions about COVID-19, and as we were both unpacking the shopping I said something he didn't like and he has another outburst which just terrify me now and (this is going to sound ridiculous I know) but he had a packet of asparagus in his hand and he hit me round the face with it. Even though it was only packet asparagus I must admit it really hurt and I can't help but think this is just another escalation. Whenever we have spoken about things afterwards and hes laid his hands on me I've always said how scared I am that he's going to really hurt me one day but he says that he know he never could, even when he's in that state.

It's worth mentioning that none of this is in anyway alcohol related and he is not abusive in any other way. He is not controlling or mean to me, in fact he is amazing and supportive of everything I do and really is everything I could wish for apart from these awful outburst he gets. I would say on average they happen around once a month although there have been times when it has been twice a week.

This comes from such a painful place for him and he knows this is wrong and so wants to change himself which makes this so much harder. I am terrified of him sometimes but at the same time feel so sorry for him at other times. He had been getting help for this. He was seeing a counsellor for a while which i think helped him mentally to understand the deep rootedness of where this anger comes from although the outburst weren't really stopping so we decided together that he should start seeing someone specific for anger management which he did, although i can't tell if this has helped as everything had to stop due to COVID-19 so he is now not seeing anyone.  He has been to support groups in the past as well but nothing seems to help and I just don't know what to do anymore. Nothing he seems to try in battling this seems to work, it's only ever escalated.

I really do not want to leave this man, he is perfect in every other way and wants to stop this behaviour but can't seem to. I'm also at my wits end though, I don't talk to me friends and family about this as I don't want their opinion of him to change as he really is such a good man this is just his downfall. But it's like a dirty little secret that only both of us know. I'm so worried that one day the neighbours might see through the window or something.

Please help, any advice or just thoughts would be great.

domesticviolence,"My best friend and I are both in our mid-twenties and we‚Äôve known each other for 5 years. I left a 3 year abusive relationship about 7 months ago. She was super supportive throughout the whole process and has always been a great friend. 

I‚Äôve been seeing a new guy for a few months now who is kind, has a great job, a wonderful sense of humor, and treats me with respect. Things have started to get serious between us and he makes me very happy. I have also been going to therapy to work through my history of abuse and cultivating my own personal hobbies and growing my career. I am not exclusive with him quite yet because I have only recently been out of a relationship and I don‚Äôt want to rush into anything, but it seems to be heading in that direction at an appropriate rate. 

The problem is, any time I occasionally share something about our relationship (like ‚Äúoh look at this funny video of his dog he sent me‚Äùor ‚Äúwe went to this cool restaurant‚Äù) to my friend she either shuts me down, passive aggressively responds ‚Äúcool,‚Äù ignores it, or says ‚Äúbe careful.‚Äù 

She is in a happy long-term relationship so it doesn‚Äôt seem like jealousy and I try my best not to overshare or only talk about him when I message her. When I confronted her about her attitude, she explained that she was concerned about me falling in love with someone else too fast even though she admitted he sounded like a healthy, nice guy with no obvious red flags. 

While I understand her concern and appreciate her advice, it feels kind of condescending. I want to have a friend who I can talk about guys with without feeling judged or patronized. I always engage her in conversations about her boyfriend and have helped her through her own relationship troubles in the past. I‚Äôve told her how I felt about all this and she seems to think like she knows what is best for me.

domesticviolence,"A few weeks ago I posted here about leaving my verbally and emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend, X, who I also live with. We have two other housemates (who are dating), Y and Z.

About three weeks ago, the university closed down. The bars and restaurants shut down the day after so my house were all spending that evening together drinking and chatting. This was the first time X and I had spoken since the break-up and he was planning on going home the next day. We eventually ran out of cider so X ran to the shop to get some.

Whilst he was at the shop, I was talking to Z about the break-up and she was encouraging me to stay strong and keep my distance. I listened to her advice was planning to make my excuses and go to bed once X got home. About a second later we received a text on the house group chat. Someone had been stabbed just outside the shop. I tried to call X but he wouldn't answer. Y was being totally complacent about the whole thing and wanted to stay out of it. I was deeply concerned. I ran to the shop, Z followed.

There was blood everywhere - more than I've seen in my entire life. Like something from TV. There was a man on the floor, almost dead. A crowd of people stood around and it seemed like they wanted to help, but X was one of the two people being even remotely helpful - he was on the phone to the ambulance and someone else was putting pressure on the wound. X said the ambulance said we should talk to him to keep him awake. I got beside him and got him talking. The boy next to me was skinny with small hands and was unable to put enough pressure on the wound. I must have asked four times for someone to help and no one did, until X stepped in.

X and I sat side by side, the man just in front of us, working as a team to help him survive. Initially, I was purely focussed on doing the job, and then around ten minutes in I realized that this man might die. I didn't let it affect my actions but it all felt surreal and it motivated me to do an even better job. Eventually, the police came and Z directed them to us. One spoke to X and another tried to locate the wound with my help. The ambulance was a few minutes behind them. When they arrived, the police thanked X and I for helping him and said we saved his life.

Once everyone left I started sobbing. Z tried to comfort me but the only person able to properly was X. Seeing him help that man made me remember why I loved him. We went for a long walk but when we got home, I felt so much anxiety about the whole thing on top of everything I'd felt from leaving X and being with him. All I wanted to do was forget everything and I slept with X. We both said ""I love you"".

The next day we both had coronavirus symptoms which meant we couldn't leave the house. Y and Z didn't so we could only really interact with each other. At the time government guidance said to stay indoors for a week if you have symptoms so we made the joint decision to escape reality for a few days and continue to share a bed, say ""I love you"", etc, whilst we helped each other through the illness

This didn't work because my symptoms became pretty severe. I thought, being young, it'd be like a flu, but mine were so bad that an ambulance was called on me one night. Throughout everything X was amazing. He stayed up all night with me waiting for the ambulance, and was more than happy to stay awake for me every night. He had exams but put me before them. He went to get me special medicine to help my symptoms. Through the whole thing I felt utterly helpless and I felt I couldn't get through it without him. His symptoms were quite bad but not as bad as mine, but they oscillated in severity over time, so there were times where I returned the favour for him.

During this time I faced backlash from friends who knew from Y and Z about us. One said I was using X and leading him on, and another said it was unfair that I'd called X abusive because 'clearly he isn't' from my behaviour following. I stand by my claims of X being abusive and I feel bad about going back but I was facing extraordinary circumstances and was one of the worst times in my life. The lack of support from friends pushed me further towards X who wasn't judging or accusing me.

We decided to wait until the symptoms cleared to talk. But then it got to a point where it had been a long enough time frame that it was no longer ""just a few days escaping reality"" but the new reality. Cutting it off would have been an active movement, and continuing as we were was passive. After a week, the symptoms became manageable, and then it was my birthday, and we celebrated that together.

Our symptoms cleared completely maybe three days ago and when this happened I booked a train home (for today). In total, I spent three weeks with him (after breaking up).

I was so blown away by the level of love I felt from him. I wanted nothing more than to go back to him. I feel like my entire future has changed and all the reasons for leaving I had before like needing to prioritize my career and mental health don't really apply now. I was so happy to be spending every day with my best friend and felt so lucky to be there.

I was trying to think of ways we could be together, but what I need is to see he's changed. I think he was on 'best-behaviour' because he was trying to win me back, and I think it was easier for him to play the hero when facing circumstances like this. This also isn't exactly out of character. When I'm down, he has always loved building me back up and showing me love, but it's when I'm live and well, expressing my own opinions and making my own decisions that he will abuse me if I've done something he doesn't like. A friend has said that X didn't exactly have much to do with his time so all the selfless gestures like baking me a birthday cake and going to the pharmacy for me also benefited him. Also, given how controlling X is, three weeks where I am entirely dependent on him, sexually available, emotionally available, and have no friends/life outside of him is, some could argue, his dream scenario. As cold as this seems, I tend to agree.

If I were to stay with him, I'd need him to admit to me everything he's done in full, acknowledge that change will be a long process, and find some abuse counselling to help change his behaviour. Conversely, he has stated (within these three weeks) that I've never been abused, has claimed to have changed basically overnight, and has credited his enhanced level of empathy and intelligence as the reason.

There were also red flags - he made a dig at me and tried to blame me for it (he argued with me for over an hour before admitting he was wrong), and then he did the same thing later when he was rude and condescending. This was one day out of 21 but given his history it's important to me that he's never even slightly abusive. There was also a point where he was trying to tell Y something about me that directly contradicted what I had just said, and then he told me I was wrong when I corrected him. He also told me a story about a couple he knows, and skimmed over the part of the story where the boyfriend broke the girlfriend's window purposely during an argument, as if it were no big deal. He told me another story about a girl he knew who was abused, and told her story on TV, and he thought she was in the wrong because lots of people know who her ex is. These actions don't strike me as those of a reformed abuser.

Everything else he did for me is amazing but it doesn't mean he won't abuse me again in the future. These bad actions are relatively minor in compariosn but are exactly the types of red flags I ignored when I started dating him.

I'm really struggling. I know that I need to end it (again) but I don't want to. I feel so in love with him and I want to believe in him so bad. I'm contemplating trying to push him towards abuse counselling. It does seem like there's a great deal of love there, so part of me thinks it might be possible.

domesticviolence,"Back in September, having changed schools, I met a girl that I'd only heard her name being passed around a few times in the past back then. Now, we are a small community here so basically every time two highschool kids form a relationship the word travels around really fast. And so did the story of my new friend and I knew about her boyfriend way before I met her. Everything I heard concerning him from my close friends gave the impression that he is a cool, calm and cheerful guy, someone you would wanna be friends with. He supposedly had a loving and wholesome relationship with her during summer of 2019, however, they had already been broken up for about a month before I got to meet her.

I got really close to her in no time, of course I would... She is such a kind and loving person, her empathy levels are up through the roof. As we got closer she slowly started opening up about the past, and, of course, us being teenagers, we discussed about her relationship with that boy I mentioned earlier. They broke up because they had been having frequent fights for stupid teenagers' stuff. As it turned out though, she was unhappy with this and somehow they both got convinced on retrying their relationship, so they were in the ""getting back together"" phase. No relationship yet, nothing serious, apparently they were just discussing it. She ended up flirting with another guy during that process and eventually she just made out with this new guy. Obviously he didn't like this, and very understandably but this is were all this stops being just a highschool drama and things get serious.

Because of her mistake, he had now had the perfect setting to manipulate her, gripping on this mistake and making sure she wouldn't forget it ever. Here's the thing... When I started getting close to her, was the time that he was hitting her up in order to meet her and multiple times had they gotten out and ended up having sex. The sick part is that when she was begging him to let the past be past and try again from the beginning, he was constantly refusing to get back with her while keeping up reminding her of how terrible of a person she is for ""cheating on him"".

After a while, where I was trying to help her with her situation, as the friend of hers I'd become by now, this was still happening. She was begging him to get back with her and forgive, he was refusing to, kept up bullying her for her mistake but also hitting her up and giving her hopes that they'd retry only to go out have sex and then disappear from her life for days. After this, I finally started getting her to realize that she was harming herself and that she should move on. Her being confident, next time he'd texted her to go out, she refused and she told him that she was finally ***moving on***...

From that point on, he got fixated on her but not in a good way. He kept promising her love, and that everything would go back as it was, only to make her let her guard down and go out with him, have sex again and then proceeding to crush her hopes telling her that she was a shitty person and he didn't wanna get back with her.

This situation has escalated for the past six months and having tried everything to stop her from going back to him,  I realized that, from a point forward, she'd started to deny the fact that he is using her and started willingly lying to herself, always denying facts and putting herself into the illusion that things would go back to as they were and that she could be happy with him. It wasn't until they had a fight where after he'd finished insulting and lowering her, he started love bombing her and showering her into affection, that I realized what this thing exactly was: ***an abuse cycle***.

For the past six months she has been used for sex, insulted by him, emotionally and verbally abused and threatened by him and yet she still lies to herself, denying the reality of the situation and she blames herself thinking that he is right to act this way because she had mistreated him. Earlier today she told me that I was trying to manipulate her into abandoning the love of her life, while also claiming she might commit suicide because of what she did. All this and he still keeps passing blame on her and claims that he did nothing wrong.

I seriously believe that she is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, developed during the constant experiencing of this cycle of abuse. She is 18, turning 19 in June. I would have tried to convince her to seek professional help but, she is still in school so she lives with her family, the financial situation of which is really difficult, she couldn't even dream of affording a psychologist. Also her parents are uneducated and conservative. The one time she tried asking for an appointment with a psychologist in the past for another reason, they told her that she didn't need one and that ""it's all in her head"".

I haven't told her my assumption yet but I believe she will deny it, of course. Every available info on the characterization of Stockholm Syndrome I was able to find, match the exact ""symptoms"" she is experiencing at the moment and the same goes for the assumption I made about their situation for the past six months being an abuse cycle.

He would also be there waiting for me to return from work, at which point I just waited in the apartment parking lot until he would leave (around midnight). On one of these visits, he took the lock off of my door making it impossible to lock him out. I told my landlord the next day, and the locks were changed immediately. But on that night, I lived in fear.

This happened about a month ago, and we are both 20 year old men. He is starting to contact my family saying that I owe him $700 for bills that are entirely in his name. If the harrassment continues I might have to take some action and get a restraing order.

What can I do to press charges? I have a much more detailed account of the assault and harrassment that I hand wrote after he stole my deadbolt lock.

My glasses are broken again and I'm basically back to being fucking blind, so I wouldn't be able to clean it up anyways. My body is battered beyond belief from multiple punches and especially my head. My lips are swollen and cracked, as well as the inside of my mouth sliced open in multiple places, from my teeth, from when he was trying to snap my neck. Or suffocate me, can't remember. I figured out I could breathe through my nose. Pretended to black out, so he'd feel powerful. I can still taste the metallic blood. I was going to kill myself. No matter how hard I apologized, I was ravaged with the worst verbal spewage he could muster, each a uniquely designed bullet to my self-esteem. Honestly, I took the knife he stabbed me with and sliced it across my body, but he stole it from me and rewarded me with a blow, hard to the side of the head. I was paralyzed for a second. The stupid, sick thing is that I almost thought he cared for a second, by the way he pulled it out of my hand. He doesn't. I know. Afterwards, I sat next to him, as he tore me apart. Quiet as a church mouse. Absorbing his words, like a sponge drenched in water. No matter how ridiculous and horrible, I have learned to keep my fucking mouth shut. It's just a game. I actually rested my head on him and held his hand, during it. The only comfort I will get out of him, it will only ever be physical. I feel like I am watching myself from outside of my body, when he attacks me sometimes. I see myself turn into this weak, malleable creature. I don't even know what the fuck I am doing when this is happening, I just fulfill the demand my brain tells my body to do. I'm pathetic and desperate.

Her husband, now deceased, was slowly losing his mind and invited these people to live in their second home last year, and now they've invited more people.  She suspects drugs are involved since they apparently only come out at night.  There is no legal contract. 
She called cops after an incident with a firearm but they hid it when the cops came.  She could not make it clear why, but the police told her she needed to give them 30 days notice before they have to leave.  That is in early April, and she fears they won't leave after that considering the current pandemic had closed many departments that would deal with something like this. I told her to get security cameras to film the theft but after that I'm not sure what to tell her to do.  She is scared for her life.  Additionally, she will not break the law in any way under any circumstances even if it would mean getting these people off her property.  Religious reasons.

domesticviolence,"Hi guys, I'm a first-time poster but lately been having trouble dealing with old/new issues in regards to my family and would appreciate a little TLC and advice (Please don't be fooled by my username)

Please be warned there is mention of drugs.

I'm a 22F and as of late (the last year or so) I've been really trying to heal and seek help in regards to my mental health. I've had trouble with my mental health for as long as I can remember and last year everything really hit me in the face and I decided I wanted to be better and that I deserve better.

Background (It's a long one sorry): I was born as a heroin dependable baby, meaning that I had to stay in the ICU for about 6 weeks or so, so the nurses could ""ween"" me off the drug. Ngl when my mum told me that (Only a few months ago) it broke my heart. My Grandparents had to give her money to support that habit to keep me alive. 

My Dad had passed away about 7-8 months before my birth from an overdose and then my mum meets my step-dad 8 months after having me so essentially I've viewed him as a dad and even called him dad. 

When I was young, myself and my 2 older siblings were court-ordered to be taken out of our mum's care and placed with a relative but we still were allowed to visit her on the weekends. I honestly lived for those weekends because I loved my mum so much and wanted to be with her. But then I ended up dreading them.

For a while, it would be me and my older brother going to visit her and then it just became me. My mother has suffered a lot, losing her soul-mate and then her kids and also struggling with her addiction and suffering from depression. I'm always on her side and try to be there for her.

My step-dad would consistently abuse, verbally and physically, my mum every time I came to visit and I heard everything and then he'd turn around and say it was my fault because I was sooking for my mum and that made him angry. Now that I'm older I understand he was just jealous that I was taking her attention.

I would hear her screams and him talking and telling her to shut up. I remember this one time, I couldn't have been older than 7, but I was following my mum back to her room and I was a few steps behind her. He was lying on the bed and as soon as she walked through the door he jumped and slammed the door in my face and she started to scream and asking for help and I ran back to my room. Another time she was off her face from methadone and she was eating a toast with peanut butter. It stuck to the side of her face and he was laughing and was telling me to go grab the camera and take photos so he could show it to her later. Every time she was off her face it would freak me out and scare me and I didn't want to be around her but I couldn't say no to him and did as he said.

I was exposed to this until I stopped visiting for weekends (I honestly couldn't tell you the age but it was somewhere around the start of high school) During high school my mum and step-dad decided to move 6 hours away but they were closer to my grandparent and my mums family. Should also say that my mum has 4 boys to him as well and every time she has said she was leaving him he would say 'You'll never see the boys again' and other sentences along that line.

There's only been 2 other times where I've heard him abuse her. 1st time was when I went to visit (I was about 19 or 20) and stayed in my little brother's room which was next to theirs and I woke up in the middle of the night to sobs and screams and the sound of him chocking her. Him saying to 'Keep crying and I'll give you something to cry about' I laid here frozen and crying and shaking not knowing what to do. I had my phone in my hand but was too scared to call the police. Eventually, it stopped and it took a while to fall asleep. 2nd time I again slept over in my brother's room and again was woken up by him abusing her but this time I was mad and angry and scared I got up went into the kitchen to grab a knife but then thought what the hell could I do? He could charge me for assault but honestly, at that moment I wanted to hurt him so badly. I kept my light on and the door opened a bit and heard him leave their bedroom and then said back to my mum 'You woke up Only\_Insults\_Pls' my mum asked how did he know, he said 'The fat C's lights are on' I pack my stuff and left and stayed at my grandparents. Since then I've never stayed over and I constantly feel guilty like what if I stayed and confronted him? Why can't I protect my mum?

To the most recent events, my little brother who is 15 calls me up saying my step-dad was picked up and taken to jail (for domestic violence) while our mum was off her face on pills and trashing the house. As soon as I heard him I knew he wasn't okay and he told me he was tired and asked if I could give him money for the bus to leave. I told him I was coming to get him and I'd see him soon. From where I live now and to where they live its a 7-hour drive but I didn't care I needed to get my brothers.

Halfway there my brother calls me and says my step-dad has made bail and needed a lift back home. I was reluctant but also knew he wouldn't let it go if I said no. So I picked him up and the whole time he was saying how the charge was for something was back in Jan and that mum has been trying to retract her statement but she can't because she's with the police as they're a witness. From what it sounded like he was trying to convince me that she made the whole thing up and my mums crazy.

My mum is a shell of who she was, which wasn't much. Even when she was off her face on pills her house was always clean. She has contradicted her self to me saying how she couldn't take it anymore and hope that the COVID-19 virus takes her to get out of the hell she is in and then she'll turn around saying she wouldn't take her life because she's strong (and she is) but he is such a parasite that I can see she's barely hanging on.

I don't know what to do at this point, I've given her resources and numbers to call to get out. I've told her every chance I can to leave him, take the boys and go but I'm met with half-hearted 'yeah'. I'm tired and I know I've done all I can but she calls me up telling me all the stuff he's done and how much she can't be around him and why won't he leave when he doesn't love her. I understand it's hard to get out of abuse like this when it's not only physical, verbal and mental but also with drug abuse too but at this point, I feel like the only way she'd be able to get out is if he ends up killing her or she kills herself. I don't want it to end like that because deep down I'm still that little girl who wants her mum to be happy and healthy and with me. I don't want to lose her too. I'm worried about my brothers and them growing up in the environment. My step-dad hasn't raised a had to them but is verbally and emotionally abusive to the 15-year-old, I want to get them out. I was even thinking of fostering them myself self but I don't have the financial means to do so and I want to give them everything.

This is causing me emotional and mental stress. As soon as I came home I stayed in my room and didn't eat for 24hrs or more because I just couldn't move I was pretty my frozen. Which is what a therapist has said that I do, I don't fly or flee I freeze.

Sorry for the long post.

domesticviolence,"Hi
I'm sorry I'm posting from a throwaway but I need privacy.
Today I feel like I lost it. It was just too much. I've being struggling with my mental disorders for a long time, today I was so distraught.
I have thoughts and obsession that are important but cause me to become suicidally depressed.
As an adult I am still living with my parents, I've got no job (on and off with job agencies), uni has been similar.
Then these things happen.
It happens randomly, sometimes three times a week, sometimes once a fortnight, you never know.
All my energy is put into my obsessions and problems.

My parents stormed into my room angry that I had used the spare bedroom and created a mess. I get it- my room and the spare bedroom is a mess. I can only say it's related to a lot of my phobias and it's a work in progress.
There was a lot of verbal and psychological abuse from both parents. A lifetime of it..and I snapped. I stood up for myself, told my dad to treat me like a daughter for once in his life.

I told my mum about my suicide attempts and struggle to get through the mental health system. She couldn't care less.
What she did have the energy for though was to go into room and verbally harass me repeatedly, while im on the phone with a counsellor.

All I wanted tonight was to nurse my cold and watch a 20 min episode of an anime. I haven't even been able to even finish the episode.
My dad mocked my cold. Last night I had to rescue the neighbour's cat from the tree outside my room, risking bites and scratches coz he can get aggressive. Anyway I very reluctantly enlisted by parents' help bc I couldn't help the cat on my own. You're perfectly fine, he says, otherwise you wouldn't have rescued the cat last night.
I am so done.
Iam emotionally broken. My mental illnesses aren't my worst enemy. *They* are.

What kind of sick psychos care more about orderliness and housekeeping than a person's life?
I would have left eons ago, but I'm not financially independent and my thoughts keep me here. ( Can get real delusional in there)

Sorry for this long post, but I just need some solidarity. Whenever these events happen I feel so devastated. Should I just say **** it and make a solid plan to get out once lockdown stops?
I really have felt hopeless tonight and I don't want to feel this way one more time.",Have had enough,throwaway24665,2020-03-31 10:00:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fsa939/have_had_enough/,7,1.0,13,3,417

I did call the cops and they arrested him, i came to my parents house and he got bailed out that same day. He gave me a whole story on how sorry he was on how being in jail made him realize that he messed up and blah blah blah. Well, I fell for it. A Criminal Protective Order was issued for 3 years, he must not harass me, take or break property, etc. Well, he did he would call me names, worthless, useless, bitch, a child(hes 12 years older than me), pathetic, idiot, etc. Well the incident happened in September and i found out I was pregnant in November. I went to Mexico for almost a month thinking maybe we just needed a break, well i came back and for a week he was nice. I thought wow okay stuff is changing and we will finally be happy. Well, I was wrong. His words started to get worse, his insults, he even raped me again while i kept saying my stomach was hurting(hes forced himself on me multiple times). Thats when I said enough. I packed my things and my daughters and waiting for him to leave so I can have my parents pick me up. If i called my parents when he was there it wouldve gotten ugly and my dad would've problem ended up in jail. Well, when I left he was harassing me non stop, if i didn't pick up he would leave voicemails calling me names, him raising his voice, calling me a child, ""suggesting"" i call him back and that I will never get rid of him, that he will always be in my life. He even threatened to take me to court for custody if i ""didnt act right"", which by that he means me disobey him. When I would start to stand up for my self he would say I'm a cocky bitch or a smart mouth bitch that he loved the old me, the one that wouldn't respond back and just took everything. I'm scared he will get custody and do something to the baby just to get back at me. He does has a temper and he actually lost custody of his other children but I'm scared the judge will think he's ""changed"" and he'll want to give him a chance since its a new kid.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôm hoping there are other people out there with similar experiences that can help. I am the youngest of 4 and the only girl; it goes: oldest brother, Andy (6 years older), second brother, Mike (3 years older), third brother who is the subject of this post, Austin (2 years older) and me (27F). 

I‚Äôve always been close with Andy and fairly close with Mike, but Austin and I had a horrible relationship growing up. I was told from a young age that Austin was born with unclassified learning disabilities, while the rest of us weren‚Äôt. Austin physically looked different - he had a larger forehead, a different shaped mouth and smaller eyes that didn‚Äôt track together - was slower to process information, and had a significant speech impediment (of which traces remain even after decades of speech therapy). He was bullied a lot when we were kids, and while I had lots of friends in the neighborhood, most of the kids didn‚Äôt want to play with him.

He wasn‚Äôt very coordinated, but he was strong as an ox, so much so that even my older two brothers were scared of him. But he pretty much only ever went after me. The first incident I remember, I was 2 or 3. He got mad during a pillow fight and shoved my face into the sharp wooden frame of my bed. I had to get 6 stitches. He got a little smarter about it as we got older, but I often had to wear long sleeves, long pants and turtlenecks to cover up the cuts and bruises, and spent hours locked in our upstairs bathroom, because it was the only door that locked.

My parents avoided it as much as possible. They told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about the violence with other people, that it was a family matter. And they constantly reminded me it wasn‚Äôt his fault - he wasn‚Äôt in control of his anger, and it was pure luck that I hadn‚Äôt ended up that way.

I eventually stopped the abuse myself when I was teen. After he choked me until I almost blacked out, I realized he meant it when he told me he was going to kill me, and I began training in the middle of the night - using my dad‚Äôs weights to weight lift, running laps around our yard, doing push-ups and sit ups. At the same time, Austin, who had always been somewhat fat, went through an anorexic phase. I got stronger than him and put an end to it. I left for college as soon as I could and have been independent ever since.

Over the years, I stopped hating Austin. I understood his life had been hard, and when we were in our early twenties, he finally got himself help (our parents had never let him see a psychiatrist because they thought only weak people couldn‚Äôt handle their own mental health problems) and tried to make amends. I forgave him, but we have never been close, though he has tried. Recently I discovered he never had ‚Äúunclassified learning disabilities.‚Äù He has fetal alcohol syndrome. My parents drank heavily while mom was pregnant with him. It wasn‚Äôt an act of chance or God - they did this to him, and while me and my oldest brothers are all successful, he has floundered his whole life for something that was their fault.

It gives me a new perspective, and while I‚Äôll never forget what happened as a kid, I do believe he‚Äôs changed and doing his best, and he deserves to have family. But it‚Äôs hard for me and I have no idea how to develop a relationship after everything that happened. Any advice is welcome.

tldr I was physically abused for years by my older brother that I was told had learning disabilities. He changed, but I‚Äôve never been able to develop a good relationship with him, despite his efforts. Recently found out he has FAS, which likely contributed to his behavior, and I want to provide him with better family support.

domesticviolence,"TW: Domestic abuse, violence

I am not going to lie, times are rough. Two weeks into quarantine, three weeks after I broke up with my ex and moved back to my parents house with most of my personal belongings broken by him. But at least I'm alive.

This one time though, I thought I was not going to make it. It was the day of the World Cup, we celebrated the football game and drank a bit. Then something changed in his eyes. He started to talk nonsense. Then he threatened me. I ran to my apartment and he followed me. He hit me once, broke a glass, and I managed to run up the stairs and lock myself inside my apartment. Then the nightmare began. He forced the door, choke me, threatened to rape me, hit me again. For hours I cried, yelled, I was out of breathe. I finally managed to run to the window and shout to my neighbours to call the Police, which they did. 
The Police came, and took him. The next morning they took my deposition, and he denied everything, which hurt a bit more. I was not emotionally ready to press charges, so I did not. I was in love, so I forgave him. But deep inside something was broken. I don't expect anybody to understand why I stayed with him after that. I don't understand it either. 

But now it's over for good, and almost two years later I can finally move on. i can tell myself: never again do I have to undergo such situation. Never again do I have to forgive such an act. Never again do I need to find excuses for someone who hurt me.

When we do I'll be buying it. Today he told me he needs $15 for a game. I said yes. Then he changed it to $20 and said he will give me $15 back on cash. I said no as cash is useless to me rn due to corona and I need money on my card as I owe 2 weeks rent for landlord. I told him this. I then cooked us dinner. I asked him just wash a bowl. He said no he doesn't have to as I didn't give him money for a game. Then he ate all the food. I had none, and he told me to not cry to him and that it's not a big deal.

domesticviolence,"We had another fight and he was still refusing to take responsibility for the most serious stuff. 

But of course, afterwards, he keeps hovering around me, checking on me, trying to reaffirm his ""love"" for me, trying to do things for me, trying to be on his best behavior. He's trying to rope me back in and I hate it. Let me breathe! Back off!!! Leave me alone!

Its just creepy how he's always keeping tabs on me and asking if I need anything or if there's anything I want him to do. If only he had been so eager to help this much when I really needed his help, instead of getting angry at me for asking. 

He tried apologizing last night. I just cried and wouldn't look at him or say anything. I wish he would have just let it go and walked away but he kept trying to apologize when I clearly wasn't in the mood to talk. He kept trying to get me to forgive him.

 I'm glad I didnt respond to him. He may be apologizing for things in general, but he keeps refusing to take responsibility for specific things. He's still justifying and denying and defending. 

Sorry, buddy, but you can't be that sorry or willing to change if you can't take full responsibility for everything. We're not playing this game on your terms anymore. You dont get to dismiss the most serious things but ""apologize"" for other things.

domesticviolence,"A friend, we'll call her M, left her boyfriend yesterday. It's not the first time its happened, but is my first time involved in the situation. Apparently he wanted her out of the house before the end of the day or he was going to beat her. For her safety, I decided to help her blitz move to her mom's, who had agreed and rented a Uhaul before I arrived.

M is financially dependent on the bf. She  states that he physically and verbally threatens her in front of her 3 yr old child who she has 50/50 custody with her ex. The bf however has not harmed the child although I dont know how true this is.Thankfully, her son is with his father this weekend. 

Apparently her bf is still sending her threatening text messages about money and degrading comments. She is quick tempered and I know she adds to the fuel when they argue. She is opposed to a restraining order and frankly, I'm afraid she's going to go back to him if we don't have a solid plan in place. I have repeatedy told her to stop talking to him and block him.

I think we did the most important part by removing her out of the house and somewhere safe for now. M and her mom don't have the best relationship, and the repeat cycle of returning to her abuser needs to stop. I have been a voice of reason to M and I need some guide to make sure M understands the severity of her situation so that this is not sabotaged.

I know she's going to need to put some kind of plan put together, but I don't know how to lay it out with her. With a mandatory state stay at home order, I think it's going to be difficult. Her reluctance to seek help will undermine the move and I think she thinks it's out of her control to help herself.

domesticviolence,"
Hello there. This is a throwaway account. 

I kind of just wanted to ask for your opinion on this since I‚Äôm not sure if what I have experienced counts as domestic abuse since it isn‚Äôt too dramatic and probably not as horrible compared to what others have experienced. 

Someone I‚Äôve lived with has a really bad temper. He would usually put the blame on me if he did something wrong/forgot something etc, he couldn‚Äôt deal with it in his head - lash out and then punch me in the arm, chest area, not too bad but I got bruises from it. I don‚Äôt think he was aware of what he was doing I guess he just doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with it in his head. I‚Äôm taking care of most of the household, since I‚Äôm still in education, whenever something goes wrong like I didn‚Äôt put enough softener in the laundry etc. he makes me feel like I‚Äôm inept. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being whiny right now, it‚Äôs just making me really sad. Anyway, the punching has stopped mostly, it kind of shifted to just telling me I‚Äôm useless/inept/etc. without touching me physically. I usually then say do you really think that and he just says oh I‚Äôm just joking, why do you not understand my jokes, which makes me feel even worse about it. 

Would you say this is abuse? Am I just too sensitive here? I honestly don‚Äôt know since I‚Äôve never had lots of close relationships with people. Am I the one who‚Äôs making the mistakes here? I really do not know.",Can this be classified as domestic abuse/physical violence?,annamalika,2020-03-27 14:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fpy7nh/can_this_be_classified_as_domestic_abusephysical/,13,0.95,16,8,267
domesticviolence,"Last night my girlfriend (17) got into a fight over a small problem and it escalated to her being hit my her mother and having to run from her home.   Her phone is broken and stuff is with her parents. I have pictures of marks, her neighbors witnessed it, and I have screenshots of messages from her brother. She refuses to get police or cps involved. Her parents are extremely manipulative and are holding her college money, car, and whatever else they can over her. She needs to commit to a college by April 1st. She can stay with my family or has a friend but her parents are using quarantine to try and get her home tonight, saying that if she stays somewhere else she is not welcome back because of it. The only exception right now is if her mom enters my family‚Äôs property we will call the police. I also gave her a small thing of pepper spray I keep in my car in case she is attacked again. Not sure if that‚Äôs a good idea. 

I am worried for her and her younger siblings safety I feel if any case can be made legally it could at least help her siblings. She turns 18 in about a month.

Any help would be appreciated I have never dealt with this before. My goal right now is to gather evidence.

The police have been coming to my house every few days for weeks (I‚Äôm never home when they do) And they‚Äôve been leaving little notes on my door asking to call them about the subpoena. Which I did literally over 10 times and I‚Äôve left 3 messages. I never got a call back and they keep coming to my house. I asked them in the voicemail to please stop coming to my house and that I would pick it up myself. They don‚Äôt listen and they never call me back but today they left a rude ass note on my door saying they were done playing phone tag and to tell them at what time I would be home in the morning. Now I‚Äôm completely turned off... I‚Äôm literally the victim in the situation they‚Äôre acting like I have a warrant out for my arrest. And the court date isn‚Äôt for another 6 months... also it‚Äôs embarrassing I live in an upscale building I don‚Äôt necessarily want the police knocking on my door every other day!!!!

domesticviolence,"It finally occurred to me that perhaps I should mention some of this stuff to my dad. I told him a lot of the worst of it, including about my husband talking a lot about killing us. I had hoped that maybe my dad would offer some kind of help. Nope, certainly not my dad.

His response was that family seems to be a stressor for my husband and that we need counseling asap. He expressed a lot of concern for my husband and merely told me that if I felt in danger that I should take the help offered (by the dv organization). 

Gee, thanks, dad. 

There's a reason why it never occurred to me to talk to my dad sooner. He has consistently failed me throughout my life and has only had a negative impact on me. 

I've decided to pose the separation as a positive thing for my husband so that he's more likely to agree to it. If he doesn't agree, then I'll take the kids and run because I will have no other option and he keeps talking every single day about getting a gun. I'm not sticking around for that.

domesticviolence,"His abuse is not just physical and psychological, he abuses me by social disconnection. I guess he feels shame and realizes in small corner of his mind how monstruos he behaves so he simply cut me off. His mom didn't see me for last two years. He blame me yet he knew that I would not go after his abuse because I can't speak with this woman looking her into her eyes and omit the fact how awful her son is, especially because she endures abuse from him, and her husband, too.

He cut me off from some people in his life by spreading lies about how I'm mentally ill. My mom is schizophrenic and I've made a mistake when I confessed that to him in beginning of our relationship. Now he regularly hits in a weak spot by telling me that I'm crazy, that I hear voices. His friend looked at me with some mix of fear, disgust and aleterness the last time he spoke to me, and the last time when he was here, on the birthday of our kid, he didn't say a thing to me. 

I made a cake for our apartment owner, I don't know right term how you call people from who you rent an apartment. She has my phone nb but she decided to reply to him about my cake. He didn't bother to transfer what she said.

Finally, he has a neighboor with whom he is close, she is sexually attractive and flirts with him for I don't know how long, they know each other three years while our own relationship only degraded further in that time, and between them two grew.

I found his messages to her. They are sexual teasings:

*Him: Hi, how is it going?

She: Good. I don't know what to prepare for lunch today. I don't have cigarettes. 

She: How are the kids?

Him: They are in grandma backyard, clap-clap [as approval]. Make a soup. It's healthy.

She: Is it not dangerous to bring kids to grandma now? She is old. [covid19]

Him: don't ... [as in don't bother me]

She: okay, I won't

She: I saw your wife outdoor with kids.

Him: She can go to school yard few steps away but she won't go with them in a walk around block.

She: At least she went out :laughing to tears smiley:

She: What book are you reading?

Him: I'm reading Bukowski, he is fucking a lot, he writes short but witty.

She: all you think about is fucking, poor Noahloahboah :laughing smiley:

Him: please, don't

She: clap clap :three laughing to tears smileys: [this completely changes its earlier meaning more towards slap-slap, as in slap from behind in sex]

Him: children playground at noon? [with kids]

She: no, i'm afraid of covid19 and kid is sleeping.

Him: covid19 party

She: hahha*

If she teases him and provoces responses that much in text messages I can expect, now that I've seen, what she does in person. She constantly triggers sexual associations. Their whole interaction comes to that because I've noticed he doesn't know some common information that people who hang that much would knew about. I guess they solely speak in sexual conotations and poke each other.

I was crushed emotionally when I read that. I was hurt and mad. And I annoyed him about him mocking me with her, referring to incident in Feb, when she took visit to our home, for kids to play, and she said to me, again as a sexual insinuation, after being curious about how we met and I said it was food that joined us:
- So, you like pizza (which is another meaning for pussy in our language)? Here she starts giggling, laughing for several minutes.
He comes, stands in fron of her, and claps to her with his hands, giving her appraisal for the ""excellent joke"" and calls her with specific name people use here when you pown someone. She continues laughing. 

Later in kitchen, she told him ""Something is boiling down here."" referring to oven, but with extended laughing it again switches to sexual implication, because it has double meaning in our language.

Lastly, she asks me whether we as a family would come to her place next time, I reply with ""See this with him"", and she goes playfully to him, and says: ""Your wife said I should ask you to agree for a play"", and again extended giggling and laughing. She acts as a horny teenager. I remember when all my collegues were capable to talk about in high school were just such jokes. And the ones who were more into it were actually signalizing they are more than ready to have sex. I also doubt she has some insecurities is she feels a need to slam someone she barely knows. Last thing is, he says about her that she knows everyone in neighborhood. If that's true she must have heard thst he is an abuser. Why is she that interested in him then?

I complained these days a lot and poked him, and I bite, and I cried. He was defending himself with ""It's not your business."" and tons of insults, and at rare moments with ""There's nothing between me and that woman."", ""We never met together."". He said that this how they speak and how them two speak with me is a completely normal discussion and why haven't I met someone and invited. I wanted to invite my school friends ten ten years ago but I decided I don't want them to meet him because he would probably be rude, and they would understand he is an asshole. I don't like type of people he likes. He would not socialize nor accept people I do.

A day after my birthday he could not handle all these accussations well, after he found me smoking a cigarette [on a window] and crying at 3 am, after which he threw up in toilet for next 20 minutes at 4 am [since he drinks alcohol daily] and then when I wanted to take dogs in a walk he stopped me, he said he will. I took water and a wiper and got myself to clean floor. Here he comes 15 minutes later and tells ne he will wipe the floor and that I should go with dogs. Or whatever I want from that two. I said I'll go with dogs, and later take kids and he can lie down as a lazy ass. Here he goes mad. Tells me that I should not take kids in a walk anymore. That hurt me since I read his messages where his emotional affair partner mocks me. I go mad and reffer all back to her. He got down on me, hit me in my back, legs, punched me with his fist right into middle of my chest, hit me on my head several times, broke my eardrum [I hope it's only that since I don't hear now on right ear well].

With people with whom he doesn't speak, our building, he expresses some even fearfull reactions. Like, when he discovered that our first neighboor talks about his abusiveness around to people. He immediately told me that I can choose between him or her, and if I choose her he will be my enemy. As if he is not now.

Our second neighboor gave clothes to our kid. Handed it to him. I wanted to knock down on the doors and thank for it and give back piece of barbie doll clothes that stuck with clothes. He freaked out.

Third neighbors he cut off due to giving beer to their three year old, allegedly. I'm not sure about that because they seem normal, and the woman is a teacher. I suspect they've told him something about him abusing me and maybe he just doesn't want to be ashamed further.

Our other neighboor had fire in his apartment but he seems as a good person. My partner talked shit about him.

A woman who works in fast food near us, came to our apartment once, was nice with me, always said hello. He talked shit about her, too.

Lastly, a guy who comes from place where my partner's mom comes, doesn't even greet me when he sees me.

Finally, he locked down his phone, not telling me a slight sense about where has he been with kids, I'm excluded and cut of from his mind and life as a cancer. He is just keeping me here while kids are too young.

This is toxic environment. He is narciss, psychopat, sociopath, abuser. I want to leave and I can't. I'm broke. We are all in middle of this covid19 crisis. I don't know how to deal with this shit in front me. I endured his abusiveness somehow till the point that he is wide openly jerking on a woman that lives in next building. For three years. He thinks he doesn't have anything with her just because he didn't stick his dick yet, although he did that thousands of times already in his mind, probably every time we had sex together.

I'm weak, broken, ashamed, slamed to the bottom.

So lately he has been talking about buying a knife and saying he needs it for ""self defense"" due to our neighbour yelling at him weeks ago. 
He said he will then stab him as soon as he sees him and that it will be fine as that's ""self defense"". Today he said he wants to buy a gun as people will turn crazy during the corona stuff and try to rob him, etc. He's talking about using his next payments on it. Those are his words. I feel like he's using this as an excuse to get a weapon. Am I wrong for thinking that? Also it's not legal here in Aus but that's not going to stop him. He has also recently said to me during another conversation that if he sees me with another guy ""I will kill both of you."" Then laughed.

domesticviolence,"Um I don‚Äôt know if pulling hair is real violence but he‚Äôs started to pull me by my hair to get me to face him and pay attention to him. 

He thinks because I‚Äôm not looking at him that I‚Äôm not listening to what he‚Äôs saying so he does that to get me to listen to him apparently. He‚Äôll hold my head still by my hair forcing me to look up at him the whole time he‚Äôs talking and it just feels kind of humiliating I guess ? It also hurts because he‚Äôs not just tugging my hair he‚Äôs pulling it down on purpose. 


Another thing he‚Äôs started doing which I would say is kind of violence is he knees me in the lower back while I‚Äôm sleeping ? I know this sounds strange but he rams his kneecap right into my spine on my lower back. Usually when I‚Äôm asleep and when I wake up and try to move away he‚Äôll hold me still and do it again. He claims he does it in his sleep and can‚Äôt help it but I can tell he‚Äôs awake and sometimes when I ask him to stop he‚Äôll reply ‚Äòshut up‚Äô so I know he‚Äôs awake. 

I‚Äôve many bruises on my lower back he‚Äôs done this many times. 

So yeah not really sure what to do about it. I have a very bad feeling like something would happen if I tried to leave him ? 

Also can‚Äôt really call police can I ? They‚Äôre not gonna do anything if all he‚Äôs doing is pulling my hair and kneeing me in my sleep?

domesticviolence,"**Update**: Thanks to you - [**I made it**](https://youtu.be/76F_Tv16uWg)! 

Thanks so much for your support/.  
Long story short: I was emotionally, psychologically and sexually abused (meaning - **I was raped**) by my ex partner for 3 years. Apart from many things he took from me when I finally left (1.5 year ago), he also deleted me from our YouTube account, which was basically about me (climbing, healthy life style etc) and made a story full of lies for 40k people. The story was about me ofc.

It broke me down. Literally. I couldn't stop crying after what I saw (it also included the death of my dog...). Many people who I know believed him... It made me so sad/mad. **So I decided to analyse my relationship and put it on paper.** English is not my first language, but tbh, I write pretty good.  Some of my friends read it and **encouraged me to make a video**, as I am a video maker.

I want to do that, as it's teaching how to recognise the abuse, why abuser is an abuser and why victims can't / don't leave. It took me two months to write it. I'm confident it's good.

But then...**what if the video will get very little views. For me it sounds like it would be another victory for the abuser.**

I know that video will be so soo good for many women (and men). It will open many eyes. But yet, there is a sot of fear, that man, who abused me will win again.

What do you think? Just in general.Any type of **ass kicking towards my direction how to be a boss-bitch, or advises to simply not think of that bastard - are very welcome.**

domesticviolence,"He gave me info for DV counselors in my area which he strongly urged me to talk to. I wasn't sure about taking any legal action yet, if any is possible. I think he mentioned something about filing a report if i wanted but I can't remember what he said because I think i disassociated at that point. Mental overload. I can't wrap my mind around the reality of this situation. 

 I want my husband out of the house before taking any legal action and to leave peacefully so he doesn't traumatize the kids with any drama. 

Trying to leave would be nearly impossible with him home 24/7. We've talked about getting counseling and I was hoping to tell one of them to suggest a ""temporary"" separation. If it was suggested as a positive thing as if to restore the marriage, then he could pack up peacefully and leave on his own. 

Since this is not our house, he would have no legal right to return and the owner (who also lives here) could tell him that he would be arrested if he comes back on this property because of trespassing. 

Even though he would know where we live, at least he wouldn't be legally allowed back on the property and we could call the cops if he showed up. 

And if he was moved out but found out or came to realize that there is no restoring the relationship, if he flips out, I can always take the kids and hide for a while. 

The problem is that I have been having trouble getting into contact with a counselor who could work with me on this. I've thought about not waiting for one and just going ahead and trying to suggest a separation myself but I have not been able to think about how to even bring it up. I feel stuck.

domesticviolence,"Tl;dr: What does one (in the US) do about a physically and mentally abusive parent, when calling the police or social services would likely result in a sibling being extracted from the home due to poor living conditions?

My girlfriend of several months had a very unconventional home situation, with an abusive mother and a negligent father. She was fortunate enough to move out to college where I met her, but she's still tried to maintain her ties with her family, especially because her sister (13) is still living with her parents.

Little over a week ago, our college announced that we would be getting sent home for an indefinite amount of time. It's become natural for her to come home with me over breaks, despite my house being inconveniently far from her house as well as from our college, so that's what she did and she stayed over for a week. Once rumors began spreading of a lockdown going into place in Pennsylvania, my parents decided that it would be a good time for me to take her home, and to an extent I agreed. She had tolerated being home the last few times that she was there, and she considers it important to spend time with her father and sister, so initially I didn't feel like taking her home meant I was intentionally dropping her off at the gates of hell.

An hour into my 3 hour drive back home, I got a text from my girlfriend asking if I could turn around and take her back with me. My parents remained firm in that they aren't prepared or willing to allow her to stay for an extended amount of time, so I guiltily continued my drive home. At that point, her mother had already begun being rude to her, swearing and demanding that she do things around the house that her mother should be capable of doing herself. Then, later that night, my girlfriend tried to intervene when her mother was berating her younger sister for (again) not meeting her needless demands. Instead of resorting to violence on her sister as her mother normally would at that point, her mother began to shout at her and hit her for ""trying to tell the parent how to parent"". After my girlfriend got away to check on her sister, her mother than began to go after her father, shouting at him and hitting him (for being the parent of she who tells the parent how to parent, I guess), and he resorted to walking out of the house and down the road, alone and in the dark. Since it had already reached that point on my girlfriend's first night home, she immediately reached out to find somewhere else to stay, and is now staying with a friend nearby.

This is only one example of what happens in the house, whether my girlfriend is there or not, and all of the aggression and violence stems from her mother. No one in the house feels safe because of her, and she routinely takes money out of the father's bank account and then runs off and spends it with other men, even though their income is barely liveable as it is.

Judging from all this, you'd think any of them would've seen it fit to call the police. The reason they don't feel they can is that their house is absolutely filled and cluttered with the mother's things to a hoarding extent. They fear that any intervening officials would deem the house unfit for the sister to live in, and that she would be lost to the system.

I've already lost one friend to the system for invalid reasons on behalf of CYS, and so personally I don't think involving authorities is worth the risk of my girlfriend losing her sister to the same system. So my question is, are there other actions that anyone in the house can take to have the mother removed/preventing from causing harm?","Tried to bring my girlfriend (F19) to her home before any sort of lockdown begins, abuse resumed the night I left her there",nmans01,2020-03-23 05:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fnei1h/tried_to_bring_my_girlfriend_f19_to_her_home/,3,0.95,16,23,660

domesticviolence,"My mother (45) and my father (46) have been together for over 20 years, but got married 4 years ago. Shortly after I (18) was born, my mother and I moved away from my country in order for her to work and support the three of us. From as early as I can remember, they've argued every time we visited, mostly because of my father's prolific and continuous cheating, but they always patched things up until the next time.

My two siblings F(9) and M(6) were born, my mother and I eventually moved back home, they all moved away again and they finally got married after all those years. I moved away to an aunt for better high school opportunities, and the physical abuse began, in addition to the severe verbal and emotional abuse. It started with him hitting her in the face to shut her up, and has progressed to her being hit all over her body with several different household items from air freshener cans to knives to alcohol bottles, to choking and other forms of bodily torture. To add insult to injury, my father went and had an outside child one year ago. Bear in mind my mother has helped him in every facet of his life since they met, and this is what she gets. He's even said she deserves it and has cut me off since being confronted by me.

Because I'm still away at university, I have no means of helping to protect my siblings and my mom. So, the onslaught continues, and everyday I wait for the call with my mother sobbing at the latest mistreatment, powerless to make a change. He does this in the name of 'protecting the children' that he doesn't feed, take care of or financially support, and that are afraid of him. He refuses to leave where they live for the same reason. He uses threats and manipulations to get the responses he wants out of her, and she can't fight back because he is significantly larger than she is.

He says all kinds of vile things about her at their work that aren't true, and is just a monster overall. Mom has attempted to get help from pastors, but she can't go to the police or they'll both lose their jobs and the kids will go to CPS. The abuse is even worse with the COVID-19 lockdowns.

I need advice for her and the children, I genuinely fear for their lives every day, and my heart splinters and shatters when I think about all my siblings have seen and experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents hate each other, but none of them are willing  to file for divorce nor leave the house. They have heated arguments which include insults and threats every single day over stupid things. My mom can't leave as she doesn't have a job and, on top of everything, my 8 year-old brother had been diagnosed with ADHD and a maturational delay before everything started to get worse between them. He's on meds and ocupational therapy, which doesn't seem to help at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to all of this, my 18 year-old brother is very impulsive and violent. His personality clashes with my dad's most of the time, resulting in them punching each other. After one of this fights, brother had a black eye for a week. He's been fired from two jobs already, and doesn't want to study anything, so he's at home most of the time doing absolutely nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Little brother's situation isn't getting better, in fact, it's only getting worse and his diagnosis isn't very promising. He's also impulsive, violent and very demanding. Not only that, but he's also a very big boy. I'm honestly scared for my mom, she's emotionally weak, fragile and suffers from untreated paranoia.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy is not an option, they are against it. I've told them many times they had to get therapy, not only for them but for my little brother as well to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the worst things of this whole situation is that they pretend to be the perfect family outside, but even that  facade falls down when they get angry, as they start yelling and don't care whether they are in public or not.

Today my parents got into an argument once again, but this time my dad got drunk during lunch, which was odd because he hardly ever drinks that much, and insulted my 18 year-old brother in front of my little brother. Mom had to take his bottle of wine away to prevent him from drinking more, to which he got mad and started insulting all of us as well. He couldn't even stand properly. 



Luckily for me, I moved in with my boyfriend recently so I'm not living with them anymore. Perhaps I should've stayed for my mom, if something happens to her I'd feel guilty and I'm not sure I could forgive myself for leaving.

We got married, and I moved to his duty station across the country from my family. I found out he had been seeing prostitutes and talking to girls on dating apps WHILE i was pregnant. He claims the only time he had sex with a prostitute is when I was 36 weeks pregnant, in the hospital being induced with HELLP syndrome. The abuse started verbally, but quickly escalated to physical intimidation, then pushing, then throwing ‚Äúfake punches‚Äù (purposely missing me), then to real punches but never my face, and finally this last week, he drove me to the middle of nowhere without my phone and beat me until I was bruised all over and had cuts on my face.

I don't exactly have the best parents . Being stabbed two times, gotten regular beaten up by a broken alcohol bottle , got my head smashed into marble , thrown off into marble stairs and getting kicked with the knee in my stomach and rib cage is almost a daily occurance my whole life.

Did I mention I am 16? 

I have been pretty much been in hell my whole life . 
Getting my hands dunked into super hot batter if I even tried to cook cause ""boys don't cook"" , and slapped on my back with a red hot iron spatula cause I didn't complete some task they gave me , has been a common occurrence of my life. 

I have grown ok and accustomed to amounts violence , fuckery , blood and tourture even military officers would be scared off. 

Now , if you are going to try to help me run away ,or do anything to better my situation , just don't waste your time , I live in India , and my Dad is an high ranking police officer , I have tried to run away or seek betterment of life eversince I was 13 . Shit don't work that way here.  And even if by some miracle I was seperated from my Psychophatic family , I would die before I am admitted to the Indian orgpanage system . It's literally slavery . 67% of all kids admited in it go ""missing""( are sold for 200-500 ruppes ,or 2.5 - 6.4 USDs) , never even getting a case registered for their ""disappearace"" , just , staying part of a statistic some(about 20-40%) Indian families are proud to hear because "" these children must have been abonden by God cause they are a weight on society , atleast someone is making them work"" .

My backstory aside....here is where....Idk..... atleast think there might be still a little scope of help. 

My annual class 11 exam marks are coming out in about a weak.  I am actually quite a good student. Being part of the ""intellectuals"" of the class . I have scored good relatively to the class this time. I am fifth in my class of 26 . 

The Problem is.......... it's good. But just not good ENOUGH.  My parents had warned me of consiquences if I didn't score very high per subject . They frankly can't give a shit if I am fith highest in class, or even if , relatively, I have been improving my grades. They wanted a certain amount of marks . They warned me of consiquences. I couldn't deliver that high. Now....I am afraid. Of the consiquences. 

I am having anxiety and panic attacks every few. Hours . 

The last time they gave such an ultimatum , and I failed to deliver , I got stabbed . These people don't give ultimatums without meaning them . I..... just don't know what I will face now. 

It would a big *BIG* help , if any of you can help deal with my panic and anxiety attacks . That alone would make this post wholly worth it. 

But.....any other kind of help....is appreciated too.

I have picked up everything and moved to another state to start my life over but never with a son. My baby boy is my world and I want to do right by him. What do I do?  Any suggestions where I can live that has reduced child care, good schools and resources for single mothers. Obviously I have no one. The abuse has gotten way worse. He comes in the room just to pick fights. Even if it was a good day. I get sick to my stomach hearing him come up the stairs. I am lonely. I miss true friendship, truly being in love and as pathetic as this sounds. Touch by someone who loves unconditionally. Living touch not touch meant to hurt you like choking, pushing etc. I want someone who can tell me something about me and who never talks over me.",Used.,deedee705,2020-03-22 19:47:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fn5ucs/used/,1,1.0,2,1,488

domesticviolence,"I am 25F, and my boyfriend of two years has been abusive for the last year. At first a slap which broke him up for days and days on end. He truly regretted it, and was upset saying I did not deserve a hand laid on me like that and he was sorry. Well, it progressively grew from that. As the abuse got more intense and violent, his regret just started to disappear. It would show after when he returned to earth, and would show in anger at himself and pure distraught at himself. Not so much for me, which he was always sorry for after, but he hated himself for turning out like this. 

We are two very explosive people, with pasts neither of us are proud of. The difference was that he was super open about it, and I wasn‚Äôt. I lied and lied, and trickle truthed about things. There was truth in lies and lies in truth. In the end everything came out - absolutely everything. 

Even when we were seeing each other at first we were wrong. He was trying to break it off with his ex girlfriend (which I understand relationships can overlap when you meet someone special to you), and at one stage had fully gotten back with her, I seen this on social media, and I for the first time hooked up with someone from Tinder, and I felt disgusting about it. It was all to spite him and not care but it didn‚Äôt work, I just felt small and pathetic and that it solidified how much I cared. 

But I had made a drunken mistake of sleeping with someone. Yes I had made the choice but I did it and I woke up thinking ‚Äòfuck this isn‚Äôt what I want to be, and i don‚Äôt want to do this to him - he‚Äôs worth so much more!‚Äô

Basically I had messed up at the beginning because of how messy it had been for him to have a gf and go back and forth between me and her, and I reacted in a way I didn‚Äôt want to. I didn‚Äôt actually want to hurt him just because he hurt me, but that was too late. And I made a mistake, and I felt wrong. 

But back to the title of this post. His friend was over in his home tonight and they were having drinks, catching up, etc. Me and him were texting the whole time - as we have both been doing only the right thing for each other the last 2 months. No abuse, no nothing. We have been good, apart from a few normal and healthy relationship arguments. 

He starts to hurl abuse at me though over text while I‚Äôm asleep. I wake up and foolishly bite in, when I should ignore it and sleep. He is drunk and he doesn‚Äôt mean it 99% of the time. But I do bite, and he sends me screenshots of girls he is sexting while he was texting me how much he loves me and misses me and in that night before the shit, I was like wow I really do love this man, and he needed to be shown openness and love from me because I hurt him. He isn‚Äôt that horrible abuser. 

Worse. He is an abuser and a cheater. He has slept with 11 other women just in the last year. He has been texting women while I‚Äôm with him and while I‚Äôm not. Scornfully he told me ‚Äúyou should have been the one looking at my phone, at my texts. You should have looked at my deleted media, you have seen I was recording having sex with all of these girls.‚Äù

I am shocked beyond belief. This happened at about 1:30am and it is now 8:25am. I haven‚Äôt cried and I haven‚Äôt slept. I feel sick, and I just want death to take me right now. 

Despite the two of us being volatile and hot headed, we have both been taking huge steps to not be that to each other. And it has been working brilliantly. But now that nice relationship that we both so much wanted, or I thought both of us, has ended in him sexting and banging other women.

There is a lot more for a two year relationship. I could probably write a full length novel if I wanted to, about the ups and downs of our relationship and of us as individuals. The part that is killing me right now is that it had fully stopped and he was being the best friend and partner, and he‚Äôs just self-sabotaged it and what could have been one of the greatest partnerships.

domesticviolence,"Well this is an update from my previous posts: things have gotten worse, like I mean WAY worse.

She's resorted to making rather snide remarks, which I feel she knows annoys the crap out of me, hence why she does it. She constantly watches me whilst I eat and makes like these little clicks with her mouth shaking her head etc .. really bloody annoying! Her M.O I believe, is to try and incite a fight by saying some stuff which annoys the crap out of me looking for a fight. And when she gets a response she's constantly at me and at me ... it's like please .... SHUT THE HECK UP!!!

To that end I have considered typing her an email, explaining exactly what I think, how I feel, in the fact that I feel she's only doing this because of my adoption all those years ago, she wanted to continue the abuse that was done all those years ago. The fact that she has promised to give me some money to put on my credit card, but has failed to do so. The same person that expects me to help pay some of her bills, because I live with her, and she continually speak to/treat me like I am worth nothing to her .. which is exactly how I feel. My simple equation for her is this: treat me like nothing, speak to me like I mean nothing to you, and you get nothing done by me, you get no bills paid by me because of the fact it's feeding her ego .. she can do it and get things done/stuff paid by me .. NOT happening!

So what's your advice guys? Write the email? Or just try and find a way of getting out, then send it to her.. Thanks for your help in advance guys ..",Things have gotten WORSE - I'm in split minds though.,AuSSiETiG3R,2020-03-22 08:51:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fmwvm7/things_have_gotten_worse_im_in_split_minds_though/,2,1.0,2,10,308
domesticviolence,"We‚Äôve been together almost 2 years. Things have been rocky between me (23F) and him (24M) for almost a year now. The rockiness started after I discovered a betrayal from him. Nothing as bad as physically cheating, but I found out that he had been lying to me and deceiving me about important parts of his past, things he‚Äôs done, and he trickle-truthed me about what really went down for months.

He has a temper. His friends and family and I all know this about him and it‚Äôs a well-known fact that he gets mad really easily and has a hard time controlling himself when he does, usually he‚Äôll start cursing, yelling, calling people names, ball up his fists, throw things (not at people), punch things (not people), and when he‚Äôs really angry he‚Äôll sometimes start punching himself. We‚Äôve gotten into some really bad fights over the past year and he‚Äôs done all of those things at some point, but he‚Äôs never laid a hand on me.

Important to note, when I first discovered his betrayal, I did something terrible. I was so hurt and I felt so betrayed that I punched him in the arm multiple times. He told me to do it. He said that he deserved to be hurt for the way he hurt me. And I punched him probably like 10 times or so. I am incredibly ashamed that I did that, and I have never laid a hand on him ever again since that happened a year ago. 

Fast forward to today, we were at my house and we got in a huge fight. He broke up with me. I kept begging him to stay and talk but he kept telling me to get out of his way so he could leave. I wouldn‚Äôt let him leave so he grabbed my neck with his hand (like choking me) firmly but not very hard. It didn‚Äôt hurt but I was so stunned that he was able to get past me and leave. He left and drove back to his house but I followed him to his house and his parents let me in. I wanted to talk and apologize for the things that I‚Äôd said during the fight but he kept telling me to leave. I stood in the doorway and blocked him from leaving. I know it was wrong of me not to leave when he kept telling me to leave over and over again. This went on for maybe about an hour, me pleading with him to please talk and him telling me to leave. Eventually, he grabbed me by the jacket and pulled me away from the door and said that I had to leave. I still wouldn‚Äôt leave (again, I know that‚Äôs my fault for not respecting his wishes). Then he started punching me hard in the arm. He punched me maybe about 5 times or so. His parents heard something was happening and came in and they immediately started taking care of me. He took off out the door and left. I now have a bruise about the size of a tennis ball on my arm below my shoulder. His parents took care of me and about half an hour later he came back and he told his parents to make me leave. They said they wouldn‚Äôt do that because they wanted to make sure I was okay. He then said that he didn‚Äôt regret punching me. That he wanted to hurt me. 

After his parents took me home, I noticed that I had a text from him. The text was sent about an hour after he said he didn‚Äôt regret it. The text said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for hurting you‚Äù

I know the relationship is over. I know we‚Äôre not good for each other and we can never be. I know that you‚Äôre supposed to leave the first time your partner hits you. But I can‚Äôt help but feeling that this is my fault, because I did hit him when I discovered his betrayal, and because I provoked him by not letting him leave when he kept asking me to. And as bad as all of this sounds, we were really so good together when he wasn‚Äôt angry. I saw a future with him. I wanted to marry him and have a family with him. He made me so happy. All the silly inside jokes and pet names and the way his eyes would twinkle when he smiled and the way he would nuzzle me and the way he smells. I won‚Äôt ever find those things again with another person. Maybe I‚Äôll find someone who makes me happy too, but it won‚Äôt ever be the same as the way he made me feel. We won‚Äôt have the same inside jokes or pet names and he won‚Äôt smell the same or nuzzle me the same and his eyes won‚Äôt twinkle the same. I miss him so much and I don‚Äôt think I have the strength to leave for good. If he ever came back and begged for me to take him back, I think I would, because I love him so much and I miss him so much and things were so good when they weren‚Äôt bad. 

Logically, I know that we can‚Äôt ever be together again. But I‚Äôm having a really hard time coming to terms with this. I know that this is how people get trapped in abusive relationships, because they stay for all the good parts and ignore all the bad. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm strong enough to get over this and give up on him on my own. I still keep thinking that this was just a hiccup and we can get better and things can be good again. I think I‚Äôm in denial. I just want to reply to his text so badly and have things go back to how they were before this all happened.

I told him to just please leave! He text me that it‚Äôs war when he gets home . He tried  to break something in my car, but instead disconnected the battery. I‚Äôve gotten to the hate part, but it‚Äôs been like that for a bit.

We are about to finish up mediation and solve the financial decisions of the split, and then it's just waiting for the court to review the resolution and approve it. 

I've been on here, sharing what I learned, enthusiastically recommending Lundy Bancroft books, and another book that really helped me was: Gaslighting: Recognize Manipulative and Emotionally Abusive People - and Break Free.  I randomly found this at the library and it was really helpful. The biggest thing I learned was that if an abusive person wants out of the relationship, Don't Stop Them! Let them go. If you convince them to stay, you will become more in danger. Although my husband was not physically abusive, his verbal abuse, disdain, and disrespect was getting worse and worse. 

So when he said he wanted a divorce, I saw the shock on his face when I said, ""Ok, how soon can you move out?"" 9 days later, he was gone.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôll try to keep it shortish since it is a long-winded story.

Basically, my (20F) brother (29) and his fianc√© (29) moved down with their son (1) into my mom‚Äôs house about a month ago. We were super excited because that was the first time we got to meet their son and the whole family was reunited after living states apart for years.
As soon as they moved in, I began realizing how abusive my brother was toward his fianc√©. I‚Äôm talking mentally, emotionally, verbally, physically, and financially. He always did something to her when nobody else was around, so I personally never caught him doing any of the physical stuff but I saw the damage it left to my mom‚Äôs property and I witnessed the emotional/mental/verbal/financial abuse. I never knew my brother was like this. As a child, I knew he had a temper, but I couldn‚Äôt have imagined it was like this.

Basically ‚Äî yesterday, my mom and I were hanging out with Fianc√© in the living room. She had been drinking because her husband-to-be is a piece of shit, and I honestly don‚Äôt blame her. But she‚Äôs epileptic, and prone to seizures when she‚Äôs stressed, especially while drunk. My two brothers came home and the one she thought she wanted to marry was MAD she had been drinking. They started bickering and that‚Äôs when her first seizure started.

It was my first time seeing a seizure in person and I was floored. She has a second seizure within 3 minutes so my brother (her fianc√©) calls 911. She gets scared and yells at him not to call. She gets up from the couch and moved towards him to get the phone from his hand. (She‚Äôs not running, keep in mind. In no way did she present as aggressive or a threat.)

He body checks her five feet across the living room. Her head, with all of her 150 pounds on top of it, SMACKS onto a marble end table and she falls to the floor like a dead weight, completely unresponsive. I thought he just killed her. 
An ambulance comes right as she has a third seizure. I drive brother to the hospital, and he gets arrested on the spot for battery (though he was just released today, after a short overnight stay in jail). I stay in the ER from 12a-530a to be with Fianc√©. I was questioned by police for the first time ever and filled out a report for the first time ever, I watched my brother get patted down and handcuffed.

Fianc√© is fine, no lasting injuries, and at this point in time, she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs going to press charges.

This is where I need help. It feels like... I don‚Äôt know, like I can‚Äôt properly process the past day and a half? Like, nothing feels real right now and I kinda feel like I‚Äôm not in the ‚Äúfront seat‚Äù of my existence, if that makes sense?

domesticviolence,"Hello, I'm looking for some advice on my situation. I have an older sister who has had a history of hitting me, which has only become more frequent in recent years. She punches and slaps me, sometimes using objects such as wooden boards; she also pulls my hair and kicks me. She has sometimes threatened me with knives. Whenever I cry, she mocks me, and she often laughs or smiles when inflicting pain to me. Never once has she apologized.

My sister also emotionally abuses and regularly insults me. Aside from the regular remarks like ""idiot"", ""retard"", ""loser"", etc., she also tells me that I should go kill myself and/or that I should have already killed myself. Although, she is aware that I am depressed and have recently been suicidal, she still pokes fun at my ""mental instability"". Otherwise, she never listens to me or says/does anything polite or nice, and regularly tells me that she hates me.

I've given up on telling these things to my mom. In the past, she would respond by either making us apologize to each other, or giving my sister a light lecture (which has never caused my sister to change any of her behavior). 

I do not have any trusted adults in my life (we do not have contact with relatives outside our immediate family, and my counseling department at school is quite frankly not very useful- I've tried talking to them but haven't received any helpful advice). I told a friend about this, and they've told me to fight back against my sister. I do not believe that is the answer, however I have several times slapped her back in self defense. All our conflicts end in me either giving up or crying; she never appears to show remorse. 

We are in the same academic year (since she has gotten held back), so we will be going to college soon and I can only hope that one of us moves out so that I do not have to live with her. We go to different schools, and I have an after school job, so I do not see her often on most days, but since everything is shut down due to the coronavirus, I am stuck at home with her. She has been hitting me nearly everyday for the past week, and I am beginning to experience suicidal thoughts again.

domesticviolence,"My husband recently had a mental breakdown and decided to confess all his many secrets to me: He‚Äôs a pathological liar; he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs capable of love; he was sexually abused as a kid and then tried to do it to another kid; he repeatedly beat our dog; he attacked my cat, causing his eye to pop out; he has had sexual feelings towards our children; and he was having thoughts of suicide using one of his guns (he‚Äôs a hunter and has many guns). 

And these are just the things I didn‚Äôt know about. He‚Äôs been emotionally abusive and manipulative for many, many years, especially targeting our only son. But I was dealing with it and picking up the pieces after he made a mess (he‚Äôs incapable of remorse). 

He has slapped our son a couple times. He threatened to hit our daughter. He threw something at the wall, creating a hole in the drywall, inches from where two of my girls were sitting in bed. He‚Äôs a sex addict, and I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be so angry and wouldn‚Äôt target the kids as much if I accommodated him, so I made myself have sex with him, but since I ‚Äúconsented,‚Äù it was never rape (even though I hated it). So it seems the law can‚Äôt do much, since he hasn‚Äôt physically abused us yet. And CPS won‚Äôt help until AFTER he has sexually abused one of my children.

The day after he confessed everything, I had him leave, and I filed for divorce as soon as I could. First I tried to get an immediate protection order at the advice of a lawyer, but the commissioner rejected it, even with threats of suicide at the top of my list on the paperwork. 

We just had the hearing for temporary custody arrangements yesterday. My husband lied so many times on his paperwork, but nothing was done about it. I got child support but no maintenance, my request that he get a psychological evaluation was not granted, and now he gets unsupervised visitation with my children every other week. The commissioner thought I was exaggerating in my declaration. I literally said everything exactly how he confessed it. 

When all this began, I talked to my bishop at church, who also thought I was overreacting and tried to push marriage counseling on me. My husband is giving everyone at church some sob story, winning over all their sympathy (I don‚Äôt go there anymore). They are all under his manipulation. 

My children and I are so much happier without him here. We finally feel peace. And even my daughter‚Äôs teacher at school was seeing a noticeable change in her for the better. We‚Äôre doing so much better, but the law isn‚Äôt helping me. It still seems like he‚Äôs winning. 

He will absolutely manipulate my kids during these visits, trying to convince them of how great a father he is. They‚Äôve never known anything else. They don‚Äôt know what a good father looks like. They don‚Äôt realize that it isn‚Äôt okay for a father to completely ignore them unless he decides to feel powerful over them and rage at them. 

We are possessions to this sociopath, and it will be a huge fight to get him to let go of us. And it doesn‚Äôt seem that the law will help us much. The court is so worried about a man not getting to see his kids that it refuses to entertain the thought that maybe in this case my children are so much better without him in their lives.",They think I‚Äôm overreacting.,ItNeverRainEveryDay,2020-03-19 07:17:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fl5v66/they_think_im_overreacting/,25,0.97,47,4,596
domesticviolence,"I‚Äôve been with jake (fake name) for about 3 years. We rent a house together and there‚Äôs still nearly 11 months before our lease runs out. 

Never had any kind of serious problems in our whole relationship. I mean we do argue occasionally but he‚Äôs never tried to physically hurt me before or anything 

This is what happened .. 

I was in the bedroom just on my phone and he was out in the living room. I think he may have been on the game idk but I could hear him getting frustrated at the tv for not working properly or something and then I hear him start walking to our bedroom. No big deal he wasebt yelling or anything. But when he came in the room, out of nowhere he just slammed our door shut behind him. It made the whole wall shake and it made me jump a bit because I dident think he was that angry about the tv. I said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt slam the door‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want to get a noise complaint or anything or have him break the door as we are only renters. I was not trying to be rude or anything like I was just saying. 

He got so angry that I said this. He started yelling that he never tells me what to do so I shouldn‚Äôt try to tell him what to do. I tried to explain that I wasn‚Äôt telling him what to do and while I was trying to explain it to him he managed to grab me off the bed and kind of shoved me into the door corner. I put my arms infront of me to stop him from getting close to me and idk if you‚Äôd call it a hit or a slap but he hit me on the cheek with like his fist ... it wasent a punch but it was with his fist but it dident really hurt that much but it did freak me out cause it made me start tearing up. Not because I was in pain or anything but just idk I was just freaking out and started crying.? 

He dident do anything else. He did swear but I think he was swearing at himself. (He doesn‚Äôt usually swear) and he held my face and hugged me after for a pretty long time. He apologised to me a little while afterward and I said it was ok. He said it wasent ok and that he wouldn‚Äôt ever do anything like it again. 

I do believe him I think I‚Äôm just a bit spooked so I‚Äôm having a hard time relaxing around him. 

It all happened within like 30 seconds I‚Äôm not sure how it escalated so quickly. Think I might be slightly overreacting by even posting this here. I‚Äôm not injured it barely even hurt even though I did start crying. He‚Äôs promised not to do it again and I have no reason to not believe him as he has been very nice to me since it happened. 

Is it ok if I forgive him ? I know the saying like if he hits you once he‚Äôll do it again. But I feel my situation might be different. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd leave if he ever did it again. But I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna do it again

He lives a little while out of town his mum &amp; dad own lots of property. Anyway we were in his room it was just him and I at the house. He was being annoying and trying to convince me to do some things I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with so I kept saying no. He wouldn‚Äôt stop asking so I said I wanted to go home. He then said that he wouldn‚Äôt drive me home until I atleast tried to do what he wanted to ‚Äòsee if I liked it‚Äô ( he was asking me to blow him) 

This made me panic because we were the only ones here and it was too far to walk back into town so my only way back was for him to drive me. Or I wait for his mum to come home and ask her to take me back but I had no idea what time she‚Äôd be home and he wouldn‚Äôt tell me. 

I went and sat in his lounge room while he stayed in his room. I thought he‚Äôd eventually stop being an asshole and take me home. 

He came out to where I was and he handed me a Condom and made me put it on him he kept grabbing me when I tried to sit up 

I refused to do anything else I just kind of sat there until he moved. 

I TOLD him then I dident want to do anything at all and that I wanted him to drive me home right now or I‚Äôd call someone and tell them what he was doing. 

He pulled my hair really hard my neck flicked back and while he was yelling in my ear he‚Äôd ripped my phone out Of my hand 

I was able to immediately snatch it back from him but that made him angry and he ended up hitting me in my face. 

I dident say anything after hed hit me and he then let me get into his car and he drove me home. 

He mumbled a sorry when I got out of his car

I haven‚Äôt talked to him since. I think I‚Äôm too scared honestly I get nervous Just thinking about what happened. 

I haven‚Äôt told anyone about what happened I feel gross that he made me put a condom on him. 

He‚Äôs been texting me non stop though I haven‚Äôt replied I‚Äôve just been ignoring him.

domesticviolence,"Details, bare with me:
I live with my Girlfriend and I moved away from family so she could be with hers in the end.
Everything was great at first, until she got to drinking. The first while it was fun drunk. Then one morning I woke up to her drinking and in the end I had to physically block the car with my body to stop her from driving off drunk that morning for more beer and that was our first real verbal fight.
The domestic is coming up just hold.
Not long after she was drinking and pretty sad talking about suicidal stuff. So she agreed to come to work with me. On the way she tried to jump out of the car 3 times. The third I almost lost control of the vehicle trying to keep her from going out.

Tonight was the final straw, and where it becomes domestic... she woke me up acting cute while extremely intoxicated but also telling me she was worried about her grandmother. I knew something was up so while she was hugging me I swiped her car keys from her coat. She left the room a minute so I grabbed mine and hid both.
She came back in aggrivated and I tried to play off being sleepy. She confronted me and I told her to just get sleep and we can go be with her grandmother in the morning. Her answer, she grabbed my glock 23 .40 cal.
I'm trained with firearms and had it in my armoire with a cover. She started to pull it out, I remained calm talking, but grabbed the slide with my forefingers to hold it back with my grip on the handle so it couldn't fire. I tried to simply pull it away but she started fighting. I had no choice but to knee her leg so she would lose grounding and she lost the gun. I removed the mag and cleared the chamber. All firearms were moved to my trunk. She claims she was going to walk to her grandmother's and keep her safe.

Where I need help; I love this woman with all my heart and want to salvage this relationship if I can.

domesticviolence,"We were in our early 20s and hadn't known each other long but quickly got serious. I ended up needing to stay with him because I had nowhere else to go. He soon became very sexually abusive and controlling. He ended up raping me a few times.  

I was young, naive, and ignorant but I had this strong feeling that I had to keep pretending that everything was fine until I could find a safe way to leave. I also had a strong feeling that he could kill me. 

When I finally decided I had enough and couldn't take it anymore, I told him that he should go back to his mom's house and I should move back in with my family (Who lived across the country) so that we could save up enough money to get a decent place together. 

He readily agreed because the place we were staying at was far too expensive and we were both sick of never having enough money. I made no indication that I was done with the relationship and made sure to talk about how long I would be gone and what the plans were when I would move back. 

I had to leave some stuff behind because I couldn't take it on a plane with me. It was a great excuse for him to hold on to some of my stuff ""for the future"". I made sure to only leave behind what I was okay never getting back again. 

He drove me to the airport when the time came, we said our good byes (even though I hated him, I cried. I didn't understand then but it was probably part of trauma bonding), I got on my plane flight and got safely home. No drama, no safety concerns. 

After a couple months of being back home, I broke up with him. And that was it. He has never tried to come after me. I've been safe from him ever since. 

So simple and easy without being married or having kids. I wish it was that simple this time but without evidence to back up my claims, I can't be sure the legal system will side with me and keep my kids safe from him. 

Though I do get a sense that my husband could do a murder/suicide if the conditions are right, I also feel that if I give him the same promise of a temporary separation for the sake of a better future together, he may be willing to move out and let me have custody of the kids.

domesticviolence,"My family's been going through a lot of issues regarding my brother as he's grown up and the situation is escalating to a point that I'm worried something awful is going to happen. I've tried to stay out of it but I feel like something has to be done; I just don't know what that something is and I was hoping someone could give me some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this brief; my brother is 16 (I'm 21) and my parents are getting on in their years. They're both past 55 and their advanced age makes it hard to handle my brother. I love my parents dearly, but they never really disciplined my brother and he's been diagnosed with ADHD. I'm gonna try and explain this without ranting/complaining but I feel like the context is important to the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is incapable of taking care of himself, he eats only junk food (once a day and that one time is always late at night) and never takes swallows the medicine my parents give him. He's constantly filthy and he usually refuses to take a shower for at least a week. Despite his diet, he's still a growing boy and he's much taller than everyone in the house. He got the hunter genes from my dad and I got the ""never leave the house"" lifestyle from my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only interactions he has with my parents are indifferent at best and openly aggressive at worst. Any time he doesn't spend in his room is spent either outside the house or tormenting my parents. But he's 16 years old and he's a growing boy; I remember what it was like to be that age and I get that everyone is a prick when they're a teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

But my parents lack of discipline for my brother has resulted in him doing whatever he wants at any given moment and he expects to be given whatever he wants. If he's refused anything, he gets extremely angry and violent at a moment's notice. He attacks my mom at least once a week in a blind rage, and it's usually over a petty argument like her asking him to go to bed at 11 at night (he always stays up late screaming over his Xbox microphone, keeping the rest of the house awake). He doesn't attack my dad because he's still afraid of him, but my dad is so reluctant to punish him that as long as my brother doesn't attack him he won't get involved. This has been the status quo of my house for at least three years now, I've been living at college off and on and I vacation with family in another state, so I try to wash my hands of it and not let it ruin my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even this wouldn't prompt me to ask publicly for advice because I've been used to it happening for so long. However, he's starting getting worse lately and my dad is incredibly weak from having a kidney transplant (literally the worst time for it), so my brother has deteriorated further. I took an unloaded hunting rifle that was supposed to be locked in my dad's gun cabinet out of his room yesterday that he was bragging to his friends about having. Things going missing around the house is just a reality of living with him and we never get them back (I keep a lock on my door 100% of the time), but the lighter and candles have gone missing and sometimes it smells like smoke in our kitchen. The final straw was him arguing with my mom about not eating all of the cookies she just made before anyone else could get any, resulting in him smashing everything in his room and threatening her with a rusty axe that he apparently just had lying around. He's never hit anyone so hard that they've had to go to the hospital, but his fits of rage are so violent and he apparently has enough hidden weapons that I'm worried that it's only a matter of time before he either burns the house down or permanently injures my parents (or himself). 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in my life has told me to try and get out of this house and I never get involved anymore, but is there something I can do about this?

domesticviolence,"I attempted to leave my partner (who has been emotionally abusive for much of our two year relationship, and physically violent on one recent occasion) yesterday. I have made multiple attempts to leave but always end up being talked into coming back, or coming back on my own due to loneliness and isolation. Yesterday they sent me a few angry text messages about a sensitive topic (upset about ongoing consequences of me reporting the violence to the police) and I ignored them for some time before responding that I was done with the relationship, I was leaving for good and they needed to cease all contact with me immediately. I reacted so quickly (immediately getting in my car with my prepacked safety bag and driving off) because they have been using old abuse tactics lately and I am afraid of it escalating to violence again, but so far it had only happened when we were together so I just sat there and took it and did what I could to appease them. I stopped responding again but would occasionally send back comments about how they have treated me, how afraid I was, etc. When I was sure I was safe to go back home, I did. Hours later they came to knock on my door saying they were worried I had hurt myself because I wasn‚Äôt responding (I have issues with self harm and suicidal ideation especially related to their abusive tendencies so this isn‚Äôt completely unfounded). We began fighting over the phone and I was saying shitty things about them and the ways they have hurt me and how badly I have been affected by it. I was mostly talking about how much they have blamed me for the consequences of their abuse (police have been involved, there‚Äôs an ongoing court case, and disciplinary processes through our university) because they repeatedly tell me I shouldn‚Äôt have ever told anyone or reported anything, and have coerced me into lying to protect them. Anyways, now they are pinning the entire fight on me and saying that I was being abusive to them by leaving the way I did and ignoring their texts/calls and refusing to let them know that I was safe. I feel like it was shitty of me to leave so abruptly because they do have extreme anxiety and they don‚Äôt have anyone else supporting them, I am all that they really have. But it feels horrible to be called abusive by this person, especially when I was reacting to a cycle of horrible treatment towards me. I just want out of this and I don‚Äôt know how to do that when they are continually trying to make me feel guilty for taking the time and space that I know I deserve. This all makes me feel crazy and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs true anymore. I don‚Äôt want to hurt them, I really don‚Äôt, but I feel like this abuse is never going to stop and even when things are great with us I am constantly afraid of doing something wrong that will set them off and make them spiral into anger. They have promised to never be violent with me again, but I don‚Äôt know how to trust that when they had promised it would never happen in the first place and it did. They also say it wasn‚Äôt severe abuse (even though they choked me twice and made me feel like I was going to die, gave me a concussion, and stole my personal belongings including house keys before kicking me out in the freezing cold) and don‚Äôt seem to understand why that feels so harmful to me. But if I bring any of this up they say it‚Äôs just me trying to blame them for my actions. Am I crazy? Am I really abusing them by trying to leave and I just can‚Äôt see it? This all feels so unreal at this point and I miss them desperately because I want the the version of them from the good times we had together to come back.

domesticviolence,"I've been with my partner for almost two years. We have twins that are almost a year old. Our relationship has been sprinkled with violence since the beginning. Nothing on the extreme end, it only happens every few months, and it usually (but not always) accompanies alcohol. The first time he laid his hands on me in anger, I was pregnant, and he shoved me onto a bed. He admits it was wrong, but always follows with ""but it was onto a soft surface"". Since then it's mainly been violent outbursts against objects (breaking mirrors, ripping art off of walls, etc) with a few pushes and shoves and ""lighter"" abuse here and there. He's never actually HIT me. 

Last night he came home drunk at midnight then left to walk the dog. I wasn't happy about it (I'm often left to care for the babies alone), so out of pettiness I locked the door behind him. I thought he had his keys with him. My intention was not to lock him out but to put a small annoying obstacle in his way upon returning home. A baby woke, and I went to the bedroom to nurse her. Partner came back while I was trying to get her re-settled and started knocking on the door, gradually getting more insistent until he was banging. I was trying to keep from waking the baby back up.

Finally I was able to get away to open the door for him, and as soon as I unlocked it, he slammed it open in my face then pushed me out of the way. Alarmed, I tried to push him back out the door and close/lock it again, but he pushed his way back into the house, grabbed me by my hair, pulling a chunk out, and slammed me to the ground. I screamed and retreated to the bedroom, locked the door, and comforted my scared babies.

That was the most violent episode yet. I know it's not much comparatively, but it's enough that I'm really, really upset. But what I'm even more upset about than the violence is that HIS version of the story is that I pushed HIM as soon as I opened the door and he threw me to the ground as a response. In fact, pretty much every time I try to talk to him about this type of behavior, he has a twist on the story that basically ""justifies"" his actions (even though he vehemently denies that he's justifying).

What complicates our situation the most is that MOST of the time, we have a really great relationship, and I love being with him. These violent situations are kind of anomalies. In the two years we've been together, something like this has only happened five-ish times, but every time, he'll admit he was wrong AND justify why he did it. His unwillingness/inability to accept FULL responsibility for his actions leaves me with little hope that this problem will go away. And even though it seldom happens, it does often enough that I'm unwilling to have my daughters grow up witnessing it.

I've tried to get him to go to therapy, but he says that type of thing doesn't work for him and what he REALLY needs is a loving, compassionate partner who's willing to help him work through it. I, of course, translate that as ""a partner who's willing to continue being abused while I attempt to address my issues"".

There are, of course, more intricacies, but that's the gist of the situation, and I just need help making sense of it. Leaving the father of my children is a BIG deal that I don't take lightly, and I would like some outside perspective. Thank you.",Every few months...

domesticviolence,"A little more than a year ago, after a really hard time in our lives, my husband told me that he had seriously thought about taking us all in our van and driving us off of a cliff to kill us all. 

The other day he said in front of the kids that whenever he thinks about killing the kids, he looks at one of them and thinks they're too cute. It was meant to be kind of humorous but considering everything else, it's not that funny and he shouldn't have said it in front of them.

He sometimes tells the kids or says to me in front of the kids that we should give them up for adoption or that we should have taken them to Planned Parenthood. 

 Sometime in the last week or so he said that if we moved up to my parents house, he would want to kill my sister's miserable dog that lives there and buy our own dog. 

He has told me a few times about how he hated his dad when he was young and thought about killing him. 

He freely admits to having killed and abused animals for the fun of it when he was younger. 

He keeps bugging me to ask my family if he can buy a gun off of them in case someone breaks into the house. But I'm afraid of what he would do if he had a gun and was depressed, angry, or really upset. 

Several times he has raised his hand to me, acting like he wanted to slap me (sometimes when I was pregnant) when I said things he didn't like or called him out on bad behavior. 

He has gently thrown things at me, some of them hitting me, when I have said things he didn't like or called him out on bad behavior.

domesticviolence,"Hello all,

I made a post in /relationships and was referred here after my post. The short of the story is my partner put his hands around my neck (didn't squeeze) and yanked my hair after an argument. He has done similar things in the past, such as raising a fist to me to intimidate. He's also been violent with others and has admitted to trying to actively murder someone who was abusive in the past.

Needless to say, this terrifies me and this feels like an escalation and I am not sure I can continue with this. Initially he was very unapologetic and told me I should feel embarrassed for making him do that. I've left to stay with my parents for awhile a couple hours away, and now he's overapologizing and has suddenly decided to go to therapy. Though he suddenly is denying any of this happened. He said he never put his hand on me, he just put it NEAR my neck, and he's saying that he never pulled my hair. He apparently just disassociated, his hand was numb and it just accidentally got caught in my hair. It seems like gaslighting to me. 

I will have to return to my home at some point (we live together and we're in a lease for another year and both our names are on the lease.) I do work from home so it's a possibility I could go back and get my stuff and live with my parents, though I'd probably still be responsible for the lease. Or I could go back and try to live with him for the remainder. I'm not sure how safe this is, and I'm worried I might fall right back into the role of being a girlfriend and potentially get physically harmed.

domesticviolence,"Recently, my partner of two years became increasingly abusive. Emotional volatility and abuse has been a routine part of our fights the entire time we‚Äôve been together, but it became physical about two months ago. It was horrific abuse that threatened my life, and yet we have gotten back together. Right after the incident I got a protection order (which they were later arrested for violating) but I still ended up going back. They were suspended from the university we attend together pending a full investigation for violence and stalking, but while we have been on good terms they have coerced me into lying to cover up everything for them. They have been volatile and snap at me over tiny problems. Last night while fighting they took my phone, intimated me into unlocking it, and deleted my social media (only contact with friends that are very important to me) saying ‚Äúwhen did i give you permission to use that?‚Äù. I‚Äôm exhausted. In trying to stay safe I packed an emergency safety bag to keep in a safe location and while doing that I had a bit of a breakdown realizing that this just isn‚Äôt a way to live. I love this person. I adore them with my entire heart and they are so ingrained in my daily life that I genuinely cannot imagine living without them. But it just isn‚Äôt worth it.

So my mom has been with this guy for 8 years. Throughout the relationship my mom has said that she‚Äôs broken up with him so the 8 years is kind of ‚Äúiffy‚Äù but she doesn‚Äôt want him to live here anymore. She‚Äôs told him multiple times to move out throughout the years but he just stays. He doesn‚Äôt pay rent and he‚Äôs not on the lease. I myself have never liked this man and I‚Äôve called the police on him twice during their relationship (one for drug possession and abuse, and the second one for abuse as well) and those calls didn‚Äôt make a dent in him leaving. 

He‚Äôs abused my mom mentally for years but physically twice, which I‚Äôve been around to witness. Well the 2nd physical abuse moment happened yesterday and I almost called the police, I really was going to but right when I was going to.. my mom‚Äôs friend shows up. I should‚Äôve called but my two experiences with the police in my small Minnesotan town were hopeless so I didn‚Äôt. What I want to happen is to get this man out, ASAP. He doesn‚Äôt deserve my mother and never has. 

My mom and I have plotted different ideas to get him out once and for all but I really think with all I have stacked against him, I could just call the police and he‚Äôd be sent away in a snap. Now, that‚Äôs what I want more than ever but it‚Äôs never that easy. Would I be able to just call and get him out of here with probable cause just like that? I really want it to be. I‚Äôve also thought of moving out all his stuff while he‚Äôs gone since my mom has asked him nicely to start moving out and he hasn‚Äôt moved an inch. I despise this man and I want him as many light years away from my mom as possible. I just want it all to be over.

domesticviolence,"Dear Reddit


I have recently found the courage and capability to leave my physically and emotionally abusive boyfriend. Over the last 4 months of our 2 1/2 year relationship, he has managed to isolate me from my dearest friends. He has kicked me in the middle of the road, ripped out my hair, humiliated me in front of his friends, destroyed my self esteem and also slapped me in the middle of heated arguments that had little merit. He was controlling, read my messages, insisted on prioritising him over my career and has somehow made it seem like all of this was my fault.

I recently realised he was a textbook abuser. He may not have been the kind to kill me in a fit of fury, but he certainly was not pleasant to deal with. I found a way to reconnect with some old friends who offered me their place to stay since he doesn't know where they live and therefore cannot come by to my house to scream at/hurt me.

While I am coping well with a willing support system, I feel extremely ashamed at what I put myself through (even though he's the one who should be ashamed). I wanted us to part on decent terms but he has threatened me with legal action in case I try to ruin his reputation. He always finds a way to bother me. I also feel like an emotional burden on my friends though I don't believe they've ever tried to make me feel that way. 

I feel lost. I have been drinking through the entire week. I feel alone because some of his friends became my friends, and they have all blocked me. I don't know what lies he must have told them but it has certainly made me feel alone. I desperately want to consult a therapist. But I can't even afford it. 
If there's someone out there who can help me in some way... Please help me. I always thought of myself as a smart, independent and strong woman but now...



I'm lost.







Edit/Update


He returned to my house last night. He arrived with a bottle of whiskey and our dog to try and make me believe that he was a changed man. 

I discovered he had been cheating on me with two other women. They were young college girls and had no clue. They were blown away by his charm.

Last night was the first time I felt pure rage and fury instead of humiliation and sorrow. He initially denied it. Cried even. Asked me to trust him. 

Once I presented him with the screenshots (his instagram was logged into my company given laptop that I barely used) he became violent.

It gave me some serious satisfaction to pour his expensive whiskey out the balcony and throw his possessions outside my door. He did hit me. He even hit me with a walking stick. But it was worth it.

It is not possible for me to involve the police. In India there is far too much stigma surrounding such allegations and it often backfires on the woman's future and career. 

But I didn't have to file a complaint. I locked him outside and dialed the helpline number to inform the police that I'd be visiting them to file a report on domestic abuse the next day. I asked them to send me the address of the nearest station and set up a time. 

While he had initially threatened to make my life hell if I went to the police (his family is deeply rooted in the currently reigning government), he understood that in this case his advantage would work against him. The police would definitely inform his family, and everyone would know what he had done. 

Since I had overwhelming evidence and witnesses for his abusive behaviour, I also threatened to publicly shame him, and throw any concerns about myself out the window. Perhaps the hysteria in my voice sold it, and he started to weep and beg me to do nothing if he left me alone. I said I would consider it and he finally left my apartment. 

Thank you redditors, for encouraging me to walk away and involve the authorities. I was too ashamed to reach out to anyone, but I am so thankful for your support. I am traumatized and in shock, but I am also angry and motivated. I know I will be fine now.

Two days ago, we were drinking and having a good night when he got upset and jealous that I went to the post office with a coworker (because I had to know how to do this for my new job!!) and was telling him about things my coworker has told me about, like quantum physics and other stupid shit. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be a fight, but that‚Äôs what happened. He started getting upset, so I left the room and went upstairs. He followed me. After that, we continued to verbally argue and yell at each other. During this time, the neighbors called the police and told them specific words he had said. These words were threatening to me and my family and at the time he was holding a knife. He did not harm me in anyway with the knife, however. He did punch me on my legs, which I had a red mark after, after I bit him. Shit went down. Eventually, the cops showed up and immediately took me outside of my apartment. He was still inside, and at least four police officers ran inside to get him. I talked to the police and told them what had happened. They did tell me what the neighbors heard, which was something he said. I admitted to him saying those things. I was afraid at that point and told them I was afraid. They told me he would be booked on a misdemeanor domestic assault. That night, I saw his charges were much worse than just that. He is being charged with two felonies related to what the neighbor heard and the fact that he was holding a knife. 

I do not want him to be in jail. I know that it would be the end of his life to be in jail for anytime after his hearing. He has had a prior domestic violence in a different state, around 5 years ago. Is there anything I can do as the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù to help him get out of jail?

domesticviolence,"Hi, posting from a throwaway account as I want this to be anonymous....

Apologies for the long post in advance. I just need some outside perspective and advice.

I'm 23F. My partner is 31M. We've been together since I was 17. He was living with his 'ex' when I first started seeing him, but assured me they were broken up. About a year in, I found out they were still together. I told him to make a choice. He chose me, moved out of the flat he shared with his ex, left her everything they owned together, and moved in with his father.

We took a gap year before going to uni and this is where the problems started. He started to blame me for losing everything in his life. He became depressed and suicidal and said it was all my fault and I guess, in a way it was because I told him he had to move out with his ex if he wanted to be with me. I couldn't handle his emotions (I'm on the autism spectrum and emotions are really difficult for me to understand or/or process). For a short-period of time, I self-harmed and attempted to overdose because I felt like there was no escape from it. My mother found out and blamed my partner, and they had a big argument. After the tempers went down and I stopped doing that stuff, my mother offered to bury the hatchet with my partner but he refused and they have never spoken since. I've asked him to come over to our house many times, but he refuses to and tries to turn me against my mother. He also refuses to introduce me to his family as he is ashamed of my age. His family and friends do not know he has a girlfriend.

We then went to uni. I moved into student digs and he stayed with his father. I felt like I couldn't participate in Freshers, go out for a drink, join clubs etc. He never came out and said I could not, and even told me I should, but then would always end the sentence with 'but it's not something you would enjoy and I wouldn't like you as a person if you did'. I failed to make any friends at uni.

His granddad died and then his mother started drinking heavily. He became really suicidal and everytime I suggest he see a doctor or therapist to help him get through it, he would get aggressive (not physically) and say that I was just passing the problem onto someone else because I didn't care enough for him to fix it myself.

He then started to threaten me with suicide whenever he didn't want me to do something. I wanted to break up with him as I was extremely unhappy, but every time I tried to break it off he would tell me he would kill himself.

It kept getting worse. He would drive to my house in the middle of the night drunk. He would lock me in his car and drive recklessly saying he could kill us both. He was and still is actively trying to get me fired because he doesn't want me to do the PhD I am currently doing now.

Up into this point he had never laid a finger on me. In fact, between all of this he is one of the nicest people you will meet. He will go above and beyond for me and anyone else. I feel stupid for complaining because we did have good times, and he did treat me right.

Then, two days ago, I went out with some people in my office. It was the first time since I've met him that I went out someone who isn't him. He started texting me the usual stuff, demanded I go home and rung me non-stop. In the end, my friend realised I was upset over my phone, took it off me and put it on aeroplane mode.

I stayed out a bit longer, and shared a taxi home with a (male) friend because we live close by. I got out the taxi, waved goodbye, and as soon as the taxi left my partner appeared. He'd been waiting in his car outside my house. He was drunk. He grabbed me, spat in my face, then pinned me against the wall and took my phone and house keys off me. He started screaming at me and accusing me of sleeping with the guy I had shared the taxi with. He said he was going to kill us. I tried to get away from him, but I couldn't get in my house or call anyone for help as he had my keys and phone.

He dragged me to his car and said he was driving me away. I did my best to escape but couldn't.

He started to strangle me. I slapped him to try and get him off me. He then pushed me to the ground and started shouting at me for hitting him.

Luckily, my roommate happened to walk past at this moment. My partner dropped me, and then started to tell my roommate that I was abusing him. My roommate didn't know what to make of the situation but saw me on the floor trying to recover my breathing. He got my phone and keys returned and saw me inside, then asked if I wanted to call the police (I didn't).

Partner then started to text me saying he loved me and for me to come back outside and talk things through properly. He said he wouldn't leave until I came out and spoke to him.

I ended up ringing my mother to pick me up and am now staying at her house. He's still texting me. He says it's just a misunderstanding and that he never meant to strangle me. His exact words were 'I was only trying to usher you inside the house'. He's being really nice over text (I haven't responded to any). He's asking to still be friends. I don't know what to do. He's never really been physical before and it is out of character.

We know the same people, he knows my schedule, we work close by (he's also doing a PhD). We even share a supervisor and he's already been telling our supervisor (made up) bad things about me in an attempt to get me fired. I'm worried what the fallout of this will be if I don't go back to him, but I'm too scared to even see him again. I'm still having difficulties breathing two days later, and finding it difficult to eat and drink as my throat hurts when I swallow.

domesticviolence,"I[26F] left my abusive fianc√©[36M] 3 months ago. We‚Äôve been together for a long time. We have three daughters 
7,5, and 5 months. I am scared to let him get visitation but my kids keep asking for him. I know he wouldn‚Äôt hurt our children but I am afraid of what he‚Äôll do to get me back &amp; I don‚Äôt trust myself to stand my ground if I had to be around him right now. 

I left because he blacked my eye and busted my nose. I don‚Äôt even remember why. I left when he went to work and never looked back.

 I moved in with a friend to a city nearby. Literally about 15/20 min away. It‚Äôs not far but I‚Äôve been able to keep distance from him and he doesn‚Äôt know her or where she lives. Surprisingly he hasn‚Äôt called me repeatedly or anything for the last 3 weeks but I know he‚Äôs going to do something else to try to get in contact with me. 

Also, I don‚Äôt want to, but I may have to cut contact with his mother. She doesn‚Äôt know where I moved but she‚Äôs been sympathetic and has respected why I left her son. She‚Äôs been nothing but help and has really done a lot for me. She‚Äôs prayed with me over the phone, helped me financially, been a motherly figure for me (because mine doesn‚Äôt talk to me since I‚Äôve been with him),and gave me hope when I felt like I wanted to give up. She says that she would wants us back together but she‚Äôs not going to pressure me to be with him because his behavior. 

She told me he called and said he needed to see me and the kids. She said she told him she hasn‚Äôt heard from us. The reason I think I need to cut off contact with her for a while is because that‚Äôs her son and I feel like she‚Äôs going to eventually side with him. 

The main thing weighing on me is my babies. My 7 year olds birthday was last week and my friend got her a cake and bought her a game on her Xbox. My daughter is used to getting more or having a party for her birthday. She was really sad telling me she was bored and wanted to be with her daddy. My 5 year old was the closest to him and she really misses her dad. They complain about why we can‚Äôt go home all the time. It gets me very emotional and I miss him when they bring him up and I hope that maybe in the future he can have a relationship with them but I absolutely can not be around him any time soon if I‚Äôm gonna be adamant about this. 

I feel bad because right now I don‚Äôt have the means to give them what they‚Äôre used to. I use my money that I had in my savings from being with him solely for saving so we can move and making sure they have necessities. Having a small baby really makes it difficult to have money for any extra stuff. My friend is working on getting me a job at her workplace soon so I‚Äôm hopeful about that.

I just wanted advice on how to explain our living situation with my kids and explain to them why we won‚Äôt see their father right now or be going ‚Äúhome‚Äù. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about the future so I won‚Äôt spend time thinking about him and I know it sounds bad but I try my best to tune my children out when they complain about him and where we live now. I know that‚Äôs not effective but it‚Äôs been helping me get through the days and skip over the hard conversation I need to have with them.

domesticviolence,"This morning at work, my colleague (let's call her Sam, not her name) was 10 minutes late. It's just her and myself working today, so I was a little peeved that she was late (again). When she got here she apologized and said she had an argument with her partner. I asked her if everything was alright and she looked at me and said ""Can I ask you a question, Does (partner's name) have any right to be angry about me sleeping with someone four years ago?"" Considering I know that Sam and her partner have barely been together 18 months I reply with ""of course he doesn't, no one has a right to be angry with who you've been with four years ago!"" Then she proceeded to tell me about how he keeps hacking into her phone (she keeps changing the pincode and has fingerprint access but he uses her finger when shes asleep and keeps working out her pincodes) and how all morning he's been calling her ""disgusting"" ""disgusting slut"" . At this point she was in tears. I told her that what he's doing is abuse. She kept crying and stating that she hadn't done anything wrong, which I assured her is the truth!
I believe the reason they are even still together is because not long after meeting, she found out she was pregnant (with his child). As far as I know, he's not active in the care of the 9month old but he does have her alone on Sundays while Sam is at work. This has just started as she just came off maternity leave a couple weeks ago. Last week he ""forgot"" to feed the baby for the 6+ hours that Sam was at work and complained that all the baby did was cry and sleep and then when Sam got angry at him for not feeding her he told Sam that it was no big deal and that she didn't die and that Sam was overreacting.

Sam isn't the brightest bulb on the bush but she is sweet and kind and lovely (even if she was an evil bitch witch) she doesn't deserve this!

domesticviolence,"Hi there.  


TL;DR: Looking for some emotional support, as I feel dismissed and not heard or believed. Not sure how to cope.

  
From 2009-2018, I (F31) was in an abusive relationship with a man (M34). We had a child after 5 years together, then after 7 years I realised that he was abusive. I left in secret, and after advise from another woman with past DV experience, I called the police to say I was worried my partner would do something bad or dangerous. I was already in touch with a few support charities and so on, and I was scared for my safety. He had never hit me or similar, but his violent outbursts and suicide threats were very frightening. He was also emotionally abusive, gaslighting me, and sexually abusing me. I have C-PTSD now, in part due to the long term abuse from him.   


The police person I spoke to on the phone laughed at me. Said ""well what do you want me to do about it? This is nothing to do with us, we can't do anything."". They made me feel utterly stupid and as if I was overreacting completely. I ended up leaving, but took him back the next day, as I still loved him and he promised he'd change and so on. I'm sure you know the script. I got rid of him for good in 2018, 18 months after I first left.  


Fast forward to now. I want to move to my home country with our son. Ex is of course refusing - he wants to keep control of everything he possibly can. I contacted a lawyer for mediation, due to poverty I have to stick to ones that offer legal aid, which is pretty much 1 maybe 2 in my city. The one I found was a woman in her 60s, she had a lot of experience and on paper seemed decent. However during the pre-mediation appointment, she prodded me about why the relationship fell apart, and I said quite honestly that he was xyz abusive, had violent outbursts, and I am currently in therapy to deal with the aftermath of it. 10 minutes later she wrote in her notes whilst saying out loud ""no domestic abuse"". Completely dismissed it.  


My psychologist was very cross, as what my ex did was prosecutable, and this lawyer completely dismissed it. I think my ex must have charmed her, as he comes across super nice, friendly, polite, charming etc etc on the surface. He's a master manipulator, and he saw her before I did. She completely took his side during our mediation, and I feel so defeated. I'm now trying to gather evidence from my contact with DV support services, so that I can get legal aid and maybe go to court to try to get to leave the country. It's a long shot, but I have to do it. Please don't defend my ex that he wants to see our child, and that I'm unreasonable and so on, I can't cope with more of that. It's not a rash decision, I've wanted to go back with my child for over 5 years, and it's 100% the best option for my child and myself.","Angry with police for not taking it seriously, and with lawyer for dismissing my DV experience.

I'm writing to vent. Maybe to seek some validation. but I need to get this out on text and have someone listen.

I think I need to see this. and read it myself.

Even once. Even just for a night. It's not ""just a fight"".

I didn't think too hard about it when you got some pink lemonade in your water at the soda fountain. Yeah, you said you wanted water, but I thought it was normal for some people to tap a little of the lemonade to get a little flavor. I had water anyways, so maybe it's an accident, we can switch.

Maybe its okay you got mad when she found out it wasn't pure water. And maybe I could have better phrased it than ""I think you made a mistake"".  Maybe it's okay to be so angry that you refuse my water and tell me ""I don't want to drink anything you've put your mouth to."" It hurt me, because we had shared a kiss only a few minutes before. Maybe it's okay to get angry that I didn't immediately get you water, but honestly I was trying to understand what I needed to do.

It's not okay to throw water at me in my face then storm off.

Maybe it's okay to get angry that I didn't come after you.

It's not okay to come back and throw the burger at me. And I certainly don't think ""FINE IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? I PAID FOR THE BURGER ANYWAYS, SO YOU RUINED AND WASTED MY MONEY"" is really what you wanted to say.

It's not okay that you grabbed my wrist so hard that it left marks for hours, and dragged me out.

Maybe its okay that you didn't want to give me space. my pants were wet, and my shirt was stained with sauce. I wasn't okay, and I was trying really hard not to be angry. Actually, I was angry and sad.

But It's not okay to tell me I'm a coward, and if I had any legitimate reason or explanation I wouldn't clam up like a dumb robot. Like a politician caught in a lie. FINE I'LL GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK UP A LIE. I'm just going to disprove it, and show you that you're a liar.

Maybe I should have tried harder to try to get through. But every time you cut me off, It took a lot of effort to try to have a conversation. ""Okay, I'm calm! I'm going to listen to your excuses. But maybe you shouldn't focus on how you're the victim in this. you always do"" It took an hour to tell you two things without interruption. ""I want to have a conversation"" ""WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE HAVING. STOP WASTING MY TIME."" ""I want to have a dialogue, and I want to listen to what you have to tell me. And I hope that you want to hear what I want to say""

Maybe I should have offered the shower first. I wanted to get freshened up for a work call. It isn't okay that you tried to stop me from going to work, gripping my wrist so hard you left a second set of marks, and refusing to let go. It's not okay that you threaten suicide if I go to work. It's not okay that you threaten to contact my workplace with rape allegations. It's not okay to threaten me to break my arm with your martial arts training if I try to get my hands free. It's not okay to tell me you've been secretly recording all hour conversations, and that you've named me as the cause in your suicide note. It not okay that you got angry when I changed my tone of voice, and in clearer enunciation stated my name, time, and date, and stated I did not want you to die or kill yourself. It's not okay to run out of the room, and get even more mad that I didn't chase after you.  I promised you we'd talk after my work calls.

Maybe its okay that you got angry that I was recording audio, and told you I was recording audio when I got back. Its not okay to tear my phone out of my hands, and threaten to destroy it. Its not okay that you then threw the phone at the bed, then the floor.

It's not okay that you took my glasses off my face, grabbed me by my collar and shoved me to the wall. She kept shoving, pushing and hitting me until I was cornered. I told you two things ""please don't touch me"" and ""I would like to leave this room. let me leave the room"" It's not okay that you kept shoving me and yelling no. It's not okay that you sat in front of the door of the room and told me that I should kick you if I wanted to leave. It's not okay that when you let me out of the room, you didn't let me get my things. It's not okay you followed me out into the hallway, and cornered me again in front of the elevator. It's not okay you grabbed at my jacket when I ran for the staircase, and I slipped out of the jacket to sprint down the stairs.

It isn't okay.

Thank you for agreeing to come out and talk in an open space with other people. Thank you for agreeing to have me record audio. Thank you for letting me have a dialogue. I hope that you understood me when I told you ""I'm here to have a dialogue. whatever you want to tell me, have me know or understand. Any question you have, or anything you want to know. You decide, okay?"" Every time you cut me off, and every time you ""poked holes"" in my story. ""okay so do you want to talk about that now? I'm here to have a dialogue. whatever you want to tell me, have me know or understand. Any question you have, or anything you want to know. You decide, okay?""

We talked, for 7 hours until the sun was rising. I don't know if you were really listening. I don't know if you noticed. You cut me off every time I was speaking, except for 5 times. I hated myself for counting.

It's not okay that you got angry for the dialogue to not get to a conclusion. I told you, you decide. every time you cut me off, I asked you if thats what you wanted to have to talk about.

I love you. I think you're a special person. Hard working, intelligent. You overcame adversity and are immensely strong, and tremendously vulnerable. You do inspiring work, and for beautifully altruistic goals. Your sense of mission and obligation to give back is endearing and honorable.  I know you have a passion, and your anger against injustice makes you fight for people.

I also know your anger makes you fight me. We've had fights. I haven't been the best boyfriend. I was happy that you told me I was your rock, and that you felt relaxed and happy with me. I want you to be happy. We've gotten over a lot of these hills. some of them almost broke us. You've worked so hard to make this work, way more than I had.

Now you've asked me to just tell you that I'm going to dump you. You've accused me that I've already made up my mind, and I'm just dragging it out to inflict more pain on you. I'm sorry. I really wanted to see you once again. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to know what you are thinking. I didn't want to make a decision by talking to your anger, not the person I loved.

I miss you already.

and I'm sad. I'm sure if I apologize, you will let me back in. We might have some good times again. It's not okay. Today is the day I acknowledge that 13 hours of abuse is still abuse. Abuse is not okay.

It is over. It needs to be over.

Thanks everyone. As a guy, it's not the same. I was never in physical danger. It was only for a night. Because of the community, I had a friendly voice when I ran to a different hotel and asked for help. Because of the community, I recognized that I needed to protect myself.

domesticviolence,"Where to start. We have been together for 8 years. He has managed to sever relationships with my friends and most of my family.  He has been verbally abusive and subject to outrage at any given moment. Doesnt take much for him to lose his cool.  Typically its verbal outbursts with swearing and yelling sometimes breaking things,  slamming doors etc..  then when the smoke has cleared he will give me the silent treatment until I reluctantly admit fault. This all REALLY bothers me due to being a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect. Twice it has been physical. The first time he had my head pinned to the floor then almost a year ago I wound up with a broken nose and blacked out in a pool of blood on my tile floor. He pushed me. We were arguing.  He said I fell. No way I fell because I landed face first and didn't even break the fall with my hands it happened so fast. He moved out for awhile.  Made promises to work on his anger issues and find steady employment.  Neither of these things have improved. I work my tail off commuting an hour each way then working 60 to 70 hour weeks just trying to make ends meet. My car needs so much work it's dangerous to drive.  He has laid on the couch for all of last week and two days this week when we have bills up the wazoo due to his lack of steady income.  He works for his friend so basically when he feels like it.

domesticviolence,"Me[24F] and my boyfriend[35M] have been together for 7 long years. His temper has escalated over the years and he began physically abusing me about 4 years ago. 

I fell into a really bad suicidal depression about 2 years ago because I lost the support of my friends and family due to me choosing to stay with him and on top of that I was pregnant and miscarried at 16 weeks. 

I hated him at the time but once he saw how depressed I was, he eased up and became that hero in my life again. He was loving and caring. He showed me that he was all I needed in this world and I fell for his evil ways again. This honeymoon phase only last about 6 months and he was right back to beating my face in. 

Recently I‚Äôve found myself become more and more numb to getting hit. It still physically hurts but not like it used to. I emotionally feel NOTHING when he hits me now. In the past, I would always feel an aching pain in my heart and have hurt feelings but now I feel no way about it and I just want to sleep it away. I literally just go lay down and fall asleep. 

I don‚Äôt speak to him at all anymore unless he speaks to me. I don‚Äôt ask him for anything anymore and I just don‚Äôt trust him overall. Everything he does and has done for me emotionally, financially, etc. is calculated. Somehow it‚Äôll be thrown in my face and used as leverage to hurt me emotionally or physically. 

I‚Äôm honestly scared that I will fall back into that state of depression I was in and I don‚Äôt want that. I can tell that he‚Äôs noticed my change and he‚Äôs trying to be that nice guy again.

Idk if I hope that he‚Äôll love me or what but it makes no sense and I can‚Äôt understand it. 

He says that he wants me to have his child soon and to marry me but I am sure that this is calculated too. This is the thing that hurts my feelings the most, is that he only wants me to have his child and marry him because he wants to have leverage on me. Also that after being with him for all of these years how can he not love me or at least respect me a little more. Like how after 7 years can someone not at least care for someone who‚Äôs been loving and genuine with them to some capacity. 

I don‚Äôt get why I love and care so much for someone who I know doesn‚Äôt care for me. I literally know all his games and tactics and I still want him. I feel like I‚Äôm my own worst enemy.

domesticviolence,"Hello, Sorry for the poor english

I live in a condo in Paris (France)My upper neighboor is a women (50) with her son ( 18 y) . The ""husban"" (they are separated since 5 year, not divorced but he live with another women somewhere else) still pay the rent and health insurance of the women, who never work ( first he didn't want she work, and now she is too old and in too poor health both physique and mental to help.

They all are in a very complex financial and abuse  and mental health situation.

Often I ear extrem yells of the women, who force me to come and try to fix the situation. Half of the time it's serious issue ( empty bank account, financial bailif and so one), but the other half it's extremly small things ( someone did'nt say ""hy"" to here in the stair. someone else have stole her magazine in the post box)

If I don't go upstair to calm her, after a few hour her son sometimes end-up beat her and bite her.  She often can move one of her arm because of that.

She have ask me to not call the cops about it.

So I come up to try to calm her. And it take HOURs . Specially for the small things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm exhausted by the situation. It's been like that for year, way before we start living here. And I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm legally obligated to do.She is already followed by a psy but it's very inefficient and some of her medoc make her paranoid. She refuse the ask the help of a social assistant or a cops.

What can I do?  


One of the difficulty is the son : He become violent when he reach the end of his rope.  I know the whole "" don't blame the victime of domestic abuse"" and I will never tell them that, but it's obvious that the mum is responsible of the violent access and other things.  He is obviously too young for the whole thing, and the only reason why I didn't report him to protective service is become he start living at it's grand's father home around 15 y old( they die shortly after he reach 18 so he cannot live here anymore).  


He cannot financially live anywhere else, but also he prevent multiple time the mother try to end her life and cook and clean for her. Yes he is abusive but the mother cannot obviously live alone. The mental condition of her mother have a serious effect on him.  


The father still pay the bills and live somewhere else. I never meet him, I cannot tell if he is also abusive ( what she say he was/still is) or just overtaken by the whole things.

So I know that what happened was domestic violence (I think) but I'm not sure if I am to blame for what happened because I also hit him..and he only pushed me. So I think I'm the one who did the violence ? 

My fiance and I are kind of Christian.. we do live together but we're not getting married until June. We were also waiting until marriage to have sex. (It's just what i wanted to do please no judgement) 

I thought him and I were on the same page this whole time but apparently not because yesterday he'd tried to initiate sex. This very much upset me because I thought he knew my desire to save that for our wedding day. I ended up walking out on him and he became a little angry I guess. He'd shoved me back into the room quite harshly and was beginning to yell about how I just up and left the room. I told him calmly that he should not have just pushed me. He continued yelling and pushed me again and I bumped my head on the wall that time. I became angry and banged my fist on his chest, hard enough he had to step backwards and hold his chest. 

I immediately regretted what I did because he looked like he was actually in some pain. I said sorry about a thousand times I was actually very sorry and I did feel bad. I knew what I did was wrong of me. 

He ended up walking out after and that only made me feel worse. While he was gone I had a bit of a nap and he ended up coming back while I was napping. He climbed in next to me while I was napping I was awake enough to know he was there but still to tired to open my eyes. He layed there with me for a bit but I only completely woke up when I realised he was putting his penis inside me. I was freaked out but I was still feeling so much shame and guilt from hitting him in the chest I just laid there and let him have sex with me to make myself feel better about hitting him. It only lasted a minute or two but now I feel even worse because that's not how I wanted it to happen and I feel like I've let myself down. 

We're still set to get married in June but now I don't know if I still want to. I feel so miserable ? I don't want to do anything.

domesticviolence,"I've posted on here a couple of times about how I've broken up with an ex recently who I live with who was verbally and emotionally abusive. Immediately afterward I felt amazing, but since then it's been a struggle and has been getting increasingly harder.

Since breaking up, he has told our friends he thinks we'll get back together and has asked for advice on how to win me back. He wrote me a letter apologizing for ""his part of the arguments"" and explaining he didn't mean to scare me etc, and I responded telling him that I need space. A couple of days later he sent me a message telling me that his friend is in trouble and he wants to help her, I'm the only person who will give good advice etc. I responded with some resources for her and said he should ask them how he can help her, but that I can't give him specific advice.

I'm pretty certain both of these things are tactics to win me back. He hasn't accepted the breakup yet because he doesn't think it's genuine. He's doing these things to break my resolve, not because he actually cares. I feel like he's probably told friends that don't know me that I'm crazy etc and has tried to make me look bad. I'd be very surprised if he came from a place of genuine concern for his friend and honestly, I feel like it might be totally fabricated from him.

It's really difficult to stay away because it goes against my instincts. I have always been a very loving and forgiving person and it's somewhat of a gift and a curse but I forget and move on very quickly when people mistreat me. The further I get from the abuse, the less bothered I am by the fact that it happened, and it's so much harder to stay away from him when I'm not angry. The parts that I hold onto are the loving parts and those make me miss him.

When I think about my ex before him (who wasn't abusive), I realize what I and my (recent, abusive) ex had was no comparison. It's such a clear difference to me between a genuinely loving and abusive relationship. I want what me and my (non-abusive) ex had again, but with someone else. And the fact I've gone so long with such a crappy substitute for it makes me feel very lonely.

I live with him and in many ways want to be close to him again, but that would include so much stuff that is detrimental to me, so I can't do it. I need to be with someone that's good to me which means being by myself for now until I'm ready. But I'm so scared and I feel so lonely.

domesticviolence,"Twice now I have heard my apartment neighbours having heated arguments, and the first time I heard a bloody-murder-type scream from the girl, and the second time (tonight) I heard lots of raised voices and banging noises for 7 or 8 minutes, along with the girl saying ""ow"" and the guy saying ""f\*\*\* you"" followed by a loud bang.

Both times I have called the police, told them exactly what I heard, and both times they've taken it really seriously and gone and talked to this couple. However, each time the police leave empty handed and immediately after they leave everything seems to be peachy with the couple (laughing, joking, etc.).

Tonight the police followed up with me, and asked me VERY clearly if I was sure there was a girl in the apartment. I said that I had seen them literally two minutes before the cops had arrived (I was waiting outside the building and saw them taking their dog outside), and that I was sure it was a man and a woman. The cop told me he wanted to double check because when they went in to talk, there was only the man and a young boy who was apparently his little brother, no sign of the girl. The officer told me that their story was they like to play wrestle, and that they were unaware they were making so much noise. This guy had seen me in the hallway, going to get the mail, just after I had called the police, and my girlfriend who was still in the apartment said she overheard the guy sounding really angry and talking about me (""this f\*\*\*er saw me looking at him in the hallway""). So the cop reassured me that they told the guy there were multiple calls and that I was not the guy who called, but I still feel like he knows.

Essentially, I'm really concerned for this girl, and now for my own safety, as I think the fact that the girl was conveniently gone after just having been there 3 minutes before the cops showed up says a lot about the situation. Just wondering, is there anything I can do to make sure the cops catch this guy in the act, or at least have a better chance of bringing him in, or is it kinda up to the girl to come forward?

I told her to call the police but she said she was going to talk to an advocate instead. I spent the day ruminating about it, wondering what I should do. I talked to her later that evening and of course, everything was fine again and she wasn‚Äôt going to reach out for help. I hit MY breaking point. I called the police. I sent them the photos. He was arrested and charged with four felonies. 

Now, I‚Äôm dealing with the backlash. She told me to die slowly, along with various other names. Her mother has even defended her husband and helped bail him out of jail and is speaking incredibly poorly about me. I might have to testify if he goes to trial, and I don‚Äôt know if I can do that. I‚Äôm terrified to face so many people that are so angry with me. 

I know what I did was right. I know I potentially saved her life but this is so much worse than I could have imagined. And the worst part is, I was a domestic violence advocate for 7 years.

domesticviolence,"I thought I finally got an opportunity to at least get back home to my family for next month. He promised my mom that he was buying a plane ticket so that I could see my family. I was so excited but obviously it was all a damn lie. He told me that we had to stay at his mom's house. Well his family have been incredibly nasty to me. I've been called a prostitute by his brother. Have been pushed by his sister because I told her she needs to call before coming over unannounced. Been embarrassed and consistently belittled by his mom..she's incredibly controlling over his family just like he is to me. I told him I didn't feel comfortable staying with them and of course my plane is cancelled I cannot go see my family now. Though my logic tells me I probably would not have been allowed to see them anyways even if we did fly out there. He told me to fuck off and proceeded to scream at me like I was a dog. I told him to stop treating me like a dog and he said I deserved it cause I dont listen to him otherwise. He said if I didn't make him angry he would t have to treat me the way he does. I'm apparently suppose to take responsibility for all my faults and when I asked him what his were his response was ""none, you always start everything"". I'm sitting here with my dog alone.

domesticviolence,"Am I wrong for getting upset my boyfriend(23) pinned me(22) down during a huge fight and screamed awful things in my face?

All of my friends are telling me this is wrong, but Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs warranted. Me and my BF have been together on and off for 10 years, it was a super toxic 10 years, but we were like addicted to each other. He has always had a big temper, but he never touched me. (The one girl he dated in between ended up filing a police report against him but she broke it by talking to him again) I used to be bigger because I was a D1 athlete and was incredible strong, he told me at the time years ago I‚Äôd be a model if I didn‚Äôt have a fucked up chin and if my legs and stomach were smaller. I hated him after that. His best friend was my best friend as well and he was there for me through the breakup, we ended up having sex three times in a few month span. And I did something really fucked up but I didn‚Äôt like or respect my ex bf and he wasn‚Äôt in my life anymore and never thought he would be again.
Fast forward two years ago, I started getting really sick and got diagnosed with Crohns Disease, we hadn‚Äôt talk in months and he somehow wiggled his way into my life and he changed and became the best man and boyfriend I could ask for. He asked me multiple times if I had sex with his friend and I said no for fear of him losing his best friend and his friend and me agreed to just leave it in the past. For the last 1.5 years it‚Äôs ate me alive and I was never able to fully love him properly because of the lie. It got to the point I refused to lie to him, and the man he became deserves the truth. 

So I told him, and it ended up snatching my beanie from my head and him pushing me down then again when I was on the ground screaming at me. He‚Äôs calling me every name in the book like disgusting Whore, filthy slut etc, and then the next day he found something else out and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm confused. 

HERES THE PART IM CONFLICTED OVER


So I had a blanket over my face as he was screaming and he ripped it away and pushed me backwards while pinning me to the ground screaming ‚Äúyou better fucking tell me what else you fucking slut‚Äù and I just told him everything I could think of just to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss something. Then he called me a Whore  He then slapped me lightly on the cheek enough it was kinda red, and I had bruises on my wrists. Granted I did this, I told him. I used to be a slut but since changed my whole life around. Later he said he went to snatch my bun and ‚Äú I moved my head so I need to stop saying he slapped me‚Äù I then once again just kept getting called filthy worthless Whore and stuff but I just brushed it off even when after wards he said ‚Äúif I find out you lied I‚Äôm going into that kitchen and stabbing you multiple times and I don‚Äôt care what happens to me‚Äù when he calmed down he apologized for saying that and said he didn‚Äôt mean it, he told me it won‚Äôt happen again unless he ever finds out I cheated, and that he doesn‚Äôt apologize for anything. I stayed at his place for a month taking all the degrading, shameful words and I believe still it‚Äôs my fault cause he‚Äôs said so many times if I didn‚Äôt do that none of this would have happened to me, and he still thinks I‚Äôm the Abuser here and told me again this is my fault. I took time yesterday and knew if we kept having sex with him looking at me as a whore neither of us will heal since sex caused this. I asked him for us to take a month break so we can rebuild our relationship emotionally and gain trust back, but he told me ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not getting your p$$$y you‚Äôre not cuddling me or getting my lips‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo guys okay with just staying at second base‚Äù
‚Äú I‚Äôm 23 and live alone I can be getting bitches now‚Äù I really want to try and work on getting us back to how we were, but he said again none of this is on him. And I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs right and I should just let it go because what I did in jun 2018 was awful. My best friend who is his cousin is even telling me to leave and it‚Äôs not right, but I don‚Äôt know if this is really abuse because it‚Äôs warranted for the situation right?","My boyfriend(23) is saying pinning me(22) down and pushing me on the ground is warranted for the situation, is it my fault?",rainb0wfissh,2020-03-09 14:56:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ffvvl6/my_boyfriend23_is_saying_pinning_me22_down_and/,10,1.0,7,22,832
domesticviolence,"Hi, this is my first time posting, and I feel insane. So here‚Äôs my shpeal. 

I‚Äôve grown up in a very dysfunctional family. My dad was the one who glued our family together, and if any of us got in my mom‚Äôs face, swore at her, pushed her, we would be dead. If my brothers were to lay a hand on my sister or I, they would be dead. Sadly, my dad passed away in September from terminal cancer. Things have spiraled since he passed. 

My family is being torn apart by my older brother and his freak outs. He would always get irrational and delusional and angry. That was normal. He would get in aggressive fights with my twin brother over something small and would break tables and other things. That was normal. To me at least. When they would get bad, I would throw myself in the middle of them to stop them from sending eachother to the hospital and I would get banged and pushed around. Bruised up. That was normal, to me at least. My older brother would come home belligerently drunk raging pissed, and would break everything in sight and I would wake up to blood splattered around my house. That was normal. I thought that was normal. 

But within the past few weeks, things have turned physical. It was normal for him to push me hard to the floor or bed when I would instinctively get inbetween him and my mom when he was yelling in her face and breaking things the room. But this week, it‚Äôs become bad. Two sundays ago around 11 at night, my twin brother turned off the power to reboot it, and my older brother got triggered because he interrupted his game and came after him and started yelling in his face. Which this is how their fights always begin. Over something small and dumb. It then moved to upstairs. I swear they were going to kill eachother this time, and I instinctively threw myself inbetween them and I got banged around pretty bad and have a few bruises from it. Then last Tuesday, my mom told him no to taking her car for the night and he had his usual tantrum. Things escalated when she figured out he was lying about where he was going to go, and he got PISSED. He started getting in my mom‚Äôs face, and began breaking everything in the room, stopping himself multiple times from hitting her. I recorded him to send it to my twin brother so he could actually see what happens when he‚Äôs not around. (My mom always lies about what happens when my twin asks her about it.) So I decided to record it, to show him I‚Äôm not being dramatic and that I‚Äôm actually telling the truth. My older brother noticed I was recording him and started using force against me and was pinning me down to get my phone. My mom had to peel him off multiple times, and I swear if she wasn‚Äôt around he would‚Äôve done worse things to me. He had the most evil look on his face and was breathing heavily staring me down. My arms are bruised from that night. Yesterday my older sister asked him to come down and do the dishes he used, and he flipped. He started pushing her against the wall and punched her so hard in the back, and her back was messed up and has scrapes and bruises. 

Is any of this normal? My mom likes to think it is, and always forgives and forgets and told me if I tell the police, that would hurt her more than anything.

So last night, I came home from work, a fight broke out, and I decided to leave and never come back. I‚Äôm broke, no longer have a car, and my best friend and her mom have taken me in. Bless them.

But, my family thinks I‚Äôm being over dramatic, and think I‚Äôm causing issues by speaking about this. Making me out to seem crazy for thinking this isn‚Äôt right or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior.",Am I insane?,embrew331,2020-03-10 01:04:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fg5js3/am_i_insane/,2,0.67,1,3,684
domesticviolence,"I am at home now, but am scared and shaken. 

I live with my sister. We work together. I got involved with a man 20 years older than me. We work together. No one knows about it but we have been ""dating"" for 10 months. I had a key to his place. We said we love eachother. He has been very manipulative. I know he has followed me. I don't know if he knows where I live now. We just moved. He knows where my ex and I used to live. He knows where my sister and I work since we all work together. We have had a rough ""relationship"" with a lot of trust issues. He has given me reason to believe that he was cheating. While he was asleep, I made the stupid choice to take his phone and leave. I saw he was talking to a lot of women-one who he said was his ex but from reading texts she still believes they are together. He was having sex with a lot of women. When I got back, he was outside. I ran inside to get my stuff and leave his phone. My stuff was not there. He ran in and started pushing me, holding me down, pulling my hair, hit me in my face telling me to give him his phone. It felt numb but there is only a scratch on the inside from my tooth hitting my lip where he hit me. He almost threw me down the stairs. I gave him his phone. I told him to give me my stuff. He said give me his key. I took it off the keyring and said give me my stuff and I will give you your key. He chased me around outside and a neighbor saw us. He grabbed a big rock and made holes and dents on my car and tried to bust the windows. I recorded him while he had the rock but my phone died before I could get footage of him hitting my car. He finally showed me where my stuff was and when I was grabbing it the key fell somewhere. He told me to find it while he kept hitting my car. I had the chance to run for my car and he chased me. I drove off while he ran and continued trying to bust the windows and hit my car. Even when I waited for the gate to open. While I was driving I called the number of the ""long distance girlfriend"" who has been manipulated just like I have. He was visiting her a couple times a month while we were together. I called her twice. She didnt answer. and he called me to say that I am calling numbers from his phone now. I said no. I think she called him and told him my number called her phone because we are from the same area in Nevada. I stopped calling her. I called him and told him we need to figure out how we are going to proceed since we work together and that we both need to stay away from eachother. He said he called the cops because I stole his property and sensitive information and that they will be at my work in the morning. He knows what time I work. I am scared. I know he has stalked me. He knows what I drive. I dont know if he will try to follow my sister. She doesnt know about anything. I am scared I will get in trouble with the police for taking his phone. I took pics of what I saw in his texts but deleted it all. What do I do? I am shaken right now and cannot think.",Tonight,odinactahw,2020-03-09 12:43:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ffu2kq/tonight/,4,1.0,2,1,630

I can even delete this post if need be and post it in the other section if required. 

To give you some hindsight, I live at home with a very abusive, manipulative, rather controlling family member, who on the odd occasion, has made it clear that she will ""run a knife through me"". There was an incident a month or so back where things got super abusive, I left the house went on a walk for about an hour or so called the police, in the end they attended my place and spoke with the person making the threats .. since I live at home with them they basically did nothing and told me to move out .. 

Which is exactly what I'm trying to do, BUT, after that happened she has made it clear that if the cops are called to the house again, that she will pick up a knife and run me through ..

domesticviolence,"A couple days ago my court services rep (not lawyer, but someone assigned by the city to explain the court process for assault cases) asked me what the best outcome for this case would be, in my opinion.  I'm still trying to figure out what I want.  My boyfriend was charged for 2 counts of sexual assault and 1 count each of assault, unlawful confinement, and threatening to kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, there was over a year of rape, which occurred every month to every two weeks.  Sometimes those were done in addition to physical assault.  Also, he didn't pay rent for almost a  year and owes me maybe 20k.  

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand, I believe he can get better with proper therapy and lots of work.  Will he do the work?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I don't believe that jail time or a criminal record will help.  We are Canadian and Canadians with records have trouble crossing the border, and he has family in the US so I don't want to deprive him of that.  Also, a criminal record could affect his future job prospects because he wants to work in finance.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if they do this in real life, but are there court-mandated therapy, anger management, and consent classes?  Or is that just on TV?  Should I be so concerned about the criminal record?  After all, he did break the law, many times.  Can I ask for the money he owes me?

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone, new to this sub but I've been reading up as much as I can about DV since earlier this week, when I found out a family member's husband was arrested for DV.

At least for me, (cant speak for other family members) but I was shocked he was abusing her. Maybe I'm not experienced enough with relationships to see it, but it was a huge surprise to me.

I found out that she was being hit for a year and a half before she told anybody, and there was emotional abuse/manipulation going on before this. The hitting started when their first child was born. My family member is (very) pregnant again with their second child, so the safety of their unborn child (and other child!) is something I'm very concerned about as well. 

The turning point for the arrest was the choking. He hit her, she ran into the other room and he chased her, started choking her and would not give her phone back so she could call the police and have him arrested. She grabbed their child and was able to run out and have a neighbor call 911. 

I was reading here and will continue to read here to cope and for support. The choking scares me so much.  I was reading a post on here that suggests evidence that choking has a high chance of escalating into homicidal behavior. That is so scary to me! 

I am also afraid, because mental illness runs in our family (myself included) and I know from experience that having a mental illness can sometimes lead to illogical, self destructive and victimizing thought patterns and I dont want my family member being taken advantage by him of because of this. For example, she has a RO but also bailed him out when he would have spent time in jail for the arrest. The psychology behind that scares me! I really really hope that she never contacts him again but I know that it is common to go back to someone.

Any advice or encouragement on how to cope with a family member dealing with something so awful would be amazing.

domesticviolence,"I need in help in trying to convince my sister to leave this relationship! 
She started dating this boy 18 who wasn‚Äôt originally from the community but had mutual friendships with our family. (Our community is very close and everyone is basically connected or related in someway) 
So I initially knew of him through my cousin (1) who I worked with, she always hung out with him etc. So basically they were a thing, but then it kind of broke off because she told me that he was on ICE (meth). As I didn‚Äôt even know the guy I was like oh that sucks, plus ICE use is very common in my community. 
I then found out he was dating my other cousin (2) (close friendship with my sister), she was a drug user as well. That‚Äôs when I learned that he was abusive because she came out and told people this. 
But then he started dating my sister, so you could imagine my reaction to this. This then started a major conflict with cousin (2), online bullying posts about sloppy seconds
And asking why would you want to be with a crack head woman basher etc. etc. 
Eventually this was a foundation of mistrust, my sister thinking he would go back to cousin 2. As the weeks went on my sister basically moved out into his caravan that was parked behind the family house who looked after him, she lost weight due to heavy drug use (party drugs mostly), she had no money all time (even though she worked full time, and didn‚Äôt pay rent, bills, groceries). 
So basically she‚Äôs going down hill. 
THEN I found out that she posted on her private Instagram of her concerns that he was becoming abusive towards her (she stated that he scruffed her because he was paranoid she was texting under the blanket) she dismissed this as ‚ÄúI guess it wasn‚Äôt his fault he was off his head‚Äù (btw all they did was take pills in the caravan and lay around). 
I became suspicious to the fact that she might have tried ICE with him (my sister is easily influenced). 
This was a major thing especially to the fact my eldest sister was a heavy drug user eg ice heroin and 2 years prior she attempted to murder my mother while I was at school. 
This angered me because it was a massive slap in the face for me and my mum. That this world of ice is impacting our life again. 
She then turned 18, she put on this party out the road in a hall, basically was a drug fest. As she was high on ketamine, she kissed another boy. (Yes her boyfriend was at the party) 
They had a fight he kicked her out of the caravan. 
My sister then told our older cousins at work about him and how he scruffed her. She also contacted the family where he was staying in the caravan. SHE TOLD THEM HE WAS SMOKING CRACK IN THE CARAVAN AMD TOLD THEM WHERE HE KEEPS HIS PIPE. 
She is now back at home, THIS JUST RAISED MY SUSPICION MORE. Also during this time her behaviour was jacked -she had no memory of conversations and acted with paranoia. Also hanging around community members known for harbouring and dealing ice. As I didn‚Äôt want a massive fight to break out I was working with our cousin (3) to speak to her (they were very close, tell each other everything) 
My sister would deny deny deny, even turned on cousin (3) for insinuating she does crack and tried to convince her the boyfriend quit a long time ago. I could see right through also I knew he was on ice the year prior. Also he was best friends with 3 guys I knew from high school that were convicted users and traffickers. 
So now my sister used this accusation in a mocking way, because it was so shocking! Anyone who didn‚Äôt know the inside scoop would also be like SHE WOULD NEVER DO CRACK WTF LIES! 
Anyway, our older male cousins were furious and threatened to get the boyfriend as they also knew he was abusive to cousin (2). My sister pleaded with them no no I was lying and then turned on them. She then told our cousins she broke up with him just to deflate the situation. She also told our brothers but the next day shut them out, and made my mum turn on them as well. She then complained about how everyone was chiming in but forgot she was the one who told these people. 
Our cousins drove passed our house and saw his car in our driveway and screamed out something. My sister then cut them off fully. 
I then started talking to my mum further, I was trying to give her hints about what‚Äôs happening but I didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm her because she has gone through extreme trauma (from DV) and has PTSD. Me hinting would set her off, she didn‚Äôt want to hear it. Plus she didn‚Äôt see what I saw, which made it hard. 
They are now both living at home, she is always miserable, never leaving the room, room is a pigsty etc. 
they are always fighting and hitting each other, she stated that she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal because he hits because she hits him right back. All done within the walls of her room. 
I keep telling my mum this isn‚Äôt right, I think he on ice. She obviously doesn‚Äôt know what to do. Tension became overwhelming in the house, I started staying at my Nan‚Äôs house just to escape it. 
One time we borrowed his car ( I always told mum aren‚Äôt you scared driving this car? You don‚Äôt know who is after him ) this was a genuine concern. WHICH THEN BECAME REAL. We were parked behind the supermarket and when we came out this dodgy ute (truck) was parked all the behind us, bumper to bumper. It had all this bikie stickers and sayings on it. I just rolled my eyes. The guy came out and was like ‚Äúwhere is he‚Äù and we are like wtf. My mum was like fuck this shit and rang my sister to get her man on the phone. So they are talking and the  sketchy dude is asking for his money and asking for the car back. The dude explained that my sister‚Äôs boyfriend didn‚Äôt own the car or the tyres and owed the guy 1000$. My mind was like ~clearly drug related~.
I thought this was it! Like my mum and sister are gonna get this bloke out of the house. 
No. 
And I don‚Äôt know why. 
Next thing we know, my sister ends up in hospital. She tried to OD on Panadol. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I was like what is it actually going to take. I‚Äôm hearing different stories, she was drinking with her close friend and then she took her hospital. Few days after I still didn‚Äôt know what happened. I concluded this was a massive cry for help, I don‚Äôt think she wanted to die, because honestly if she did she would. She had access to pills, ket and stronger stuff. But she went with Panadol? Remind you, she denies she does drugs, so I also thought that‚Äôs why she chose Panadol. I didn‚Äôt want to think it but I kind of thought it was a cry for help and guilt because she probably did use ice with him. And I did say to my self and cousin 3 if I found out she did use it , she‚Äôs done. 
So then I found out, her story she had told to staff and friends. She alleged her suicide attempt was because of our family and that everyone picks on her. This was SO UNTRUE, honestly our family is riddled with trauma and pain but in THIS MOMENT how could it not be her boyfriend that fuelled her attempt. My sister always used this angle, that her siblings bully her. I don‚Äôt know about the others my I gave her nothing but love. But when she became more difficult, I became more harsh, in the sense of becoming more blatant. I would never bully her ever. I just gave her it‚Äôs this way or the highway tone. 
I was confused also, that with this attempt she never told any of her reasonably good friends about it, she told people that had no friendship or relationships with, just acquaintances. 
I just thought maybe because she‚Äôs not telling the truth? Maybe her true ~friends~ would know maybe it was because of her boyfriend. 
Fast forward, I learn that her BF was the one who picked her up from the hospital. She then  went out the following night, seeking drugs with him. 
At this moment of time it‚Äôs a massive WTF and I give up. Also by the fact her closer friends were questioning why is she back with him, her answer was I don‚Äôt want to go home. And stating things like I wish her BF did get bashed by our cousins. This was very much a personal attack, how can that piece of shit of a boy be better than being at home with your family. 
Time goes by and she‚Äôs doing crazy shit. They all were drinking and they went driving in his car, she was took over and crashed and rolled the car. She gave her friend the biggest gash down her temple. My sister is so stubborn she cannot admit to her bad decisions. I was pissed off, she could of died and killed her friend? But she turned it into a funny story to tell and brag about (no doubt led by her BF) she even admitted she had nightmares for days over it. 
That situation escalated, when learning the car was due to be destroyed by the police due to the BF being caught under the influence of drugs and also unlicensed couple months prior. She came home and said it was from speeding, nothing about the car being impounded. 
Her behaviour is so reckless - she can‚Äôt see it though. 
Next episode they have a fist fight out the front while heading downtown to the pub, I go off at her. I asked her to get the piece of shit out of the house, she was laughing while our nan was freaking out in the spare room. She even went to leave to go to the pub and I said what you gonna have a domestic and then leave us here with him? She said he is a pussy.
Next day she puts all his bags and clothes out the front. I was thinking ok maybe this thing is over. She‚Äôs celebrating and joking, she then says he‚Äôs been awake all night probably on crack. I was like wtf, because how many times does she deny that. I go to dinner come back that evening, he is back in the house. It only lasted a full 5 hours.
I was pissed again like wtf, all she could do is laugh. His behaviour was also strange, following her into the kitchen and bathroom literally 20cm between them. 
I share my disbelief with my mum, but I know nothing is going to come of it. I‚Äôm frequently staying with my nan now. Home is a nightmare. 
Late last year she gained most her wait back on and things died down. I thought maybe everything is smoothing out but I knew obviously something is going to happen. She became more vocal to our cousin (3) about leaving him and not loving him anymore. She was clearly aware of the things that were wrong. She was sick of going to work, spending all her money, coming back to a messy room, his paranoia. 
I have recently moved out, she took my room. Last night they were heading out, drinking and doings drugs (she even sent me an accidental snap) I woke this morning to texts saying what happened to my sister. I WAS LIKE WTF. They had a physical fight at the bar, in front of everyone. She was catching up with some male friends for school. He became jealous and pushed her around and everyone came to intervene. She then posted on Facebook asking where her family are and why aren‚Äôt they helping her. That she is sick of missing work because of him and that she even tried to kill her self over him. 
How can I help her? 
What do I do? When I know what is say is going over her head? 
I know 100% he will be back tonight or tomorrow. 
How can I make her realise that she won‚Äôt lose nothing leaving him! HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW

domesticviolence,"I don't even know where to start. . . But I guess here it goes. I met my girlfriend a few years ago, she was still married at the time, which was not a big deal because I frankly didn't really care that much. We matched well, started to become good friends, ended up meeting her husband, and. . . after a while everything started to slowly unravel. It turned out that he was a violent, narcissistic person, and that she had been a victim for quite a long while, and eventually he nearly choked her to death and broke some of her ribs. A couple of weeks before that, we were at her home, and I saw him ramping up and I told him to stop, and he assaulted me instead.

Thankfully nothing serious happened, but it was a pretty awful experience. He was charged both times, and those cases are currently pending. During this whole time, we had made plans to get her divorced and away from him, and to find a way to protect all of our children from this monster. move in together when everything was said and done, which would require some significant financial planning on our ends, as well as some planning on how child custody and that sort of thing would be. 

After the event where she was nearly killed, an emergency protection order was placed against him, and this was where all of our troubles together began.  We discussed our future plans together, and she agreed that she wanted to have full custodial privileges while he had visitation (I fought against him having any sort of unsupervised visitation, but due to the abusive mental conditioning this was a compromise she was comfortable with.) There's a hearing about whether or not to keep the order in place, and she goes, and says that she maintained the order, much to my relief.  However, when he's been sending her threatening messages and other vile filth (she shows me of her own volition,) I tell her that she needs to contact the police and explain that he's making threats and contacting her in violation of the PO. She says it's not a big deal, and then I say I'll do it then. And that's when I find out that she lied to me about keeping the protection order in place.

I was a little upset that I was lied to about such a crucially important detail, especially when we're planning on buying a house together and keeping things safe for everyone. I offer to help her with the divorce paperwork, since her finances are obliterated due to his financial abuse as well, and she tells me that would be great. She never takes me up on it, even though I asked her to E-mail them to me to look them over so she could be as safe and secure as possible. She conveniently forgot, and I trusted that she did the right thing. Later on, I find the decree on the floor of her vehicle as we are getting ready to turn in for the night, and I start reading it over and discover that she agreed to joint-custody. I talk to her about it, and she says it must have been an accident because she remembers switching the papers beforehand. I'm suspicious because of the previous lie pertaining to the EPO, but I let it go because the guy is going up for a felony and is likely to be seeing the inside of a cell anyway, and at that point her safety apart from him can be secured.

Eventually, a hearing for her ex-husband is coming up, and she is adamant about not sending him to prison. I, of course, am flabbergasted by this, as this is literally her only chance to put him away and obtain full custody of her children to ensure her and their long-term safety. We have a very emotional argument, and eventually I learn that she lied to me about the divorce decree as well, which put me in a very, very, very difficult position.

I told her that she lied to me, twice, in order to protect her abuser, about things that matter a lot to our future plans and that I can no longer trust her to do what is right for US. It was hard to say, because I care about her a lot, and I KNOW that what she wants and what she does are tainted by her years and years and years of hoping that he would get better and stop beating her, emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. I understand that overcoming that is hard, but that trust that we shared, has been unceremoniously shattered. Needless to say, she went to the hearing anyway prepared to testify against him, supposedly.

I know that being patient is critical, and I understand how difficult it is, but everything we wanted together is at risk because of these things that have happened. I feel angry at him for doing what he has done, how his abuse has caused someone I love to betray me, and how bad things had to get before she realized that she has to stop protecting him from himself at the cost of our relationship. I want to give her time to rebuild the trust that we had, but that time is running out. There are things in motion that were timed specifically based upon the things we had discussed, custody, moving in together, and him being a footnote as opposed to a constant threat to the stability of our lives. She's made concrete steps, like getting a therapist to help her, agreeing that I should be there, and that sort of thing. But I am terrified that she's going to do it again, and as much as we do care about one another, I know that I cannot make her want to heal and be free. She has to do that. I just don't know how to cope with the possibility of her relapsing and/or lying to me again in regards to this. (These are the only things she has ever lied to me about, to my knowledge.)

It's so damn hard, and I want us to be able to move forward. . . but I guess time will tell. :(",Dealing with the Fallout of a Loved One's Abuser,Desthr0,2020-03-06 22:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/felo16/dealing_with_the_fallout_of_a_loved_ones_abuser/,35,1.0,9,9,1055
domesticviolence,"I wrote a post a few days ago detailing my situation living with a boyfriend who turned out to be abusive

[https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fctet0/i\_live\_with\_my\_abuser\_and\_two\_friends\_i\_need\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fctet0/i_live_with_my_abuser_and_two_friends_i_need_to/)

After four days of the silent treatment (literally not saying a word to me) to punish me on top of a verbally abusive and aggressive outburst, we finally spoke. He tried lots of tactics to weaken me and then jump on me and what I'd done to provoke him, and eventually, he broke up with me. He was really surprised when I agreed readily to the breakup, instead of begging him to take me back, and that I'd already moved all my things from his room when he wasn't home.

Straight afterward I felt amazing. I felt like I'd regained all the power I've felt myself losing over the last 9 months, and I felt free. I felt really lucky that I got out early before any more damage could be done to me. I woke up before 12pm for the first time in probably two weeks the next day and was on a high. But then some family stuff happened and it brought me crashing down. I've come to rely on him and I don't have his emotional support in other areas of my life anymore. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm strong enough to get through this alone, and have written a list of all my unhealthy thoughts about him, and corrected them (a technique I learned in CBT for depression). I'm also making a playlist full of songs that make me feel empowered, and I'm not talking to him at all.

I'm kind of worried about retaliation. I feel scared that the more fulfilled and happy I feel, the unhappier he will be to see that. Friends have told me he was asking for advice on how to win me back (although this was one day after the breakup to be fair) and he's voiced fears that I will try to ""get revenge"" for the breakup (probably by being honest about how he treated me). Before we broke up I was scared of the risk of physical violence, and I'm less scared now, but still very anxious about it sometimes.

I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the situation?",Update - I broke up with my abusive live-in ex boyfriend,_silly_billy_,2020-03-06 15:35:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fef4we/update_i_broke_up_with_my_abusive_livein_ex/,3,0.95,25,11,372
domesticviolence,"My sister and her ex husband have been through a lot. He cheated on her with multiple women &amp; had a child with another woman. My sister already has low self esteem from abuse &amp; issues from the past. For 2 years she‚Äôs been dating this abusive guy (I‚Äôve never seen the abuse but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happening). After she was divorced she IMMEDIATELY started dating this man. She‚Äôs so eager to be with anybody who will ‚Äúlove‚Äù her. He‚Äôs very cocky and always telling my sister what to do. I do not like him at all.

I believe she‚Äôs being abused because whenever I go to pick up my nieces, she stays on the phone with me and when I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pulling up‚Äù she makes my neices (5, 3 and 2 years old) stand outside and she won‚Äôt come outside or she‚Äôll just wave her hand through the front door without showing her face. I have asked my nieces have they seen him hit their mom and they said yes and when I ask her she just says that they were arguing and the girls were scared. One day  when we were arguing she even told me to mind my business and even ‚Äúif‚Äù that‚Äôs the way her man handles her then that‚Äôs just that. I‚Äôm really worried about them. 

I guess my sisters ex husband has had the same exact experience with her leaving the kids outside and staying inside when he comes to pick them up. He told me when he complained to her about doing that and questioned her, she said that he can no longer come to her house and she now drops the kids off at his moms. She sits in the car and lets the kids walk to the door. I 100% think she‚Äôs hiding bruises. 

Her ex told her he wants full custody of the children and that me and him have been worried about her and the children. My sister flew off the handle and told me she hates me because I put him up to this and she wanted to know why I didn‚Äôt tell her I was talking to him. So now I have no contact  with my sister or nieces. The only time I can see them is if they‚Äôre at my moms house and my sister isn‚Äôt there. 

I am not AT ALL fond of my sister ex husband, especially being that he hurt &amp; disrespected my sister (&amp; is JUST like her new boyfriend minus the physical abuse) so bad that she contemplated suicide and he lowered her self esteem even more. Regardless of that I do agree with him that I‚Äôm scared for the kids and for my sister. My sister thinks her ex just wants to make her life worse but I honestly don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs his intention. He and the rest of the family are just seriously worried about her. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to at all side with my sisters horrible ex husband but I don‚Äôt want my nieces seeing this abuse and nor do I want my sister getting beat.

domesticviolence,"Here is the situation I was posed:

""I am in an abusive relationship with my child's mother. I want to leave and take my son with me to ensure his safety however currently I have no legal recourse to do so as I am not listed on the birth certificate. His mother has severe mental health problems and is currently unfit to care for him. She frequently leaves him alone in the house when I am at work to go out and get high, creating an unsafe environment for our son when they are left alone together. I am the sole provider for the household and she threatens me all day long that if I don't come home on time or early that she will leave, or hurt herself, or do something to me creating a hostile and unstable environment for our son to grow up in. She frequently attacks me when I get home, physically hitting or kicking me or throwing items at me, and being constantly verbally abusive. This is not an environment I want my son growing up in. As she sometimes snaps and becomes verbally abusive towards him as well, or will just leave for hours making threats that she is going to kill herself if she doesn't get exactly what she wants when she wants it. I know that typically in a situation like this CPS would try to place the child with a blood relative however she lives with her mother who is also not a particularly fit parent and this would not help to remedy the situation and provide a safe and healthy environment for my son.

I'm not sure if there is anything to be done, but I would appreciate any help you could possibly give.

domesticviolence,"I was lucky. I left before it could get really bad. I was in a domestically abusive relationship for over 15 years. Married with 3 children. I was devastated when the divorce process didn‚Äôt help me or my children. The biggest problem was, I never called the cops when he got violent. I kept my bruises a secret. And the one time I called the police, he charmed the female cop into believing a scratch I left on his chest was because he was the actual victim and not from me as I fought him off of me. I never called the cops again after that. I finally left when a love letter came in the mail from one of the many women he was having affairs with. See, here‚Äôs the thing, I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it had gotten. I didn‚Äôt realize how controlling he was. It wasn‚Äôt until I was free, that I realized how fucked up it had been for me. 

The thing is, I see him successfully banking on his personal protection company. The divorce process, protected his reputation. The worst thing that could happen was that people would find out that he beat his wife, all the while providing services to protect execs and celebrities. He‚Äôs making millions from this. And trust me, I cannot get this man to pay things for our children. All that money, is his, he‚Äôs never been one to share. I mean, I just bought my children freaking hand soap, despite the children and I asking him to buy them soap for months. They‚Äòre starving when I get them back, because he has no food in their fridge and often times, they are sent to bed without food for disobeying him. Every step of the way, I keep trying to fight for my children and get told, there‚Äôs nothing I can do until he really fucks up. I get that parents should have equal access to their children. I wish he was an amazing dad to them and none of this would really matter, but I cannot overstep my boundaries as the other parent and tell him how to parent. So I watch him manipulate, brainwash and systematically destroy my little children‚Äôs hearts and minds. 

I want to raise alarm to these people who they really hired, but my lawyers say he would be protected because anything I would say is slander and he could sue me for losing his business. Unfortunately for me, just before the affairs were discovered, he started deleting my photos, voice recordings, videos and any notes I had made about the abuse. Really the only proof I have of his abuse was my OBGYN saw trauma to my abdomen from when he kneed me while I was pregnant 2 weeks before my youngest was born. I also have a video of him shaking and screaming at our youngest when she was about 3 months because he was drunk/tired and she wouldn‚Äôt stop crying (I was pumping at the time). So it would really be a ‚Äôhe said, she said‚Äô situation. Granted I have eye witnesses to certain things and they were willing to testify had we had gone to trial. But again, unfortunately for me, this only really could have been brought up in my divorce. I had to end up settling, because as soon as the affairs were discovered, he drained our bank accounts and I was left with only what he was willing to give me in our temporary orders. I was a stay at home mom with no income. My lawyers advised me that the best deal was to take what money I could get, because his ultimate plan was to file for bankruptcy and never let me see a dime of our money. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äòs an alcoholic, but he‚Äôs functioning. He has 2 Teslas and honestly, he‚Äôd probably never get caught with a DUI (one way I know I could get his custody period reduced). I know he would hate Bloomberg from knowing that he is abusive, because there is one reporter there that reports for the company he provides security for that hates him. But then again, I would be in a slander situation. My attorneys tell me to keep my mouth shut and let him be successful and fight for reduction other ways. They‚Äôre more worried about the flow of money coming to me and my children. But I keep reminding them that even with all his money, he won‚Äôt help me out with our children. The only other thing I would have to wait for is if he hits one of his girlfriends and she is brave enough to stand up to him and call the police when it happens.

I think I have a way to get him criminally charged for the photoshopped documents he submitted in our divorce, but it would have to take a determined detective and DA to go after him. But even then, I don‚Äôt know if that would help me reduce his custody period. I feel like I have to wait until he endangers our children by drinking and driving or hits them so bad it can‚Äôt be explained away or he hits another woman. It‚Äôs all shitty options.

I met my ex in 2014, I was introduced to him by my second sons dad, the start was amazing and he constantly showed me love! Constantly telling me I could of picked anyone but I picked him, constantly doing things for me but then things changes. 

we had been together for about three months, when he took me to his mums wedding together, looking back it was after this night that everything changed, he would always tell me how lucky he was to have me, how he never could imagine being with a woman as beautiful as me, how lucky he was that I chose him! After this night where everyone was telling him i was way out of his league he got a bit upset and I reassured him I was the lucky one as I had done before because before this night he had done so much for me and helped around the house etc it was a true partnership, then gradually he began to stop doing things whether it be for me or round the house and he gradually started started saying how lucky I was to have him and he‚Äôd tell me how he could have his pick of any woman he wanted but he chose me and I should be greatful he did that because who else would want a single Mum, he chipped away my confidence and destroyed any self control I had, I was then his puppet to control as he wished, then one day after an argument he came back upset saying he had tried to go see his son and his ex wouldn‚Äôt let him and he stayed at his own house that night, he was acting strangely and I began to get scared we txted through out the night and we said good night love you, I called him the next day and he didn‚Äôt answer, this was strange because a pin could drop and he would wake up so I rushed round there as I feared he had committed suicide (he had attempted multiple times before) I used my key and key myself in and was scared shitless.

As I made my way upstairs to the hallway I called Out  his name nervously, until I suddenly heard him screaming aggressively for me to get out his house now, I stormed into his bedroom and it was not as I had thought he wasn‚Äôt attempting suicide he was infact in bed with another woman, she asked who I was I replied ‚Äúin his fucking girlfriend‚Äù she called him a prick and apologised to me as she left and I said sorry for the embarrassment, and in that moment as I seen the woman that was leaving I had a sudden rush of realisation.

I began shouting at him that he would never find a woman better than me and how if that the type of woman he can get then clearly he had won the lottery a million times over with me, I told him I would move on and eventually forget him whereas he‚Äôll remember me for the rest of his life, and I as I told him it was over he back handed me, I stood there holding my cheek in shock he then grabbed me and dragged me down the stairs, my bag was upstairs and no way was I leaving my phone and purse With him!

 So I shrugged his hands off me and told him straight that I was going to get my bag and rushed upstairs to get it then within a second I heard ‚ÄúIM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!!!‚Äù the way he screamed it scared the hell out of me I ran into his room and shut the door and put my back to it he began kicking and punching the door, there was literally shards of wood flying everywhere he had made a hole big enough for him to lean into the room and he grabbed me by the hair repeatedly telling me he was going to kill me, I used my foot to grab my bag as I tried desperately to keep the door shut, I dragged it over to me and tried to dial the police but he got more violent and went to hit me so I  dove onto my side, as I lay there helpless he picked up a long sharp shard of wood and lifted it in the air and screamed he was going to kill me I was in a tight spot between the bed and wall so couldn‚Äôt move so I just curled up, covered my head and raised my leg as a barrier to gain time, a few seconds pass and it falls silent I turned my head to look at  what he‚Äôs doing and as I put my leg down and move my hands from my head he immediately starts stomping on my face screaming at me, I can‚Äôt remember what he was saying because I was screaming for help, I begged him to stop, then all of a sudden all I could see was darkness I can‚Äôt even explain what it was like, I could hear and feel everything but couldn‚Äôt see, I screamed at him that I couldn‚Äôt see, he began screaming at me to get out but I couldn‚Äôt see And I kept screaming that at him and asking him to help, my vision came back a few minutes later and as I was half way from standing up with my legs like jelly he punched me to the floor again and continually punched me over and over again until he stopped to scream at me some more and tell me how this was all my fault as he stood by the bedroom door it was at that moment I got a surge of strength from god knows where and quickly jumped up and ran literally for my life, he chased me out the house screaming if I phoned the police he‚Äôd kill me and when I got into the street at the bottom of his drive I literallycollapsed  I had no energy.

whilst laying in the side of the road I got my phone from my bag and called the police he suddenly came out  got into his car and tried to run me over! Luckily I got out the way! I begged the police to hurry before he turned around and came back I told them I‚Äôd meet them at the shops round the corner, I had to hang up as I realised my kids were due to be picked up from school I called my sister and told her to call my mum and arrange someone to pick them up, I was stood there balling my eyes out and my eye had already begun to swell and nobody comforted me literally hundreds of mums and dads passed me and not one asked if I was ok and all I wanted was a cuddle. 

I had to have a head scan and As I waited for it the whole waiting room stared at me whilst I tried to hold my tears back, when my mum came in I couldn‚Äôt wait to hide my head in her shoulder and just sob my heart out and then I said ‚Äúatleast I didn‚Äôt have kids with him and never have to see him again!‚Äù Because that‚Äôs me I‚Äôll always find a positive, I then began to worry about the kids and my mum reassured me that my step dad was picking them up and they‚Äôd be fine, I told her under no circumstances can they know what happened, due to them being used to having seizures and injuring myself I told my mum we‚Äôd tell them I‚Äôd hit my head on the kitchen side as I had a fit, after having my head scanned and taking three hrs to make a police statement I was finally allowed to go home with my Mum, as me and my mum made our way into her back garden her dog seemed confused by me and started growling at me even her dog couldn‚Äôt quite tell if I was who she thought I was, as I walked into the kitchen at around 9.30pm my two babies  who were 4&amp;7at the time came running in to greet me my youngest ran into my arms whilst my eldest seemed to not want to come near me, my youngest asked ‚Äúwhat happened to your face mummy‚Äù I replied in my silly voice ‚Äúwell guess what I had a fit in the kitchen and whacked my head off the side!! So I had to go hospital!!‚Äù He then laughed and said ‚Äúohh mummy you donut‚Äù and gave me a cuddle it was the comic relief I needed after such a draining day, my eldest then said ‚Äúwhere was Brian though?‚Äù I replied ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt together no more darling I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù he replied ‚Äúbut why??‚Äù I simply said ‚ÄúI saw him kissing another girl so I ended it‚Äù he then said ‚Äúdid he do that to you mummy??‚Äù I lied and said no darling come here and he walked over and gave me a hug... I knew he didn‚Äôt believe me but I couldn‚Äôt understand how! Yes he had controlled me but the one part e had no control over was how I was with my kids, when it came to them no matter what he said or his suggestions I refused and my son had never seen violence or anger from my ex and I couldn‚Äôt understand it, he began pestering me to tell him the truth and so I took him to my mums a few days later and we told him a sugar coated version and basically said he had just slapped me, he knew already he just wanted me to be honest but it broke my heart that he knew, such an innocent child who knew nothing of abuse knew this pathetic excuse of a man had done this too me!!! I always see him and his family and they all make comments at me and it‚Äôs horrible but luckily I know how to hide my fear and anxiety, I can walk past them and want to burst into tears but my face looks composed with a slight smile as I walk past with my head held high... after the ordeal and once I was ready to date again I have vowed to never let anyone talk down to me and raised my standards by a lot, I‚Äôve been single three years now and only started dating in the last year but I am so full of confidence it‚Äôs unreal this idiot made me realise what I truly want in a life partner and it‚Äôs everything he isn‚Äôt!!

In December 2018 I met an amazing man who is now my fianc√©, he is the most supportive man I‚Äôve ever met, I don‚Äôt feel like I have to earn his affections either, if he gets pissed off he doesn‚Äôt take it out on me at all ever! First time I seen him angry was when a stranger threw a empty bottle at me in a store, he screamed at them and demanded they apologise, I was freaking out at the anger and couldn‚Äôt even look at him, when he walked away toward me he wrapped him arm around me kissed me and went back to normal. I can‚Äôt thank him enough, I never have to explain why about anything and when I begin to he tells me to calm down.  My boys absolutely love him and after all that happened with my ex my eldest son found it really hard to trust others, when my fianc√© asked their permission to marry me my son jumped into his arms.

With my ptsd I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever truly get over it but with every year I‚Äôm getting stronger, 4 years ago I‚Äôd be hyperventilating on my livingroom floor just from hearing a car door shut, now I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs getting easier to live with and I have a lot to work on but I‚Äôve worked on a lot on other stuff and it bothers me less.

domesticviolence,"Hi Everyone,

I want to share a little bit of my story in hopes that others will find comfort or a sense or relief from this.

I was always one of those people that thought ""well if your boyfriend is beating you why do you stay?"" A very ignorant thought I have since realized now that I have gone through my own domestic violence situation. In November, my ex boyfriend of 2 1/2 years broke into my house through my window at 2am, walked into my room where I was laying on my bed and went ballistic. We had broken up a week prior and were not talking much at all. He had called me that night  (very intoxicated)  and asked if I would pick him up at the bar because it was too cold for him to walk home (his license is permanently suspended due to his felony DUI) I said ""No, I am going to bed"" and hung up the phone. Did not think much of it as my ex is a drug addict/alcoholic and would do this all the time during our relationship. I was laying in my bed and heard my door open, I didn't look or think twice about it because I thought it was just my roommate coming in to grab something. I looked at the door and my ex was standing there. My ex has mentally, physically, and sexually abused me throughout our relationship but he was a typical narcissistic ""well if you hadn't done that then I wouldn't have hit you"" type of guy and deep down I knew what he was doing to me was not OK but was too ashamed to say anything to anyone. He manipulated me and got me to think that him hitting me was an accident and thought that if I was a better girlfriend he wouldn't hit me anymore. However, I am not the type of girl who would sit there and do nothing, I would try to fight back anytime I could. Anyways, he had walked into my room and started to attack me, throwing me against my bed post every time I caught my footing and was able to get up. My roommate was in her room and had not known it was my ex who came in, once he started screaming at me she realized and came out of her room to see what was going on. My ex was on a lot of drugs and was drinking on top of it, he was stumbling and pacing back and fourth from my room to the hallway. He had tried to come in my room again for ""round 3"" of kicking my ass and I was using all my strength to hold him back so that I could try to shut the door, he was pushing me and screaming at me calling me every name in the book, telling me how fucked up i am and at this point I was just exhausted and fed up, I knew that if I didn't somehow stop him soon I would get really hurt. He was grabbing me and wouldn't let go of my arms, I finally was able to release my right arm and I was so enraged that I just decked him in the face that resulted in a nice scar on my hand but boy... it was worth it. Everything that happened that night is a blur, I have trouble putting pieces of the night together and even had trouble telling the cops what had happened when they arrived. The punching and grabbing and pushing continued for what felt like hours until I had followed my ex to the hallway where he was pacing to try and push him out of the door so I could at least lock it and catch my breath, he turned around with both his hands, grabbed me by the neck and lifted me off the floor. He was smashing my head into my kitchen cabinets and I couldn't breathe. This was one of the first times that I was genuinely scared for my life because of him. I said ""please, please stop"" and he wasn't letting up. I have never to this day seen the face on my ex while he was choking me the way it was that night. I now have flashbacks everyday of this moment and constantly replay it in my head. He finally let go after 2 minutes and my roommate had come out with pepper gel and sprayed the entire canister all over his face, she didn't realize at the time that when you spray mace in an enclosed area it attacks everyone within a 50ft radius. I had pushed my ex's face to get him out of the door and touched my face not thinking and got pepper gel in my eyes, I dropped to the floor and was screaming because I couldn't see and was scared that he was going to come back in, I was rinsing my eyes with cold water in the sink as fast as I could in the case he came back into the house. My roommate had called the cops and they were there within 3 minutes. They had come in and at this point my ex has fled the scene. The cops caught him not even half a mile up the road stumbling. They arrested him, emptied his pockets and a bag of cocaine fell out. My ex has 5 charges on top of a charge for breaking probation from his felony DUI that he had just gotten out of jail for not too long before this. Here I am 4 months later making this post. I have anxiety attacks everyday, they get so bad I can't breathe and I just start shaking uncontrollably. I can't be alone in my house for long periods of time because I think my ex is going to break in again. I am embarrassed, I am upset at myself for not getting over this already. I get mad at myself for not being OK, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I go to therapy once a week, I replay that night in my head so much to the point where I just want to put a bullet in my head to stop the constant thoughts. I'm scared to go out in public in fear that I will see my ex in public as he lives in the same town as me only a mile and a half away from me. He was brought to jail that night and his mother bailed him out the next day. The court system has been useless and all they do is give him a continuance every time he has a court date, he's not on house arrest, nothing. All I got was a lousy protective order and debilitating anxiety. I repress my feelings and don't talk to anyone about anything because I don't even have to words to explain how I feel which is why I recently started seeing a therapist. All I can think is why I didn't do something to stop it earlier, why didn't I try harder to stop him from raping me, why didn't I try harder to stop him from hitting me, why didn't I try harder to get out. Is he sorry? Does he feel remorseful? Why do I care if he feels bad? Is he going to be OK in jail? Is he going to do this to another girl? Is he ever going to stop being abusive? I have gained a lot of respect for women who are involved in domestic violence cases, it is NOT as easy as just ""leaving him."" I want to apologize to any victim of crime/domestic violence for ever thinking that domestic violence cases are not as important, for being ignorant and not doing my research, for not trying to put myself into someone else's shoes. I am struggling everyday to just plain and simply live but I have also gained a lot of strength and knowledge from this as well. 

Most importantly, what I want others to gain from this is that it is OK to be sad, it is OK to be mad, to be scared. There are others, there is me who feels what you feel. I hope this brings comfort to victims of domestic violence, I want you to know you are not alone. Domestic violence is a real thing and it needs to be talked about more. It is not as easy as ""just getting out of the relationship."" I have shared my story with you all today and I know there are cases that are much more severe, cases in which people are killed but this is what I went through and how I am coping with it.

domesticviolence,"my step brother is coming home today. He was sent to live with one of his grandmas about a year ago because of an incident that involved him attacking me. He's coming back now I'm not really sure why (no one tells me anything) I think the grandma he was living with has gotten very sick or something ? I never met her but I know she's pretty old. 

Anyway I'll call my brother jay. Jay is 18 now and I'm 15 the incident happens a year and a bit ago I was 14 he was 16. He basically choked me with a belt strap and tried to strip me naked. 

This all happened not long after I'd met him. His dad married my mom nearly 2 years ago and I'd only met jay after they were married and he moved in with us. 

Jay is very intimidating to me. I don't like the idea of him being in the house again I'm really scared I don't know why everyone's so calm about him coming back. 

I feel like I'm jumping out of my skin I don't want him to live here again he truly scares me. Since I was told he was gonna come back I've been having nightmares of it. Which I haven't had since the incident happened ( I was wetting the bed and everything for days after because I was so terrified) 

Ive been practicing sliding my desk in front of my bedroom door so no one can get in my room while I'm in there. I probably sound dumb like I'm overreacting but he attacked me out of nowhere he was on something idk what but he was going to hurt me the only reason he dident was because I screamed the whole house down and his dad walked in and stopped him. 

They sent him away because they dident want him near me so I don't understand why he's coming back now 

My mom won't explain things to me I'm so confused. They say he's better now. But that dosent stop me from panicking about it. He was gonna rape me I specifically remember him saying he was going to 'shove my d*ck inside you and let yo bleed out' I was only 14 it really traumatised me being that terrified. 

I feel like everyone's just ignoring that that happened and is acting like he's this whole new amazing person üòû I don't want to be rude to him but I don't want to say hi or say anything when he gets here. My mom &amp; stepdad have told me I need to come out and say hello when he gets here but I'm not going to I'm just gonna sit in my room. 

I was told I'd never have to look at him again and now they're saying I have to speak to him ? 

I feel like no one is understanding that I'm still very scared of jay. I've been internally panicking all day. 

I'm not trying to be a brat or anything or ruin anything for anyone I'm just freaking out and no one cares.

domesticviolence,"Hi folks. Longtime listener, first time caller. I'm just looking for some words of support and encouragement.

I just received word that my ex, who was incarcerated, killed himself. We had a very complicated and emotionally abusive relationship, and just yesterday I was thinking (for the thousandth time) I wish he had killed himself instead of killing members of his family, which is unfortunately why he was in prison. In fact just a month ago I wrote him a letter asking him to stop contacting me. But now that it has happened, obviously it's different.

I'm mostly just mad. I had so much stuff to say to him, and now he forever has the last word. And fuck prisons. Fuck the criminal justice system that threw him in the ""mental health unit"" and let him get sicker and sicker as he wrote creepier and creepier letters to me the whole time.

On the bright side, this is the closest thing I have ever had to closure. This will be a relief, eventually.

domesticviolence,"On Halloween 2019 I was attacked outside my apartment and kept from getting medical attention from the man I had been seeing for the last year. This altercation was no where near the first in the relationship and definitely not the worst, but it is the one that landed me in the hospital and needing two surgeries. 

I've been in counseling and whatnot since, and am able to feel comfortable and safe in my apartment (where the altercation started and where I was kept afterwards). I've handled it decently I feel, only really getting triggered when seeing acts of violence portrayed in movies/shows but that's easy to turn off and avoid.

My biggest struggle is intimacy. I can't bring myself to be intimate with people, at any level. It's hard to talk to people on a personal level, hard to let people touch or hug me. Anything remotely intimate makes me extremely uncomfortable and slightly scares me.

His behavior has escalated over time, and now involves some of his family (his father assaulted me, and his mother and father kept me away from my daughter for an entire day)  It started with threats of violence, escalated to breaking things around our home, and now he's putting his hands on me with increasing frequency.   His assaults have ranged from holding me down, to choking me until I urinate on myself.  Yesterday was the worst one yet.  He grabbed me and started choking me, so I punched him, then he choked me tighter, almost making me pass out.  I've called the police before, but I was told that if I pressed charges, they would have to arrest both of us.  What the fuck am I supposed to do, let him kill me?

-No history of violence in our relationship until...
I was 6 months pregnant (with our now 13 month old), we had an argument (I can't even remember what about) and he pushed me to the ground.
Then today happened. After therapy we were fine and decided to have a beer. Ran into a POS who sexually harassed me at my job until I quit. To my husband I said ""I'm surprised he isn't a registered sex offender"" to which my husband said ""That's mean don't say that, he isn't that bad."" The person is physically ""handicapped"" more like disfigured. I looked at my husband and said ""He told me he was going to bend me over in the bathroom. He said he was practicing yoga so he could fuck me. My coworker who doesn't even like me was so disgusted with the things he was hearing he yelled at the guy and tried to kick him out. Then our boss, YOUR boss, looked at the manager standing next to me and said 'She's a female bartender, that's part of her job. He isn't kicked out.' YOUR boss didn't even look at me while he dismissed me. Do you still think I'm mean?"" Husband stayed silent while said POS came over and tried to have a conversation. We get home, puppy had an accident, I don't clean it up because I just need some fucking help. Husband sees it and gets mad that he's cleaning it. Really, no words were exchanged. I walk downstairs to run on the treadmill and I hear crashing upstairs. I run up to grab the baby, he doesn't want to give her to me, I say I don't want her to see you throw things and go back to our bedroom with her. He follows me down yelling ""you can't take my daughter away from me"". I don't notice he grabs my gun...he fires it. Not at me, not in the same room as me. He fires it at the laundry room ( I find out after the police arrived). I'm locked in the bedroom with the baby. I thought he was dead, but I wasn't sure. He had a suicidal episode years ago when he couldn't get help and he tried everything in his power to get help. Then he tried to come in the bedroom, gave up, I heard him walking around upstairs. I immediately called his therapist. I told the therapist there was no way I was getting the cops involved if it meant he would get arrested. It would ruin our lives. We sacrificed too much to get where we are. Therapist said he wouldn't go to jail and calls 911, dispatcher asks for my husbands info and I tell her ""No. I won't give it to you if you're going to arrest him. He didn't threaten me."" I'm assured he wont be arrested and they just want to make sure he is safe and gets help. He's arrested. He was point blank honest with the officers. Officer said even though I am not pressing charges the prosecuting attorney might. I feel like the system failed us. He buckled under stress he wont talk about to me or his therapist and jail is only going to add to it. More bills, less job opportunities, family is affected, etc. I understand they need to make sure I'm safe and so is the baby. I deeply feel like a place to address his mental health would have been proper. What the fuck is jail going to do for him/us other than pile on more shit?
We are generally supportive of each other. 99% of our fights are ""I'm so angry you wont just take a day to yourself to relax"". The other 1% is ""you literally took the garbage to the can and left it on top instead of opening the can and putting the trash inside..""
 His coping mechanism is stonewalling or ""I'm just a fuck up who can't do anything right"". Mine are pretty terrible too, but we don't do name calling (once ever) and physical abuse isn't in our routine. He gets mean when his ex girlfriend gets nasty about their kid. Hence he automatically escalated to ""you can't take my daughter from me"". In the past he has said he would take our daughter from me and make sure I didn't get custody with the dirt he has on me. We weren't even arguing. It came up after he got off the phone with his ex. I would generally say he is a great dad. He is supportive, loving, affectionate, and patient. I say generally, because sometimes I have to stop him and say ""Would you be okay with our daughter being treated this way by her SO"".

I honestly don't know if I'm delusional and not realizing I'm in an abusive relationship. What the fuck is happening?

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone, this is my first post from here so I am not quite sure how to introduce myself. I have been married to my husband for almost 3 years, and we have had problems with him having toxic behavior for the past 2 of those 3 years. Over time, it has just gotten worse. Today I had just gotten out of the shower, and he was in the shower and we were talking. He was saying something about someone his brother had met, and as he kept saying it I said ""I don't know who that is"" or something along the lines. I did kind of yell it but not necessarily scream, but that set him off. He started throwing things at me that were in the shower and even broke the top of one of the bottles. He told me himself that he'll never directly hit me because I'll call the cops, because I apparently want to call the cops and am using him for money. He's not rich, but makes about $7/hr more than I do. He likes to use this against me. He also went on telling me how my whole family, grandparents, sister, mom, no one gives a shit about me. Later while he's at work, he has the nerve to text and ask when I'm going to apologize. I texted him saying I shouldn't have yelled, but he had no right to throw things. He still thinks it's somehow my fault and I am to blame for everything. He may not directly punch me in the face, but there are times he grabs me hard and I have to tell him to stop. He is from the middle east, and personally from what I have seen in his culture for the past 3 years I find it to be a very sexist culture. He likes to tell me how I would basically be a piece of shit without him and that before him I couldn't cook or clean right. He doesn't help out around the house, because even though I cook,clean, study, and work he apparently can't help with any of it and believes he's a saint if he does. As I'm sure many previous abused women feel, I'm scared to leave because we have so many things jointly made together, bank accounts, car, lease, etc. Luckily, no kids. 3 years ago I moved from the midwest to a southern state, and I honestly don't have many friends here. My friends know everything he has done, and they know I plan on leaving him eventually. I just don't even know the first steps to go about it. He is so fucking toxic and just an awful person all around. I hate being stuck with a man child who can't even pay his own bills without my help, who I make breakfast and dinner for and constantly feel unappreciated and emotionally abused. I don't know what to do at this point and I know it's damaging my mental health as I do feel hopeless at times. Please, any and all advice is appreciated. Also, I do have many recordings of the things he has said to me and proof/evidence. I know this may be useful in the future. Please, help in any way you can with words of wisdom or advice.

domesticviolence,"I'm beginning to feel very trapped and it's making me panic everyday because I don't know what to do. 

I've been in a relationship for a few months now (I am 18 and he is 22) I moved in with him about 2 weeks ago. I don't have a great relationship with my mum and she always hated my boyfriend since she met him. ( I admit that part of the reason I moved  in with him was to spite my mum) she specifically told me she'd disown me if I moved in with him and continued to date him. This has been true so far. 

When I first moved into his apartment everything was really nice but he soon changed his mood I guess. He's always so super angry all the time. He's always screaming at me which is something that he never did before I moved in with him. He really frightens me sometimes. I find myself freaking out when he pulls up in the drive way if an afternoon because I know he's gonna be mad at me for something. I once left my drink sitting on the table and he flipped his shit at me because I didn't use a coaster. So I apologised and started using a coaster but then another time apparently I used the wrong coaster and he screamed at me for it. He is very confusing he refuses to explain things to me. I'm so nervous around him. His yelling is so intimidating because he gets right in my face and it makes me panic 

Last night I accidentally dropped a glass in his kitchen and I thought he was going to kill me or something. He was yelling at me while I was cleaning it up telling me I did it on purpose but it was an accident I dident mean it. I cleaned it up and I gave him money for breaking it and he just snatched it out of my hand and told me 'not to fucking do it again'. 

Then a few hours after that happened he came up to me and asked for me to hug him and I did and he squeezed my ribs so hard I couldn't breathe properly he said something about me always making a mess. Anyway he dident stop squeezing me until I began crying for breath. 

So now I've no idea what I'm meant to do. I've called my mum and I told her about him squeezing me and she just basically said I told you you should have listened to me now what have you got yourself into. And she said no I can't move back in with her. And she's blocked my phone number and is currently ignoring me idk what to do I'm so stupid 

I've been googling domestic violence stuff and it's telling me to call police and they'll put me in a women's shelter and stuff but what is that ? Idk what that is I don't want to live in a shelter. This is too much for me I'm panicking so much. I've always been pacing back and forth waiting for him to yell at me when he gets home but now I've gotta worry about him squeezing me again. I want to just hide in the room but I'm worried that might anger him. 

Idk how to get out of this please give me some advice I'm honestly really scared because I don't know what I should do üòû I want to move back in with mum so bad but she won't even answer the phone. 

I realise moving in with my bf was a mistake. I barely knew him. I don't want to be with him anymore but I don't want to be homeless! I feel like I've ruined my life and I've only just turned 18.

domesticviolence,"TW: abuse, violence, sexual violence

&amp;#x200B;

Almost straight after breaking up with my first love 9 months ago, I became involved with my (at the time new) housemate and current boyfriend. He was the best-looking person I'd ever met, he really seemed to understand violence against women (which I've suffered from in the past) and he seemed like the perfect man. We waited for 6 months to make it official.

Before we were together there were occasions that he acted abusively. I stood up for myself every time, stopped sleeping with him several times, and he showed signs of improvement. This made me think he'd changed and I felt like I had equal power even though he messed up sometimes. After making it official things were really nice for a few weeks, but since they have been really bad. He's acted verbally abusively towards me on numerous occasions, gaslights me constantly (even during the 'good' periods), and emotionally abuses me quite regularly. I am unable to stand up for myself now because it often leads to more or worse abuse and he is completely uninterested in changing. A few days ago he aggressively slammed a door I was stood right in front of twice in a row and it was so hard that it caused our housemates' entire room to vibrate.

I want to leave him but it's difficult because I live with him. The tenancy agreement doesn't end until September and he has exams for his university course for the next few weeks then we have a break then I have my exams. I'm also worried about the risk of violence and more abuse. I've read 'Why Does He Do That' by Lundy Bancroft and it's amazing and has helped me recognize the situation I'm in. In his chapter about leaving abusers, he explains that even men who have never been physically abusive can become violent after breakups. He said that studies have shown that by far the most accurate predictor for future violence is the woman's gut instinct.

In my gut, I think it's possible he could be physically abusive towards me. I can't see severe violence occurring but I think he will definitely block me from leaving the room during discussions and spread rumours about me to friends. I can see him shoving/slapping/potentially even punching me and I'm worried about the impact that would have on my mental health and my exams. I can also see him being sexually violent. This is based on my gut feelings as well as his tendencies to go back on his word. So far every 'principle' he preaches he has betrayed. He preaches a lot about being anti-cheating, anti-using women for sex, anti-manipulation, anti-rape, and anti-physical domestic violence. I know for a fact he's done the first three to either me or previous partners, yet he'll still preach tirelessly against them and make special exceptions for himself. I'm also scared because, at the time, the door-slamming felt physically threatening and intimidating. That said I can only see most of this happening if we're in the house alone together.

I wanted the thoughts of others, please? I'm concerned and would like to hear from others who have been in similar situations.",I live with my abuser and two friends. I need to leave him.

domesticviolence,"My husband has always controlled the finances. He kept his money separate from mine, which wasn't much as I am unemployed (stay at home parent/student). We have a 10 month old son. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression shortly after he was born, and spiraled bad for a while. He seemed nothing but loving and supporting during this time, wouldn't leave me alone with my thoughts.

Well, one of my concerns as time went on was that my entire family moved 1200 miles away, and every time I suggested saving for a flight to take our son and visit my family he would shoot the idea down. We can't afford that, some of your family smokes cigarettes, it's better if he's stays up here where he knows people, etc. But a couple of weeks ago, he offered me something I've been longing for: I couldn't take our child with me, but he would book me a flight to visit family. I was hesitant, but after discussion and constant assurance that he wasn't sending me away I accepted the offer and we booked the flight to Kansas City. He told me to take my time, and let him know when I was ready to come home, and we would get a return flight situated. 

I landed the afternoon of the 19th. Began to feel better mentally. I was able to visit friends, be there for my grandmother's services as she passed away just hours after the flight was booked. I sent a message on the 23rd letting him know I was ready to come home.

He ignored the topic for three days. It started to feel like he really didn't want me to come back, and I voiced this concern. Then Tuesday night (Feb 25) he told me I needed mental help, it's beyond him helping, he's sorry but he isn't sorry for the time spent together, this was out of his control and he still loved me. He spent that entire night convincing me that this wasn't his choice, we were staying with his parents and I wasn't allowed to return to my husband and son for reasons beyond his control, that he wasn't allowed to share.

I used a throwaway account to post on r/legaladvice. I had a free lawyer consultation. I wanted as much information regarding my rights as a parent and as a tenant at will in the situation. My SNAP benefits were frozen when I called and explained the situation because I was sent out of state without my card and didn't want to get in trouble for fraud.

We speak the following night. I offer to borrow money for a flight and for us and our child to stay at a motel for a few days while we sort things out with his parents. His story changes. He says it's my mental health, which had been on the decline and made worse by the medication I was prescribed. I said I knew I needed help, had been actively searching for a provider before I left. But he needed to provide sufficient proof of income and until he did I wouldn't be able to get Medicaid reinstated. I gave him a plan to seek immediate emergency care upon returning home while we get the insurance situation sorted.

The story changed again. I'm unemployed, he only makes 360 a month, he can't afford to take care of me anymore. I point out I had been taking steps to be self sufficient. That I had been paying for my own things, paying him back when he told me to. He didn't care how much I paid back, he was just looking at how much he had spent on me (but wouldn't tell me exactly how much). Started yelling at me, because he found my post on r/legaladvice and said he couldn't work through the ""threats of legal action"". It became a 90 minute shouting match before I hung up and, for the fourth time since this started, contacted the suicide hotline. Not because I was suicidal, but because I needed someone to talk to.

After I finished explaining the situation and started thinking about things I had let slide in the past, she suggested getting an advocate for financial and emotional abuse. He's done a lot of things that have bothered me greatly that I tried to set aside for the sake of our marriage and the sake of our son,  and at this point I have began to wonder if my depression was really postpartum. I did have a complicated pregnancy, but he made that situation worse mentally with words and actions. He moved me away from my family when I was six months pregnant. Started using my mental health against me.

Somedays, when I was taking the meds, it was so bad. Getting out of bed was a struggle. He would have to remind me to eat or take a shower. My mind was in a fog that a psychiatrist felt would be lifted if she increased the dose. He forced me to continue the medication while I found someone else for management.

And last night, he tells me I did this all to myself. That I shouldn't have let my mental illness get so bad. That I should have sought help sooner. That I should have found a job right now. That I rarely spend time with our son or take care of him, and ""don't give me the mental health BS"". That I claim I was taking steps for improvement, but that there was no change. That he was the victim and he couldn't - wouldn't - take care of me anymore. And has now left me homeless without our son as a result.

I'm... at a loss. The only benefit from this situation is in regards to realizing this has been years of emotional and financial abuse, that he's shut me out so I have had time to think of everything he did wrong. He hoped I had a miscarriage. He was barely there for me emotionally when I was diagnosed with preeclampsia and hospitalized at 35 weeks. He would offer to buy me games or whatever but would call it ""payment for goods and services"" - even if I wasn't in the mood. And those are just the tip of the iceberg.

I am not a resident where I had been staying, and the arrangements were only temporary, so I have no choice but to go back. I return tomorrow afternoon. And I'm afraid he's going to keep manipulating people and that he won't let me see our child. He's not willing to give me so much as transportation to a motel or shelter. He's refused to provide me with the paperwork to verify my financial aid and continue my education. He's refused to provide me with a signature to start an income driven repayment plan ($0/mo for a year) with my student loan servicer. And while he maintained for a while that he wouldn't keep me from our son, I'm terrified that he will and use my mental health against me.

Today my father assaulted me because I had his car keys. He lunged at me trying to grab it out of my hands, and I did not let go. He then proceeded to punch me three times in the face, and I still did not let go. I wasnt fighting back in any way, just holding onto the keys. I weigh 120lbs and Im 5' tall while he is a 6' tall man that weighs over 250 lbs. He sat on my face and suffocated me with his thigh until I finally let go of the keys. When I got free, I tried to run to another room and he grabbed me by the shirt, opened the basement doors, and threw me down a flight of stairs. I tumbled down face first and hit my head on the wall. I got up immediately and called my boyfriend and then the police. By this time he fled the scene with his car and I still do not know where he is. The ambulance carried me away to the hospital while I reported the crime to the police and they said that hes going to be arrested and theyre looking for him.

domesticviolence,"Realized That I am a victim of domestic abuse (Florida)

Just Realized I am a victim of domestic abuse [FL]

I am currently seeking to gain joint custody of my child. I basically always knew the mother to be caddy, jealous, rude, selfish and generally narcissistic, it is why I tried to leave her several times before she told me she was pregnant. So, earlier this morning I started looking up definitions of domestic abuse and it‚Äôs checking one too many boxes and now I am having a full blown anxiety attack realizing, what I have been experiencing isn‚Äôt as crazy as I feel it sounds when I try to describe it to others. She has been gaslighting me since the beginning of the relationship, making me question my memory, my sanity and my self worth. She sexually abused me, made threats to keep my child from me, threats to ruin my life, reputation and also that of people close to me, stole money from my bank account and the list goes on. Before I was only trying to seek joint custody, but this process that I wanted to take a few weeks to hammer out has turned into a several month long slog where I am forced to go to her house and subject myself to further abuse in order to have time with my child. She continues to try and exert her control over me and I am at my wits end as no one seems to know what to do other than tell me to tough it out. She would also regularly denigrate me and made me feel, helpless, hopeless, depressed, and afraid.

I honestly could keep going, but now that I am empowered with this new knowledge I am wondering where to go from here. I already have a lawyer handling my custody battle and as it is too early to talk with them about this subject I am looking for starter guidance. Should I ask my current lawyer to help with this new ‚Äútopic?‚Äù Or should I look for another lawyer to seek criminal charges if I am even able to find some kind of compensation for the past few years of hell that I have lived through? In the end all I really want is custody of my child. I was fine with sharing custody before when I convinced myself that she was capable of being reasonable, now I am fearful that as my child ages that her target might change to my child and I will do anything I can to prevent that.

I plan to find a therapist that specializes in this type of situation, but aside from that I am not sure what steps to take and in what order. Should I call the police? Get another lawyer for new litigation, or bring this to my current lawyer and expand the scope of work?

domesticviolence,"I have never dealt with something like this. I've been talking this this friend since around early December, I picked him up and started being his friend and support because he had none, and I had a basic understanding of the amount of shit he's been through, but I had absolutely no idea. His biological father was in his life from birth to around 6 years old. He has constant ptsd that he comes to me about. He tells me about his bio father showing him how to cut himself, burned him, beat him, cut him with a hot knife, kept him back from school so no one would know, and constantly told him to kill himself all before reaching the age of 6. His mother was a constant observer and slight preparator as well, compared to all this. His dad is no longer in his life, he never told me how that happened, I'm sure he went to jail or something, but now he continues to try to contact my friend, and continue his ptsd and abuse.
 
I thought this is where it ended. What made everything so hard for him now. He's in constant pain.

We hung out two nights ago. Before this he told my about his current stepdad. General fights, he would take his things, his family asks how much money he has constantly, and take everything he has, (also his things)and don't allow him to have a bank account, so they can do so. Pretty fucked up in its own regard, but I didn't think it was much on him compared to what he's been through. Until that night me and my other friend picked him up to give him a good time, some time away, and he had blood all over. Face and hands. He told me he got into a fight with his stepdad before he left. At that point I talk and help him through it, and show him a good night. He texts me the next day about how happy he was to hangout with people, and few hours later I'm told he's beaten again, busted lip, blood all over, swollen jaw, loose teeth, and that he was blacking out. I was asleep at this point, and a few hours later he tells me that he had been beaten again. I woke up a few minutes later, and I instantly told him to call the police, which he had already done, and he was being held. We worked through the moment, and around thirty minutes later his dad was released. He came home, and beat him for the third time, that he said he didn't consider so bad considering how much physical abuse and damage he had just taken. 
I really don't know what I should do or suggest to him at this point. He has no where to go even if he does just run away, and I already offered him to stay here most nights when me and my girlfriend get our car fixed. 

Any help or advice on this situation would be so much appreciated. I feel like there really is something I should do or suggest him but I really am at a loss.

(ex. grandmother, brother, mother, sister, etc.) I'd also like to say my grammar might be a bit off, since I want to get this out of me as fast as possible and don't want to spell check everything.  


For my whole life my mother has verbally abused myself and my brother which (I believe) has lead to me and my brother (16) becoming antisocial and untrustworthy of people. I'm currently 18 years old and I've always believed one day, surely, I will be able to move out with my brother and cut off complete connection with my mother. That was until recently. Before stating what happened I want to set the stage if you will. I live with my brother (16), sister (9), grandma (in her 60s) and my mother (in her late 30s). For around 80% of my life I lived with just my mom, brother and father but my dad was kicked out by my mom when I was very young. I only recently around 2 and half years ago moved into a larger apartment with my mom, grandma, brother and sister. Every month or so my Mother will blow up and yell at everyone and sometimes she takes me and my brothers stuff or breaks our stuff. She has hit me once or twice in my life but usually she doesn't get into anything physical other than breaking our stuff. Since I'm 18 now she's not allowed to touch me whatsoever or break my stuff so that makes me feel a bit more safe but I'm scared for my brother, sister and grandmother since they're all more vulnerable to my mother. I'd also like to note I've called the cops 3 times now on her for getting really angry at my grandmother for no reason and breaking a lot of stuff.   


Roughly 2 days ago she went overboard. CPS has been showing up to my house once a month for previous issues and the CPS lady who shows up made a report (because my mom wasn't letting them see my sister) and they had someone corporate visit. This is when she flipped out. She assaulted my grandmother and tried breaking into my room to presumably hurt me. I locked my door, barricaded it and called the police. She threw several things at my door and even tried to pick the lock to get in but I told her if she continued I was going to call the police, which is what I did right after saying that. The police showed up and talked to me, took my grandma outside and got her statement and then they arrested my mother and she resisted which resulted in her being pushed onto our living room floor and almost tazed (I was in my room). The police then took my statement and left. My grandma cried a lot and I told her it would be alright. My sister was crying too and I comforted her. I then had my friend pick me up and take me to his house (where my brother already was, he visits on the weekends). I was told my mother was allowed to come home yesterday and take her stuff (purse, clothes, etc.) but I wasn't here. I was also told her Dad doesn't want her staying with him so I'm assuming she's at a Hotel but the idea that she's committed suicide crosses my mind a lot. She's supposed to appear in court Monday (tomorrow) and go in front of a judge and I'm really scared of what's going to happen. I'm afraid she's going to be let off with a stern warning but no real punishment and she might come back to our house and harm or even murder me and the rest of my family. My grandmas dad just got put into the hospital too last night so I was forced to come home so I can watch my sister.

It's been 2 months since I have broken up with my ex, who I was in a relationship with for almost 3 years. It was ugly and I did things I don't want to think about. What I noticed however was the behavior he presented which was just straight up ugly the moment we broke up. He immediately went on facebook to scrutanize my name and harassed me when he believed I blocked him. I called his friend the day after saying that I hoped that my ex would be ok, and just checking in to see how he was doing, but since then, I left him and his friends alone. I told one of his closest friends that I was moving on and that I wished him the best and hoped that he learned from the mistakes he made, as I would as well, in which she gaslighted me. We lived in a dorm together and so I asked the head of residence life to contact him on my behalf to see if he wanted me to move out (or vice versa), however, given that he had to move into his frat house, I felt it was going to happen.

At the same time, my ex was starting to harass me out of nowhere, texting me where I was and if I was off to see my mistress. A week later, I issued a no-contact order on him after that slew of messages. He texted other people how I was batshit crazy, that real people know I am a lying, cheating scum and that nobody would believe me. He claimed that I begged for 3 days to be with him when he said he was over and that he tried to ruin his life. He said that I had lied about the claims I made when I explained that often I my ex changed my perception of what was true and false and it made me confused about what I saw was real and what was not. An example of this was when he forced me to go to a party and when I said I wanted to leave, he told me he never forced me to come and that I could have just left.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months in and he still talks about me angrily as if I tried to destroy his life because I put the no-contact order and because people in the university knew about our history, especially given that our suitemates heard us fighting in the past. My friends were disgusted at how he often put me down.

I have trouble just getting over the relationship because of this. It angers me that this individual has the willingness to call me a scumbag but has done so many fucked up things to me and fails to even mention all the wrong he did.

After all the incident that happen when we were at cam lejuene I have called the military police twice in just one month. The first called was when they have to take away his gun in the house because he's so drunk verbally and physically abusing me. The problem is that when I decided to leave him and I started filling a divorce, custody and visitation since we have 1 kid together.

My atty was asking for the police reports for I asked that in order for him to do some visitation he needs to be sober and and I want someone with him because he used to drink hard while watching the kids while im at work and that's what i am scared of.

When i tried asking camp lejuene about the reports they only provided 1 which is not even accurate. I asked for the first incident report but they said it doesn't exist.
I was very shocked and did not understand how could that happen? There are MP came, his command came, the report was taken, even our family advocate and counselor was telling me that they read the report and how he's a jerk to MP's.

domesticviolence,"TL;DR at the bottom.

My mother is a gentle soul, very kind and loving for the most part but unfortunately she became a victim of opiate addiction. Mainly medicinal drugs containing opium derivatives.

Both my parents are doctors and after some serious efforts from my parents, me and my siblings and the rest of our family she is finally on the road to recovery.

She's recently been suffering from severe periods of pain in her right upper body, father prescribed some medicines which she started taking.

Once the medicine ran out and she needed more, she decided to ask one of the male staff in our hospital to get some, as per norm.

But my father is a very suspicious person, he figured mother must've bought some more *Tramadol* containing medicines so last night, when he found out, he started shouting at her. Then proceeded to choke her for a few seconds before slapping her 2 or 3 times.

I learned about the whole incident today when I inquired my mother about the marks on her neck after father had gone to work. During the time they were getting ready neither of them said much if anything at all.

Now the issue is I can't call the police or any other such authorities, my country has no domestic abuse helpline. If I do call the police that will only exacerbate the issue because divorce is pretty much suicide for women in our fucked up society. So my mother can't get away, neither can she ask for help.

What should, as her 17 yo son do in this case? My father has never displayed this sort of behavior before. Although mother was an addict for a long time and she regularly snuck in drugs, we eventually were able to control the issue, so why the sudden outburst?

TL;DR: Father chocked and slapped mother last night because she bought some medicines he himself had prescribed to her, all because she asked a member of the male staff and not him to get them for her. What should I do?

domesticviolence,"I posted this somewhere else, but maybe it still takes subject matter experts to really understand and be able to comment knowledgeably?

Looking back (over more than a decade) there were signs that I would never have picked up on if I hadn't started learning while the last couple of years have been bad. My wife is older than me. I don't know if she's lashing out because she's insecure or if she has just realized that I'm no longer needed.

I'll try to keep it short, but here are some examples that gave me cause to learn about emotional abuse and narcissism:

Starting to make big decisions without me

Not telling me about day to day stuff, like leaving the house and not saying anything.

Zero empathy displayed

Ignoring/silence

Criticizing me for my harmless hobbies, getting into shape

I'm ""too negative/sensitive""

Trying to embarrass/humiliate me in public

I got into a serious accident that was due to her negligence (I could have died). She told the trauma nurses that I just ""liked the attention"" when they remarked that I was in relatively good spirits (it doesn't help to be a jerk to your nurses). Never apologized for the accident, never showed much concern, mocked me when I told her my doc said I was doing really well with healing.

Threatened divorce because she said I ""dont like to do things for her"". I had just driven 100miles in a blizzard to take her to a hospital appointment.

Plays the opposite game. I'm automatically wrong when I say something.

So there's more, but I think that paints a picture. I almost left her. We talked a lot and kinda came to an agreement to start over, but she didn't really apologize for most of it. She thought it was okay to spy on my email, for example.

That was a few months ago, but I'm starting to see things again:

Trying to compete with me for the dog's attention. I refuse to mess him up like that, but she will interrupt when I play with him, or tell me he's too tired to go running with me - and then take him out instead.

The ignoring, lack of interest/empathy, not telling me where she's going - are all coming back.

Seemingly trying to push me out of a group activity we both do, bringing in a replacement, saying I can ""leave if I want to"".

Being mean about a performing art thing, saying I ""drove people away"", but then telling a friend the truth - that some of the audience had already said they had to leave early.

This last week or two she seemed irrationally angry, as if I had done something wrong but she wasn't going to tell me.

I don't want to believe it, but part of me isn't surprised. If it is narcissism, then I've read the stories of how this is supposed to go, and it only gets worse. I will have a hard time getting my life back together if I have to go, but I guess nothing is worth staying with a narcissist - right?

domesticviolence,"Hi there. My first post on here (F31). My ex (M34) was emotionally and sexually abusive, and would have violent outbursts at times. He never physically injured me, so it took me many years to see that it's still abuse even without the violence. I stayed with him for 9 years.  


TL;DR How do I stop apologising when there is no need for an apology?  


I got used to apologising a huge amount, for everything I may think I do or say wrong, for things I do wrong, and well... I apologise for simply being to be honest. I'm in a different relationship now, for the last 1,5 years. The man I'm with now is amazing, and he does not have a nasty bone in his body. He's being incredibly supportive of me going through all the stuff I am - I've recently started counselling for sexual trauma (from both ex and other men), and he's there for me as much as he can. We're long distance though, so rely mostly on webcams/chat.  


Anyway, he pointed out to me that I've been apologising a lot again recently. Just a little nudge that I don't need to apologise to him for random little things. I appreciate his nudge, as it's something I do want to stop doing - it's not a healthy habit for me nor is it good for our relationship.  


But how? I don't really notice it. I feel so bad for \_being\_. I feel bad for voicing any opinions or emotions. I feel bad for needing attention and talking ""too much"". I feel bad for feeling bad... My boyfriend is really understanding and caring, but I know he finds it difficult that I sometimes behave as if he's a danger. I know rationally he is not, but as my psychologist say, my anxiety levels are incredibly high 24/7. I have C-PTSD and other MH problems too.","How to stop apologising, after many years in an abusive relationship?",LittlePurrx,2020-02-27 21:35:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fajecj/how_to_stop_apologising_after_many_years_in_an/,1,1.0,2,11,322
domesticviolence,"Three years to the day, I left a 6 year relationship full of abuse. At every level. I had to plan out and find an escape when pregnant but was held captive since we had one vehicle and he worked all day. I felt so discouraged in ever getting free. He forbidden me to even drive to see my family for 10+ months. But let me back up. 

So first act of abuse was about one year together where he fractured my nose which I had to have surgery for.  It was his only time where he ever apologized for his abuse. I forgave him. Made up a story to protect him. 

For several years, abuse was more on than off. He'd change then he'd snap. He would say he loves me, then mention my 125lb body was fat. He'd say I'm smart then call idiot. He swore to propose only after I let him have a three way. 

Before I knew it, love turned into being groomed and brainwashed. I was told he'd hurt my family and then come for me if I ever let police know what he did. He said it would be my fault if he got arrested for making him that mad. Then tell me I'd ruin his potential career and it'd be my ass. 

Once he was losing his mind like never before. Before work, he snapped over discussing bills. He jerked me around our apartment and slammed me into a door frame. Then he picked me up by my throat and body slammed me, tightening his hands around my throat saying it was ""time for me to die"". Right as things we black he let go. I remember trying to breath and pull air in as if I was dying of thirst and got water. He kicked me in the side. Then as I try to get to bathroom, he shoved me into the tub and spat on me. 
But then finally knock at the door. It was the police thank god. The neighbor called them bc they heard the fight and me crying pit. But before he opened the door he said if ""I get charged w domestic abuse, he wouldn't be in jail forever.  So I had to lie to the cops. They didn't buy it but I begged so hard for them not to take him they finally agreed as long as we separated for my sake. So I left to my family's home. It was traumatic. I was in so much pain... but knew the signs of abuse were all there and they could report him. So I didn't go to the er. 
After that happened ...couple months later, I had been fine. Moving forward. I didn't ever go back for my stuff.   He left three page letter begging to just come talk. I resisted but finally gave in. We had a long talk. He pulled the stops to win me back and my dumbass believed him ....

Self help books helped me feel less depressed, stressed, and anxious. I'm more level headed now, which only seems to make his treatment towards me and general attitude worse. I'm still in this situation. Selling my house (where he stays with me) and getting away. He has threatened to burn it down if I left him.

This is going to be long and I already know the answer but I need to hear it from someone else.¬† 

I met my fianc√© when I was 16. I‚Äôm 43 now. He became extremely abusive about 6 months after we met and maybe 3 months after we became exclusive. I stayed with him because I was young and na√Øve and I honestly had no idea how to escape. He went to prison when I was 17 and pregnant with our first child. I stayed with him for that time and left when he got out and exhibited the same behavior. I had moved out of state while he was incarcerated so it was easy to just sneak out and head back to my momma‚Äôs house to get away. I moved back a year or so after he was released and allowed him to come see our son. During one of these visits, he raped me and I became pregnant with our second son. He‚Äôs been in and out of prison since then and our second son really has no memory of ever being around him because I kept him away. Our oldest doesn‚Äôt really care if he‚Äôs around or not, he never has. But, the youngest has always wanted him to be around and wondered about him. So, when he was released after a 7 year bid in 2018, he reached out to him. He came to our house to see him and he was so different. He was so kind and caring. It was like all the bad parts of him had been removed and all that remained was the good. He was perfect. We rekindled our relationship and were completely inseparable. What I didn‚Äôt know at that time was that he had a raging drug addiction before he went to prison and had started occasionally using again. He violated his probation and was sent back to prison for 9 months. I waited for him because I‚Äôm a recovering addict so I get that part. Relapses happen, it‚Äôs part of recovery for most. When he was released, he was the same person I fell in love with. Still kind and caring. He still acted like I hung the moon. But, exactly one week after he was released, he violated probation again and went back for 3 months. Again, I stayed with him. Then, he was released and had served his full sentence so there was no probation. He was ok for the first few weeks but then he changed. He was obviously using again. I tried to help him get clean and hoped for the best. It got progressively worse. He became a fucking demon. In one month, I had 2 black eyes, a busted lip, too many bruises to count, and damage to my knee and thumb that haven‚Äôt healed after about 6 weeks. I think I may also have some kind of damage to my scalp from having my hair pulled so much because I can‚Äôt really feel it when I scratch my head. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a thing so if anyone has any input on that I‚Äôd really appreciate it. The worst part of the abuse is the things he would make me do, though. When he would get high, he would make me go with him to the drug infested areas and the people he was hanging out with and make me perform sexual acts on them. This happened twice. Keep in mind, these people are basically homeless due to their crack addiction so they smelled terrible and I actually threw up. It was horrible but I was terrified so I did as I was told. I want to clarify something here. I wasn‚Äôt afraid of getting beat. I could take that. I was afraid our youngest son would see that he‚Äôd beat me and kill him. Our youngest exhibits the same violent behavior as him and he completely adores me.¬† And, I couldn‚Äôt bear that. I'll do whatever I can or take whatever I need to in order to save my sons. Three weeks ago, he came home high as balls and made me go with him. As soon as I saw him I burst into tears because I didn‚Äôt want to have to do anything with anyone just so he could continue to get high. He didn‚Äôt make me do anything with anyone else but I was forced to perform oral sex on him for HOURS.¬† When he finally felt like I‚Äôd had enough (only because I faked an injury), he found a prostitute and had her continue. I was there and had to watch this. This added a whole new level to the abuse because I've been a victim of sexual assault before him so I wanted to help her but I also wanted to escape and was torn between helping her and getting the fuck away. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit I chose to escape. I‚Äôll probably always feel guilty about that. When I got home, I realized he had my keys and while I was trying to figure out who to call, he showed up. He gave me the keys to get in and I locked the doors behind me so he couldn‚Äôt get in. Eventually, he agreed that if I‚Äôd let him in to shower and get his stuff he would leave. I had been up for over 24 hours at this point and knew he‚Äôd done all of the drugs a few hours earlier so I believed him. I made him come in through the front door while I left out the back door so he couldn‚Äôt get to me. He didn‚Äôt leave, though. He just stayed until he wore me down and I needed to go to sleep. I did sleep in my car for a few hours but by this point I‚Äôd been awake for over 36 hours. So, I parked outside our house and asked him to let my dog out because she hadn‚Äôt been out for about 15 hours (this is a guess) and she hadn‚Äôt been fed. He came out with the dog, crying and apologizing for everything. I was so exhausted I accepted this and went in the house to sleep. I‚Äôve been clean from heroin for about 7 years but as soon as I woke up I started reaching out to people I used to use with. Within an hour, I had someone who could get me dope and I left while he was asleep. Heroin was my very best friend for so many years so of course I ran back to it. I came back to the house to do it because I knew the risks of using after being clean for so long. I knew I did too much but didn‚Äôt care because who in the fuck would want to live like this???? I made it to the bed and once I sat down, I just fell over on him. I had seizures strong enough that I ended up chipping my tooth and pissing myself for hours. According to him, this went on for 4 hours while he was trying to wake me up. Obviously, I could‚Äôve died. But, I literally gave no fucks at that point. When I woke up, he was holding me and crying. He swore he would never use drugs again, would give me his debit card so he had no access to any money and would do whatever I needed him to do to know he was serious. He said my overdose was a wakeup call and he couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of losing me and would do anything it took to make me ok. I agreed to give him one last chance with very specific conditions. I gave him a clean slate. He was following all of my conditions and going above and beyond to make sure I knew he was serious. Then he was arrested for something that happened a month and a half ago. They‚Äôre wanting to give him life in prison based on his record. I knew the charges and pretty much knew he was guilty but tonight I received a copy of the police report and I KNOW he‚Äôs guilty. There‚Äôs no question to me. He 100% did this. He pulled up beside a prostitute, pulled out a gun, and made her get in the car. Him and the people he had with him robbed her and told her she was going with them. They stopped at a gas station and he reached back and rubbed on her and said ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs thick so she‚Äôll do‚Äù They told her where they were going and when they got there she managed to escape while he was taking a hit from a fucking crack pipe. The only thing I‚Äôm thankful for is that this woman was able to escape. Obviously, I don‚Äôt know her but I can't even imagine what she would‚Äôve been subjected to if she hadn‚Äôt gotten away. I‚Äôm disgusted as fuck. But, I now realize when he‚Äôs high women are simply a means to an end to him. He‚Äôs amazing when he‚Äôs not high, though. He's everything I ever wanted him to be and more. He's so fucking sweet and attentive. I fell in love with him when I was 16 (27 years ago), I‚Äôve been in several relationships since then, even agreed to marry a few, but I've never loved anyone even close to how much I love him. I‚Äôm heartbroken because I know he did this and I'm embarrassed as fuck because he did it. When I read the police report, the only thing I could think of was how thankful I was this woman was able to escape because I don‚Äôt want anyone to have to endure the shit I have. But, I'm also thankful that it wasn‚Äôt me. And that also makes me feel like shit.¬† 

I know he‚Äôs counting on my addiction experience to pop up and make me be ok with this because I know we do a lot of shit we wouldn‚Äôt normally do while using. I‚Äôm so fucking heartbroken right now. After 27 years and 2 kids, I'm so entangled with his family. I don‚Äôt even know how to separate myself. And, I'm fucking devasted that someone I love so much could be such an evil piece of shit. I see the difference between clean him and using him and it‚Äôs so fucking hard to reconcile the two.¬† 

I guess I just need someone to cosign me cutting it all off. I told him I was giving him one last chance after I od‚Äôd and he did everything I asked after that. This happened before but I just found out. My heart is just broken as fuck and I need someone to make me feel better right now. But, I gave him that one last chance to make shit right and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs holding onto.¬† 

Tell me I‚Äôm justified in saying I don‚Äôt give a fuck what I agreed to before I knew what he did. I love him when he‚Äôs clean but I want him to die when he‚Äôs using. I actually prayed that he would go to prison the last time because I couldn‚Äôt take that shit anymore. I'm not sad he‚Äôs going to go to prison. I‚Äôm sad because the person I thought existed doesn‚Äôt really exist and I've spent all this time on him.¬†","eff him, right?",missestill,2020-02-25 09:44:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f97x4w/eff_him_right/,5,1.0,4,3,1911

domesticviolence,"First post, I have no where else to go with this. I am 32/F/Married with a stepchild who does not live with us. 

Things have always been complicated between my husband and I but more so after we got married (crazy, jealous bio mom, financial mismanagement, little effort and failing hygiene on his part and for me, ‚Äúmild to moderate‚Äù military related PTSD which is apparently the cause of all of our problems despite it being well managed. He also likes to diagnose me with mental problems that I don‚Äôt have even though I am a professional with a good job, and otherwise have my shit together) but three months ago, after a nice night out with friends he attacked me. He was drunk, so much that he claims to not remember anything. 

It started with him being asked to leave the bar. He started trying to piss on a car parked on The side of the street as we walked. A security guard came out and started yelling at him as I was trying to lead him away And a little further down the street, he began urinating on me as I walked, laughing, calling me a ‚Äúfucking bitch.‚Äù Some friends had walked ahead and were out of sight, but my best friend and I continued walking to the parking garage with my husband. Once we were down on the very bottom floor, he turned around, looked me right in the eyes and said ‚Äúfuck you you fucking bitch. Fucking cunt.‚Äù And punched Me in the right temple. He continue punching me All over my head, at least a dozen times but not in the face. He dragged me down to the ground by my hair and pulled my hair back so far that I thought my neck was going to snap. I truly thought that I was going to die. He punched me in the chest at least four times And then punched me in the lower abdomen as well. I was trying to maintain my composure through all this and tried to tell him that he was hurting me and to stop, but every now and then he would look in my eyes and say ‚Äúfuck you, fuck you.‚Äù My friend intervened and gently restrained him. I got up and my friend told me to run And call the police. My husband was then spitting at me, reached out and ripped my skirt, and called me a ‚Äúfucking bitch.‚Äù Problem was, there was no reception so I would have to leave the area. I, under no circumstances, wanted to leave my friend alone with my husband. My friend had terribly overestimated his abilities and had His shirt ripped off, put in a headlock, and then punched repeatedly in the face when I realized that if I did not intervene he would be seriously injured also. I was able to help my friend get free and we both went up to the top of the garage to call for help. Plenty of witnesses, some crying. As I stood there At the opening of the garage waiting for my friend to return, I ran my fingers through my hair and huge clumps fell out. It was at that point I realized I was covered in bleeding abrasions. 

A couple things went through my mind. If he gets arrested, so do I. I work in a field where there is zero tolerance for even the perception of stepping out of line. Any contact with police could cost me my job. It is truly zero tolerance. Legal fees that I would have to pay for I‚Äôm sure, my house that I would lose. Maybe, even mugshots plastered across the Internet. I could lose literally fucking everything by having this happen to me, something I never saw coming. I went and got him out of there. 

I‚Äôve caught a lot of shit for what I did, Mainly because it decreases credibility in the eyes of the law but if police intervened I‚Äôd have been living in a box this winter.

When I woke up in the AM, my hand was swollen like a baseball, I had scratches and bruises all over my body. 

He has asked me to tell him what happened dozens of times, but believes that because there was alcohol involved he can‚Äôt truly be held accountable for that. He resents how incredibly fucking traumatizing this was for me and while initially apologetic, now tells people a wildly different story (he got in a fight with my male friend and I tried to be a hero and got knocked down, etc.) while saying that he doesn‚Äôt remember and can‚Äôt blindly take my word for what happened despite other people being there. Basically making me out to look over emotional and the aggressor in my own beating. 

Since then I have had to take a long hard look at my life with him and I no longer feel safe progressing with him.

The police never investigated. They forwarded the materials to the DA without any additional investigation and the DA decided, a couple days before Christmas, not to press charges but warned me that he might being criminal charges against me for harrassment because I published all these abusive texts online and tagged his friends, family, and coworkers.

Eventually he left or she called her apartment building security.  And she blocked him on all social media for a few days.

She spoke to her friends about what to do, apparently they ""like him"" so suggested giving him another chance.

They've been living together for two months and dating prior about six.  If this guy was this distraught at the potential break-up that he lashed out this early in the relationship then I worry about his next reaction.

She isn't exactly emotionally stable (bipolar diagnosis) and has on several occasions gone out of her way to emotionally hurt men she's in a relationship with.  

She moved overseas at a young age so it's not like I can confront this guy.

I've told her that if she needs to break up with him for real to not do it alone but to have friends there.  It's almost like they're back in that initial honeymoon period.

He has hit her in the past but she said he hasn‚Äôt hit her recently. Other than the other day when he kicked her in the chest with his boot during an argument.

I fear for her safety and the safety of their son. He has already told the child that ‚Äúmommy doesn‚Äôt love you‚Äù and other mean phrases.

I knew from the day I met him that there was something off about him. I told her that but she said there was nothing to worry about.

Flash forward to now. She is talking to an older gentleman who she seems to be falling for. He promises that he‚Äôs gonna divorce his wife and get my friend out of the apartment she shares with the abusive boyfriend/fianc√© and into a place with him. I really hope he does.

He has taken her bank card out of her purse and went to purchase things at the gas station while she was at work (the card was turned off because she just activated a new card a few hours before). He‚Äôll call her job and ask if she‚Äôs at work and tells them it‚Äôs an emergency that he needs to talk to her but it isn‚Äôt an emergency. He doesn‚Äôt have his drivers license and is about to be 30. He doesn‚Äôt have a job either so he literally sits at home all day long.

So why doesn‚Äôt she get the fuck out of there and get help is what you‚Äôre probably thinking right? She thinks that if she contacts someone from a domestic violence place that‚Äôll help her, she‚Äôll loose custody and they‚Äôll take her son away from her. So she has decided to play the game of being in a relationship with him and doing everything he asks until her gentleman friend can get things figured out.

He won‚Äôt leave her side while she‚Äôs on the phone. Like it‚Äôs ridiculous.

I will admit that she has hit him but in self defense because he would go after her first. She fears that he could bring it up another way saying she hit him first and that could result in them taking her parental rights if she called for help.

What can I do? I really can‚Äôt see myself sitting back and waiting for her and/or her child to get beat or even possibly killed.

I am unsure on how to process this stuff and need words of advice. I always felt it was my fault, as she (F21) would never apologise for anything that went wrong, it was always me. I would try and walk away but she would threaten to kill herself if I did. She would spit and attack me, and when I called her out on it, she would simply make an excuse to say it was justified. She would say things like ""Everyone says you are hitting above your weight with me"", so I would believe I would never get anyone as attractive or as ""loving"" as her. She would control what I wore and where we would go out too.

Three weeks ago I walked away, but the emotional abuse that made me dependant, made me crawl back.  The day before the breakup she begged and pleaded that I did not leave her (she was attacking me and being verbally abusive to me during the night). Then when I did it, her attitude changed to ""Thanks for the memories"". I asked her three times to talk but she would tell me she was done and didn't want it anymore.

I don't understand it. How can she go from hot to cold so quickly? Is this mental torture? A friend told me she was out last night and seemed happy. I am tired of feeling like my emotions have been messed up so badly. I have alot of family and friends who always told me they didn't like her angry attitude towards things.

domesticviolence,"So I told one of my house mates about what had happened to me regarding being physically abused by ex bf and he was supportive but since then he's started making rude comments about it. I have stopped speaking about this to him but he continues. For example there was a show on tv and couples we're arguing. He said something like ""oh if you're into that how come you claim to be a victim. "" Then he says oh just joking. It's not just that though. since I've moved in he's made constant advances towards me including asking me to sleep with him and commenting on my body constantly. I already told the landlady about it. She spoke to him but he only stopped for a week. He also held his phone up to me showing me a picture of him nude. I didn't want to see that at all. Do I just tell him myself to not talk to me or do that? I have tried other methods like not speaking to him at all and he just keeps saying hello until I speak to him. There is another housemate here who is nice to me but whenever we speak or hang out the other one always comes in the room to join in so I feel like I can't avoid him or his comments.

Relationship

PLEASE READ I KNOW ITS LONG I NEED A EAR TO LISTEN THIS IS MY LAST RESORT


So me and my ex knew each other since hs. I meet him through a friend we all three became best friends. Me and him started dating but before our relationship he told the whole entire school that his mom passed away, but not only that he made up a whole story of how she passed away he said in an house fire along with his cat. He keep this going one day I went into his fb I seen a profile with a lady who looks just like him, and him in the picture. Come to find out it was his mother I contacted him and ask him about it he quickly hurried of the phone called her to tell her to block us but I got in contact with her, and she confirmed she was his mom. I was furious because he had been staying at my house for months we grew so close. I understood the situation because she wasn‚Äôt in his life, but the fact that he keep the lie going to everyone in the school. One night with him being at my house he stated to me that he seen his mother ghost in my house and started crying. After that situation I told the mutual friend about it we confronted him he blocked both of us and stop speaking to us. He didn‚Äôt give us  an explanation we graduated but he didn‚Äôt and we end up not talking to him for three months. He just walked out my life after us hanging out everyday and him sleeping over ..,.

       Fast forward I was so sad the whole summer I didn‚Äôt even want to go out I felt he abandoned me when we grew a connection I was so sad then one day my cousin just contacted him he finally responded apologized to us both and he came back in my life. We ended up making it official he basically lived with me at the age of us being 17, because his father and him did not get along his dad was abusive and a dead beat. His mom spoke to him every couple of months but haven‚Äôt seen him in years and she lives 30 min away she is not on drugs or nothing it seems like she has her own life and kids somewhere else. When dating me and the third friend who was our bf had an incident he use to choose her over me with certain situations. I had a guy bf who I knew since middle school we never did anything together  I think he might be on the other side but when I told my best friend he texted me a heart to be petty and we were joking around about it ( he knew my best friend I made them meet he thought he was gay). My boy friend seen it he was pissed he end up taking me to a park down the block from my house and beat me up this is the first time I been through that also my father was sick dying or cancer at the time 

      I ended up telling the friend who was both of our mutual friend what was going on even though me and her was not in a good place because I kind of trusted her she knew both of us . She ended up asking him about it months later when me and her had a falling out  like he was going to admit to what he did. Her mom got into it and was accusing me of I guess lying about it, because I was still with  him after that. I had plenty of episodes of his abuse, she even witnessed one. Some things he did to me was one day I took too long to get dressed I was taking him out for his birthday she was their he slapped me in my face then apologized. He said he was having troubles with his past and that brought up memories of his parents. He broke up a time with me because our mutual friend said to choose between me or her but the breakup he did was not regular he had sexual intercourse with me then when I was waking up the next day to go to work he broke up with me dragged me out his house spit on me., and started beating me in his hallway. One time he beat me so much I thought I was going to die. I stayed with him for 5 years through all of this he spoke about my dead father, past situations that happen to me when I was a kid that I open up to him about. He beat me in-front his family members called me out my name in front of them. It was to a point of time he was not allowed at my house so I started going to his his father would hear me screaming and would just ignore it and turn his music up.

     Not to mention he was not working or going to school the whole 5 years I had to support the both of us I got nothing for my birthday Christmas our anniversary. The only time he ever bought me stuff was when he got a law suit when he turned 18. He got 35,000 he bought me an iPhone shoes and clothes and other stuff my mother would ask him for money sometimes because he was staying at my house for free I would stop her. One time we had a big argument he asked me for the stuff he brought me back I returned everything he ever bout in total on me and my mom he probably spent 5,000 on us and blew the rest in a couple of months. I know throughout the whole relationship I spent over 5,000 on him. After his money blew out and I was in college working and going to school he would get mad when I had money I would always give him but he felt that I owed him more because he claimed to have given me 30k when he blew it on himself and his friends. He would steal out my bank account every argument we had he would bring this money up


  He did so much stuff the list goes on but I‚Äôm not going to write all of that. Now I‚Äôm going to talk about the last two breakups we had over the course of 5 years every breakup we had has been by him about stuff like me not saying the right thing or me talking to someone he didn‚Äôt like. Or just for any reason. I would beg for him back because I loved him. I got attached to him he was their for me when my father died of cancer. I felt I put a lot of effort into this relationship. Pushing him to get his ged and finish school. I felt I couldn‚Äôt live without him he knew that he would sometimes say to be with him I would have to give him stuff and I did it. People around me was looking at me like I‚Äôm dumb because people started to find out what he was doing. I can‚Äôt explain it I just keep going back no matter what. He loved when I begged him and I did. He made me feel like no one else wanted me he told me that. After my dad died he was the only man I knew and trusted I just couldn‚Äôt give up on this. I started to get abandonment issues because of him. He made me feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have anyone else because he knew my situation. He always party every time we broke up.

   He use to ghost me the second to last breakup he left for a week over an petty argument I had to contact his uncle to ask him for him to call me. He made it seem like we was going to work stuff out then later that day he called back and just said we are done he doesn‚Äôt love me or want me anymore and to not contact him. I just said ok I was crying a lot but instead this time I left him alone changed my number deleted my fb.  I guess he didn‚Äôt expect it. I cried for days couldn‚Äôt eat sleep or nothing everyone thought I was going to kill myself, but I didn‚Äôt I fought through it. A month later I was at work I got a phone call it was him I keep hanging up he keep calling he said he was calling to check on me then he ended up crying on the phone for us to get back together I caved in. We both said we were going to work on stuff I did stuff in the relationship not cheating or anything small stuff like lying or if I spoke to someone he didn‚Äôt like females or tell them what was going on. We had minor issues he would put his hands on me but not as bad as before. He would still take my money without my permission. Everytime we broke up it was always a random female friend who popped up and confessed that they loved him or something. I was insecure he knew that only because at the beginning he was sleeping with many girls and just ghosting them before we started going out 

 The last breakup happen because we had an argument not serious ( December 2019) he went 2 days without talking to me. I was just upset because this was a normal thing he would always do just leave or stop talking to me for days to weeks when he didn‚Äôt feel like being bothered. Or if I would talk to him about things that he didn‚Äôt like. At this point I was just angry feed up I could admit. He works off a WiFi phone he called me and said go to his house then the phone got cut off his father let me in I waited in his room for 5 min I keep calling him he never answered. I never did this before but I hide his ps4 and took his laptop and left. I did not want it I did it because I was upset and that‚Äôs the only things he care about. I didn‚Äôt need nor want it I have three laptops, and I was also financially supporting him. 10 min into me walking to my house he called me I feel like he was at his house or around the area begging for me to come back and talk I was too upset and I felt like he was only calling for his stuff. He ended up coming to my house banging the door I wasn‚Äôt home I was outside clearing my head.  He claimed he was at a job that he supposedly got that day he wanted to surprise me it was located 2 hrs away from him. I knew he was lying he said he was going to show me proof of the job but never did. I know him he never made an attempt to work, and he wouldn‚Äôt travel that far. Me and his father had conversation his father confirmed that most likely he didn‚Äôt go he has lied in the past to his father about having a job when he was at his friend house smoking for days

   Over the past couple of days he tried to get me to meet up I was upset and refused, because I knew if it wasn‚Äôt for me having the stuff he wouldn‚Äôt even contact me. One day he came to my house after I told him not too acted like he was coming to talk by time he left I thought he was going to change. He left with my iPad and my Louis Vuitton scarf. After a couple of weeks we talked on and off he said that I had to work for him because what I did I admit I got my mom involved she seen how upset I was and they got into it I felt so bad he wanted me to come over I went spent three days over their. It was fun. We both agreed we were working on the relationship. When I got home we had a little argument nothing big really. He ghosted next I feel like he used these opportunities to ignore me and now thinking about it he was most likely talking to other girls or the girl best friend that we had in common that we both agreed not to speak too behind my back. We had sex when I was over their, so since he just disappeared it made me feel worse. I spent days calling him when he answered I would come on the phone yelling because you are ignoring me for days at a time for an minor argument I would call and call and call because he never said stuff was done and I already felt dumb because I had sex with him. Then when I called back it would take another two days for him to answer he would whisper and act like he was at a job we all knew he didn‚Äôt have he told me previous the job was done even though he never had it to begin with. Then when I would start yelling he hung up and made me seem like I was the problem like I didn‚Äôt have a right to be mad so after that I just keep repeatedly calling asking for my stuff back and he could have his. He finally answered and said he‚Äôs not giving me my stuff that‚Äôs at his house I will have to show a receipt to get it back it‚Äôs his. I told him since we are done just give me my stuff it doesn‚Äôt make sense to keep it if we are really done this time. I keep calling him he said he was bringing my stuff to my house then when I called him back he told me come to his house I refused because he was either going to hit me, and if something happened to me I know he would lie and say I came to his house to start problems. I told him I would have my cousin come and drop the stuff he said no. I called him again because I have no use of his laptop I never wanted it I have 3. And I don‚Äôt know his pw for his devices but he knew mines I just wanted my stuff back. He said to me stop calling him I‚Äôm a crazy bitch he don‚Äôt want me anymore and I‚Äôm lying about everything abusive he has done to me in the relationship. Days past I felt bad stupid I opened my legs to him again I was attached I felt like no one else wants me I felt lonely because he was the only person I would be around all the time. He just answered and repeated the same thing I asked him why would you invite me to your house have sex with me and make me use my money thinking you are going to change he said I was lying and I was being a bitter lying bitch because he didn‚Äôt want me leave him alone he is moving on I ruined his life.


   Now he is trying to make me look crazy infront of everyone I know that he most likely still talking to our girl ex best friend the girl that made him cut me off and thought I was lying about everything. I seen his uncle wrote something on Facebook about toxic people his mom liked the comment which she never does. So I know most likely he told them lies about me. His uncle doesn‚Äôt live in his  house anymore but I know he has an idea about some stuff, and it‚Äôs just like no matter what bad this guy does they are behind him. As far as his mother she lives 30 min away hasn‚Äôt seen him in 4-6 years she has a whole new life with a bf and I feel like kids that she‚Äôs hiding from him. I know he is either lying to them about how we broke up or why. He is trying to make me seem toxic and crazy to everyone, and I know if I go on Facebook and write the truth I have proof of him stealing money and marks from his abuse. They would think I‚Äôm doing that because I‚Äôm bitter or it would further prove his false accusations of me being crazy. His father and his father girlfriend knows the truth they heard what went on in his room they ignored it they didn‚Äôt give a shit if I died they would just turn the music up. I shouldn‚Äôt expect them too because I put myself in that situation and I keep going back to him. That was the biggest question why did I keep going back. I loved him that‚Äôs the only man I knew since my father died when my father was in the hospital on his dying bed with cancer he stuck by my side. I felt that without him I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through that without him. After that he just made me feel like I was the ugliest thing on earth he told me no one else will want me, and I would be alone he‚Äôs the only person I had. I don‚Äôt even want to get him in trouble or embarrass him by telling my side of the story I know everyone he tells the story too is going to  think I‚Äôm just a psycho liar and if I explain it they will just ask that one question why didn‚Äôt you leave? I don‚Äôt know how to heal he knows how to hurt me and I feel like he did not want to give me my stuff because he felt like that was a way to make me keep contacting him while he keeps trying to make me look crazy I just have no choice but to leave it alone like I did the last time and when I did that he called me crying saying why didn‚Äôt I fight for him back, but why would I keep calling someone who told me leave them alone, calling me a crazy bitch infront of people so I can prove his point. I HAVE A LAPTOP HE HAS A BED I BOUGHT A FLATSCREEN MY IPAD MY LOUIS VUITTON SCARF AND MORE. I told him I can have someone drop his stuff he said no.

I JUST FEEL HURT AND LOST I CHANGED MY NUMBER AND JUST DELETED ALL MY SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS TRIGGERED THE ABANDONMENT ISSUES HE GAVE ME. He knows he‚Äôs won he always told me no one will ever believe me, and now I have these thoughts in my head what if he treats another girl better than me, or if he changes and get a job and finish school like I always pushed him to do. That‚Äôs all I  wanted our girl bf at the time seen how much I did for him. I always made sure he ate everyday when his own mother didn‚Äôt even do that or even our girl bf he said I ruined his life when all I been trying to do is help and push him to do good because no one else in his life including his parents was not. I know him  the real him he has cried to me about everything he went through as a child and stuff that happen to him as he was older. Everyone that doesn‚Äôt know the truth is looking at me like I‚Äôm toxic but doesn‚Äôt know what I been through. The only people that are toxic in his life are his parents his father supplies him with weed 24/7 and is encouraging his lazy habits of him not wanting to do nothing with his self and his mother is just not around. His father had drugs in his house which got their house raided and he got arrested because of his dad but I‚Äôm toxic when all we argued about mostly is me trying to help him get a job and get his ged and him lying about going to the appointments. Guess what if he actually does get his stuff together now that I‚Äôm out the picture that‚Äôs going to prove his uncle point and other people he is most likely lying too point that I am the toxic thing when they had no idea what I went through. Knowing him he doesn‚Äôt even want to work or do anything with himself but not that I‚Äôm out the picture he would do that just to hurt me

domesticviolence,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm posting in the right place but I really had nowhere else to turn. 

I‚Äôm scared right now that my fianc√© will hurt me and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it.

We have been together for nearly 9 months and we got engaged officially just recently. He‚Äôs from a different country to me, but we met in his country of origin. I‚Äôm working here and we met online through a dating app. 

In the beginning, our major issue was money as he isn‚Äôt working right now. I am, and I don‚Äôt mind footing the bill if it means we can see each other and actually have a relationship. And that was what I thought I wanted back then. He felt from the beginning, that his role was to contribute something to the relationship but we aren‚Äôt talking a fortune here. Just enough to go out on a date or stay somewhere together at the weekend. 

He has a really tumultuous relationship with his family which has resulted in a lot of anger issues. As we got closer, he opened up about how he‚Äôd been violent in the past to previous partners. Kicking to the ground, punching, hitting. He told me he hadn‚Äôt done it in years. I was really apprehensive when he told me this, but like many before me, I thought he‚Äôd changed. 

Before this, I had been close to ending the relationship as he had told me that my false eyelashes were too long, he didn‚Äôt like how I smelt, he didn‚Äôt like the brand of cigarettes i smoked. He also said that he thought my make up was too strong and maybe people would think badly of me. He said that women here would love to be white, so that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have to do anything to look good.

I had a fit and he claimed it was just an ‚Äòexample‚Äô. It happened once more after that, about the same issue.

I knew he had major trust issues from past girlfriends too. I‚Äôd told him if he needed to check my phone he could, but somehow he never wanted to. He was quick to complain if I was being ‚Äòsecretive‚Äô with it however, like I moved off an IG page too quickly. We regularly stayed at an Airbnb together at weekends, and one day, he asked me if I‚Äôd been there without him. I said no, of course not, why? He said he‚Äôd noticed some cigarette butts that were the same brand as mine, by the balcony of another room. He thought I had been there with another guy. I had not. It was the first time I had been accused of anything like this and it just didn‚Äôt sit well with me throughout. 

However, I didn‚Äôt listen to the warnings or pay attention to the red flags. Because fast forward, and our relationship becomes more serious. We decided to move back to my home country together, with me sponsoring his visa. He doesn‚Äôt work, and our visa depends on income. I said I would take two jobs to meet the threshold, and I expected he would make an effort to. He did not. He just said that if he took a job as a cab driver for example, it would have to be ‚Äòworth it‚Äô, ie he has another job on the side which was ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt get any job however. 

This all made me quite worried, I was focused on getting that visa, planning how we would survive etc. I opened up to him about how I had suffered from anxiety in the past, and I told him I was feeling a bit worried now. His response was to turn it into a huge fight, whereby he said I wasn‚Äôt able to handle our situation and that he didn‚Äôt care about my anxiety anymore. 

So from that point, I shut off. There were other huge rows where he called me a dick, he told me to fuck off. Countless, countless rows. It was so bad that eventually, I just became numb. He told me I was bothering him, I was negative, I was draining him. The whole litany. 

But recently, it escalated. A colleague of mine messaged me asking if we can meet up to discuss some materials for his class. I initially agreed to but then realized that my partner would not like this. We had fought constantly up until this point, so I was exhausted by the fighting and didn‚Äôt want to start another. I told my colleague that I was busy in the end and could I call instead. My partner discovered that my colleague had text me and I was so scared about another fight, that I lied to him about the plan to meet (which I changed). In any case, he absolutely terrified me that night. He was calling my phone nonstop, texting me. It was the first time I have ever felt physically threatened. He started to say I was in deep shit, and from his past experience, I shouldn‚Äôt try and avoid him. 

He kept badgering me and badgering me, calling me constantly at work. By this time, I was seriously concerned for my safety and I was terrified of what would happen if I told him the truth. 
But eventually, I did tell him the truth. He ended it of course, he said ‚Äòbitch go fuck yourself‚Äô after saying I can go and spread my legs anywhere I want. 
Yet now, he‚Äôs been calling me and texting me, seeming to want to work things out but once I answer the phone, he eventually begins to say how this is the worst thing anyone could have done to him, I ruined his life, I wasted his time etc. In his last message, he asked to meet and u said I was feeling intimidated, in case there was another fight and would happen. His response was ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt guarantee anything because you can‚Äôt guarantee shit either‚Äô Im scared, really scared, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like he might hurt me.",Scared and unsure,JamaicaInn1921,2020-02-22 14:20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f7t3u7/scared_and_unsure/,8,1.0,3,3,1021
domesticviolence,"I feel crazy.  I got the strength to leave a relationship that wasn't for me 2 years ago.  He was abusive.  I mean no he didnt punch me or anything like that.  But he did put me in a chokehold a couple of times.  Ironically I still blame myself for those incidents.   
He always said it was because I didnt love him enough.  I wasnt perfect and I could've shown more affection it just never seemed right.
After I left him, he tried to get back with me for a little over a year.  We would go back and forth until last November he just stopped.  No more call or texts.  He called last month to schedule an appt with me ( I own a tax office)  but he scheduled the appt in March.  Which I thought was odd.  But why would he do that.  Does he want to throw his new relationship in my face when he comes in.  Or does he really just want to get his taxes done.  Maybe I'm thinking too much into it.
But now I see hes in a new relationship.   They look happy and shes a cop.  I cant help but to wonder will he do the same with her as he did to me.  It seems like hes changed.  He posts biblical scriptures everyday and looks happy.  Why cant I just be happy for him?

domesticviolence,"I was in a relationship for two years.  I knew she had a troubled past but at the time it seemed like she overcame her issues and had her life together.  Long story short after about 6 months things started going downhill.  She became very controlling and emotionally abusive.  Eventually she got physical with me in front of my kids.  I wasn't being a victim any longer - I had left before as well because it wasn't the 1st time she hit me but I ended up going back (I've been away for 6 months now so I've done alot of research about the cycle of abuse and understand what the up and down cycle does to you emotionally as well as biochemically - it really is like an addiction)

So after this last incident I made arrangements to permanently leave - I owed it to myself and my children - this person was toxic and doesn't deserve me.  Well after the incident where I sustained an injury she left the house.  She was gone for two days and during this time I packed as much stuff as I could.  Scheduled a moving company to come in the days to follow.  I get a text from her finally after 2 days saying she wanted to come to the house to grab some clothes.  I left because I didn't want to be around her again and drove to my parents a hour away with everything I packed the preceding two days.

Hours later I get a call from the police department that a protection order was filed against me.  Upon arriving at the station I was arrested after being served.  I was not questioned or interviewed by the police.  They did not try to validate any of her statements yet took her word that I allegedly pushed her and supposedly because off a bruise on her hand said it was enough to establish probable cause.  At the time of the arrest the police would not provide me with any information.  They told me the charge but all details would be provided at the arrangement AFTER I was already arrested.

At this point I've received the police reports and pictures and there is no visual bruise at all.  Yet in her testimony she admits I had a bloody nose but says I got it because i walked into a door.  No BS this is how she explains it away and the police seemed to buy into that explanation.

How is it legal to arrest someone without even getting their side of the story.  How is this due process of law.  Also with the restraining order I wasnt able to get the rest of my things until a court order was obtained.  I had so much furniture and belonging there for myself and children.  She denied my entry several times with a police escort so my attorney filed the motion for the order.

I almost lost my job (I'm a financial professional) because of this allegation yet because of my length of service and after supplying police reports and the details surrounding the flimsy allegation they cleared me to continue working.

So now I'm 7500 in the hole will attorney fees - been pulled into court numerous times at this point - a DV case can take a year.  She has called and emailed me (even with a no contact order that she initiated) 15 times at this point and the DA basically said they didnt care its only illegal if I contact her not the other way around.

domesticviolence,"I broke up with my long term boyfriend 2 years ago. It was extremely abusive. The combination of duration and ordeal meant that I spent a long time trying to manage the damage. It was like a marriage. I feel like I am divorced and I feel like I have this 6 year period of my life where I achieved very little, had no fun, no hobbies and didn't go out and do things that normal people in their 20s/30s do.

Fast forward to last summer. I met a kind, gentle, quiet guy and over-romanticised him. We tried to make a go of things but it ended in December. Why? Well, he had a pretty intense aspergers situation that created so many difficulties. I found myself behaving like an abused, submissive type like I was with my ex in order to prevent new guy becoming too stressed. He found lots of 'normal' things incredibly stressful. I liked the way he didn't bombard me with qs so I could hide most of my ordeal with prior ex. 

Anyway, biology and hormones... I still want to meet and connect with someone. I keep telling myself it's OK to feel like I deserve a loving relationship, friendships and a good career. I don't think I am better than anyone, I just don't think I am worse.. and so, I should also be allowed to have normal, stable things.

I am looking for work at the moment. I live with my mom while I look for work. I am so ashamed of this. My esteem will increase when I am working. But I realised when looking at 'questions to ask on a date' articles that I do not dare ask any of them because I do not want to be asked the same in return. Why? Because I have a gap. I had a period of no joy, no hobbies and no time to do things just for me because I was controlled and coerced. I feel like dating me would be like dating someone who has spent almost a decade in a coma. What the hell do I do? I don't want to scare anyone with the truth.

Am I the only person in the world who has had a period of their life that has meant they couldn't build/grow as much as a person - socially or career wise? I had barely come to terms with my father's suicide when I met my ex. So even my teens/early twenties were about 'overcoming' rather than discovering my life passions. I am so ashamed that I feel so passionless.","Domestic violence in my past, and how it stops me moving on. Anyone else have this?

domesticviolence,"Hi hello. I live in a town home community and I have a dog that I talk for walks fairly often.  While walking there‚Äôs one neighbor who I‚Äôve seen get in multiple arguments with a man that I‚Äôm assuming is her husband. I‚Äôve seen them get pretty heated but two instances stood out a lot. The first was a few months ago when the man stormed out of the house screaming at her and calling her things I‚Äôm not going to make anyone read here. He was screaming in front of the kids and the woman and it seemed more intense than a normal argument. Last night though I was walking past again as they both get out of the car and I couldn‚Äôt catch what they were saying but I overheard the man saying ‚Äúyou f****** slapped me‚Äù and then crowding the woman as she tried to open the door with him on top of her going ‚Äúget in the god damn house‚Äù over and over‚Äù.

I feel like I should throw this in here so I don‚Äôt just sound like an overly nosy neighbor but I‚Äôm not sure.

domesticviolence,"Hi everyone this is a throw away account and I‚Äôm still shaken up about the situation so I apologize for terrible format and any misspellings or grammatical errors. 

Yesterday at around 12pm I (21F) was laying on my sisters‚Äô bed (we share a room the three of us since we‚Äôre financially tight) watching YouTube videos. I was tired from having had a class early that morning and having slept only four hours the previous night. So my oldest sister comes in (25) and she starts demanding I get out of the room because she has to ‚Äúmake a phone call.‚Äù I tell her to go to my parents room since there is no noise coming from the gardeners there and that I‚Äôm tired and don‚Äôt wanna move. She keeps telling me in her rude tone to fuck off the bed and leave. I ignore her because I don‚Äôt want things to escalate and I‚Äôm hoping she‚Äôll give up and just leave to my parent‚Äôs room. She doesn‚Äôt.

She starts taking all the blankets and pretending she gonna make the bed (she NEVER makes it, ever) and she‚Äôs pulling them off the bed in a way where they are purposely hitting me while she‚Äôs still going off shouting repeatedly to get out. I sit up, irate, and I tell her to remove the blankets from my bed so I can get to it (I sleep on a loft and the blankets were on the ladder). She is yelling profanities at me and repeating to get off and ‚Äúmove!‚Äù I‚Äôm just waiting for her to remove the blanket. Finally, she does and she starts telling me off and I‚Äôm past my limit, so I yell at her that if she had wanted me to go to my bed sooner she should have removed the blankets when I first asked her to and then in my anger I call her a ‚Äúfucking dumb ass.‚Äù She punches me on the head while I start climbing and so I jump off and I turn to her. She tries to swing again but I catch her arm and I‚Äôm trying to shove her away now but she goes for my throat and it holding it with her nails digging in and her other hand holding my skinny ass arm. I lean my body weight onto her and we stumble on her bed. She‚Äôs not letting go of my throat and she has murder in her eyes, her body shaking with anger. I am fucking terrified. I try punching her but she‚Äôs got quite a grip on my throat. 

My parents hear the commotion from the living room and they rush in, my dad ready to beat us with his belt. She finally lets go. I‚Äôm shaking catching my breath when they ask us what happened. I try telling them and she says I laid hands on her first. She‚Äôs also telling them off and name calling them. My mom just asks me to leave the room. Everyone is angry but no one does anything. I‚Äôm crying in the living room and I order a lyft to my boyfriend‚Äôs house because I don‚Äôt know where else to go. I couldn‚Äôt help but feeling that I should‚Äôve called the police but I was scared to ‚Äúdestroy her life‚Äù since she aspires to become a teacher and I‚Äôm also afraid of being shunned by my family for calling the police on my own sister. I know she has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while now, but me having bipolar disorder know that mental illness is not an excuse for violence but I doubt my family would understand that. I think something else may be wrong with her in the mental department as her behaviors are largely anti social and she beats her dog. 

Today everyone is acting like this crazy bitch didn‚Äôt just try to choke me to death yesterday and I feel abandoned by my parents and sad but also scared and angry. Last night I slept in the living room out of fear with my knife under my pillow. I woke up as soon as she got out of bed and I can‚Äôt even look at her. Please I am asking for advice and I am too afraid to call involve the police. Yes, she left marks on my throat and scratches and yesterday my head hurt a lot from her punches.

domesticviolence,"I [23M] had been with my boyfriend [30M] for over 2 years. It started out great; we had a very strong connection, talked all the time, travelled together, and supported one another emotionally. I realized that he drank a lot early in the relationship, but didn't see any red flags since I was a young college student and was comfortable with party/drinking culture. He moved in with me after losing a job, and I could definitely see his drinking more as a problem than as something he just did for fun. I would tell him how I wasn't comfortable with the amount he drank, but he would always refute what I said and claim it was 'normal' and it was like he was on vacation since he wasn't working. He would basically walk to the liquor store every day while I was at class and pick up a few things  such as wine, a pint of vodka, a few of those little airplane shots and would do this every day. He would hide some stuff from me because he knew I didn't like it. Sometimes he would get too drunk and start saying hurtful things to me at night, and would mess up my ability to get school work done. 

After I graduated I moved away for a job, he started working again at that point but lost that job due to an injury and had to come move in with me again. This time his drinking was much worse. I kind of excused it because I knew he was in pain from the injury, but it became out of control. He was Ubering to the liquor store every day when I left for work, sometimes buying as much as a fifth of vodka and drinking the whole thing. I knew this wasn't good for him and certainly wasn't good for me. I was basically coming home to a pissed off drunk man every day and would be subject to verbal/emotional abuse on a nightly basis. He would try and hide his drinking from me but it was always obvious he was trashed. The first time he hit me was when I poured out the remaining bit of vodka from his bottle when I got home from work. I continued to just try and take care of him but he would frequently tell me I wasnt doing enough. He drunkenly hit me a few other times but it was never that bad.

One night I came home from work and he was super drunk (I left him cash for food but he spent it at the liquor store I suppose). We started argueing about something, and I got up to just leave our apartment for a bit but he took my phone and wouldn't give it back. I tried to forcibly remove it from his hands but he just started punching me in the face. I managed to grab the phone and got to the other side of our room but he managed to pin me down on the couch, kept hitting me and started strangling me while yelling that he was gonna kill me. I was able to get out of it and locked myself in the bathroom until he calmed down. I didn't hit back at all in this altercation, just tried to get away. I basically packed up my essential stuff and left, and never returned. 

This was about 3 weeks ago and I've been living in my car ever since. I told my friends and my family about the incident and my situation now, they are very supportive but live far away. I can't help but feel kind of stupid about this whole thing. First of all, I knew the relationship wasnt going well and I shouldnt have let it persist as long and it did. I guess he made me feel kind of trapped in a way. I continued to love him despite the drinking, the way I was treated, and the way I was expected to cater to his every need. Also I feel kind of stupid leaving him on the basis of physical abuse, since we are a gay couple and I am definitely a little bigger/more athletic than him. 

I don't really know how to process my feelings about this. I am experiencing a mix of emotions from relief to sadness to anger to regret. I know I made the right decision to leave but I still have feelings for him and hope the best for him. He wouldn't have done any of this to me if he didn't drink. I am definitely worried about him being okay on his own. I have texted him saying that it is over and that he needs to get support from family/friends for now on. He has been messaging me every day now saying that he wants me back and he loves me but I am not budging. Yesterday he started getting nasty and called me a horrible person for leaving and started making jabs at my biggest insecurities, and saying no one will ever love me because of my flaws. I feel really terrible now.

 I just figured I'd put my story up here because this is a very weird time in my life and I don't really know what to feel. Thank you.

Edited and updated to add a list of potential red flags! See list at bottom.


I‚Äôve been seeing a man for a few months now that I really clicked with and thought there might be a future with. But over time I started to notice little things about his personality and his actions that concerned me.

Over the last two weeks I saw more and more of his true self beneath the charming exterior: the controlling behavior, the manipulation, the emotional immaturity, and the inability to accept responsibility. There were more but those red flags were enough. 

I ended it. And I am proud of myself for not falling back into that trap, for being self aware enough to end it before the abuse started. The person I was 10 years ago would have never seen the signs, 7 years ago I would have ignored them until it was too late, 5 years ago I was letting myself be used and disrespected in a relationship going nowhere. 

But not this time. Not anymore. He needs help and I deserve better.

domesticviolence,"My (40F) spouse (44M) has been verbally abusive since we've first gotten together.  It used to be far and few between, however.  When he was working, he was often busy and happy, and didn't have all this time to just sulk and pick me apart.  It's become unbearable lately, compounded by the fact that we no longer live in the city and are more isolated.  He's just a miserable person who refuses to get a job or at least a hobby.  I'm the sole bread winner, and even though we have more than enough money for both of us to live on, he makes all the decisions about how we spend it and penny pinches everything to death.  If I were to spend money on something without asking first, he'd flip out.

In some of his darker moments, he has threatened to kill me, or to kill himself.  He has often broken things in the house, or threatened to break one of my work computers.  He is a little hard of hearing and often can't understand what people say, which makes him angry.  If he can't understand something I've said, he immediately starts screaming at me and mocking me.  If we get into a fight in the car, he will swerve on the road, slam the breaks or just drive like a maniac to scare me.  He absolutely cannot take a joke, and will become angry if he thinks someone is ""disrespecting him"" in that way (by joking).  

He also has a very bad reaction to surprises or being startled.  We have an old house on our property that's falling apart.  We went to look it a few months back, to see if maybe there was something we could salvage from it.  He had walked into one of the rooms, and I was looking at the floorboards in the doorway, from outside the house.  I accidentally dropped a board and he immediately flipped out, screaming, ""how could you do that!  you made me think the house was falling!"" and as I was looking down, the next thing I knew sever pain in my head, and tasted blood in my mouth.  He had thrown a board across the room and hit me across the forehead.  I almost fell down backwards.  I felt dizzy and sick.  He was still screaming like some kind of ape, but I couldn't see what he was doing or make it out.  I had screamed out in pain, which somewhat slowed him down, but he still wasn't that concerned.  I started screaming back that I was leaving and started heading towards the house.  He followed.  He kept begging me not to leave, to let him see what he'd done, and he was ""horrified.""  I kept telling him ""f\*\*\* you, I'm leaving"" through tears and eventually we made it to our house.  He kept putting ice on my head and was somewhat apologetic, but I wasn't saying anything back.  I was still dizzy and in shock.  My head was super swollen.  When he wasn't getting the response he wanted he started saying things like ""just wait until you do something to me- I'm going to celebrate on it.""  Of course I reminded him that I've never thrown anything at him, or acted like that ever.  He kept saying it was an accident, but eventually conceded that he knew I was in the direction of that piece of wood he threw at me.   Even days later, he was still mad at me for ""making him feel bad"" about my getting injured. 

Sadly, I think I should have called the police then.  I didn't only because my family was coming to visit us in two days and I didn't want to upset the timeline.  I thought maybe when they were here visiting things would be better.  He was normally OK when family or other visitors came, but he was really awful during this trip.  On the bright side I was finally able to come clean with my family about just how awful he is, plus it made explaining the bruise on my forehead much easier.

It's impossible living with him lately.  Everything is my fault.  Everything...  I know it might sound dramatic, but sadly, this is how it is in his mind.  He refuses to take responsibility for his actions.  His apologies are non-existent.  He's told me that he feels it's ""his right to correct"" people or bully them if they do something stupid.  He's just horrible and now it's to the point where it's not even livable being with him.  He doesn't really have any friends.  He has one friend from his 20s that he talks on the phone with once in a while, but he yells even at him every now and then for ""not making sense when he talks"", ""talking about stupid things"", or ""talking like a highschooler.""  

I know I need to leave.  I just need to figure out when and how.  It's complicated because we have a farm, and I'm afraid of what will happen to the livestock if I just leave.  It's becoming unbearable though, and I'm afraid of what he might do.",Unsure of what to do,justwantpeace12,2020-02-18 17:38:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f5vhmc/unsure_of_what_to_do/,4,0.81,3,5,908
domesticviolence,"He lives on the same street as me so I'm not really surprised but it caught me off guard. I was walking back from the store and he was walking my direction, probably on the way to the store. I could see him walking my way so I went into a side street under a light. He had already seen me. He then walked further down the street and crossed the crossing area to the opposite side of the road and went on about his way. I think I looked scared and it was obvious that I avoided him. That scared the hell out of me because I hadn't seen him for over a week after him choking me and texting/calling me. I don't know if him leaving me alone means I won't need an order on him but I'm still trying to get up the courage to get one.

domesticviolence,"Hello all,

I could really use some advice or some words of encouragement. 

About 2 years ago I left my abusive boyfriend. It was probably one of the hardest things I have done and I'm still dealing with the repercussions of his mental and physical abuse. 

Anyway, today I got a message from a friend who has mutual friends with my ex. Apparently my ex died suddenly in a car crash recently. I don't have anymore information than that.

I feel so strange I immediately had a panic attack after hearing the news. Now I've mostly calmed down but I still feel weird. It's like a mixture of sadness anxiety and honestly relief which makes me feel worse. I'm also so worried about our dog we had together I hope he's being taken care of. Please help.",Ex Abuser Suddenly Dead,Mystiyful,2020-02-18 01:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f5j7k6/ex_abuser_suddenly_dead/,9,1.0,5,4,135
domesticviolence,"In February of 2019, the divorce between my parents was final. A few months later, my mom introduced me to her new boyfriend - a man I had never met before. I didn't like him at first. I mean, who would be willing to accept a new man in their mother's life just months after the end of a nearly 30 year relationship? 

I tried to like him. But something kept tugging at the back of my mind, telling me something was off. I ignored it and tried to convince myself it was just me not wanting anything new. But then that voice turned out to be right. 

I was at work one night sometime in November, when my phone rang. It was too late to be anything casual, and my concern grew seeing it was my mom.  I stepped out back to answer and was greeted with hysterical sobbing. 

She hadn't meant to call me, but I was in her favorites list and was right next to the person she had meant to call. I made her tell me what was wrong before my imagination went wild. 

Her new boyfriend had hit her. They had both gotten drunk, and gotten into a fight, and he had broken several bones in the side of her face. She had left the house and called the police, but when she came back he was gone. Scared and alone, she had tried to call a friend to come get her, but had called me by mistake. 

Fast forward a week or so. 

She's back together with him. She says she can fix him, she loves him. He just needs help and support, and she just needs to stay sober. 

My mother used to work at a domestic abuse shelter. These red flags should be as clear to her as they are to me, but for some reason they're not. But I keep my mouth shut, and try to support her. 

The end of January, 2020. My grandmother calls me, which is highly unusual. She tells me my mom's in the hospital, her boyfriend's been arrested, and she can't tell me anything else. 

So I wait. Losing my mind with worry. Two days go by.

My mother finally calls me to tell me she's home. Her (now ex) boyfriend had literally, actually, physically tried to kill her. Broke bones in her chest and face, bruised and damaged her windpipe. He literally choked her and stomped on her chest. She broke both hands fighting back. Her face was so swollen she couldn't see, and sent my brother to live with my dad until she was recognizable again. 

The ex went to prison. He hasn't been sentenced yet, but they expect between two and ten years in a state prison.

I guess my reason for posting this is to find some peace. I live across the country from her (I have for nearly two years now) and somehow I feel responsible. I should have told her how I felt when I met him. I should have been more firm with her the first time. 

She sent me a picture of the day she was released from the hospital, and it's all I can see when I think about her. It was meant to be a precursor to ""look how much better I look now!"" But it made me sick, and angry. 

I feel so alone in this. My own boyfriend's parents are happily married, and have been for nearly 40 years. None of my friends have ever gone through anything like this. How do I cope and get past this? Please, help me stop torturing myself.",My mom's abuse,tossawayposter,2020-02-18 03:43:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f5lgre/my_moms_abuse/,0,1.0,2,3,609
domesticviolence,"The court will not believe abuse against me or the children. CPS has been called numerous times but could not substantiate (were willing to say off the record they believed us, but needed to meet a certain standard). The judge cannot see it and won't talk to even the teenager who was abused the most. I have photos of bruises (they say photoshopped). I have videos of the kids talking about being abused (inadmissible because the court will not allow the children to testify). I have notes from the children and pictures (also inadmissible). One child was molested while my ex was in the room (I have photos of the room and the molester is serving a three year sentence; they say it wasn't my ex so it doesn't matter). I have doctor's notes that the children have come home dehydrated and without food (doctors are very expensive to call to court, so this is currently inadmissible). I have friends they've talked to about it (but it's seen as ""biased""). The same is true for my abuse. One of my children's therapists will testify they have been abused; the other children are not allowed therapy because my ex shares custody and will only permit therapy if my ex is present in the room. 

Many of the ""professionals"" involved won't believe even that I was abused, let alone the children, and I have journals, death threats written in my ex's handwriting, photographs, people willing to testify. Nobody cares, and, if they did, violence against a spouse doesn't seem to matter. Now my ex is abusing the children, including over-identifying my oldest as the same as myself. My ex goes to court and testifies that my oldest is psychotic, needs serious mental health help, and cannot be trusted. And court seems to believe it, even over the testimony of her therapist!

domesticviolence,"Can someone please tell me what I can do about this? My heads been very messed up and I've no idea what is real or not anymore.

My ex boyfriend sexually abuses me. We are not together anymore but I still live in the same house. I can't afford to move out on my own. We have a 1 yr old son and my ex constantly tells me that if I move out I can't take my son with me because he will go for full custody and win and I'll never see him again. 

I am so very distressed. My son is my life! I love that kid more than anything. I'm so terrified of losing him. 

Me and my son sleep in a different room. But my ex won't ever let me shut the door says it's his house he makes the rules. He'll come into my room at night and just demand sex. He hits me when I try hiding from him. Everytime I always say no and try to make him leave. He's a pretty big guy and can be very intimidating. It's hard to fight him off of me and I usually never can. it's also very traumatising since I'm trying to be quiet so I don't wake Bub up because I don't want him to see something like that. 

I threaten to call police but he just laughs and says I wouldn't because then I'd lose my son üòî 

He has videos on his phone of me doing some illegal drugs and doing sexual things. But these videos are from ages ago and I'd never do anything like that now that I have my son! He says it dosent matter and that he can report the videos anytime he likes and I'd lose all custody of my son and go to jail. And that he would never let me see him again. 

I don't understand what I'm suppose to do. I'm so terrified of going to anyone for help or reporting anything in case they take my son away. He's not in danger I'd never put him in any danger I'm just so scared of losing him.

domesticviolence,"I live in a set of apartments. A couple live right next to me and the walls are paper thin I can hear everything. 

I'm not home much during the day but I always hear them arguing in late afternoon into the night. On days I have off I don't hear much so I think they're both gone all day and are only home in afternoons. 

When I listen to them arguing (and I'm not trying to pry but they're pretty loud so it's harder not to listen) it's clear that the guy is abusing her. I can hear her begging for him to stop hitting her. Things like that. When I first moved and heard them I knocked on there door to make sure everything was ok. The girl answered the door and said she was fine. So I left it alone 

But the other night I woke to what I thought was someone knocking on my door and crying? I went outside and it was the lady next door but she wasent knockin on my door she was knocking on her own door. Turns out her boyfriend had kicked her out at nearly 2 in the morning in freezing cold and she was only in her undies and a shirt. Not even any socks or shoes or anything right and ive got a jumper on and everything and I'm still cold so she must've been freezing. She told me he had her phone and keys and everything in her and wasent letting her back in. 

I offered her to come in to my place out of the cold. But she dident want to which is understandable since I'm a guy who lives alone and she dident know me. She also dident want to take anything from me I offered her clothes and to use my phone but I think she was a bit scared of me so didn't want anything from me. 

Anyway he eventually let her back in and I went back to sleep. But woke up later to the guy screaming at her and I could hear things being broken. 

That morning when I was on my way out to work I saw the girl again she looked very messed up had a swollen face and everything. I told her I could ring the police so she can get help. She told me not to. I asked her why and she just said to leave her alone basically. 

So I've been leaving her alone but the arguing seems to be getting worse it honestly sounds like the guy is gonna kill her or something. 

Is there anything I can do to help ? I know she dosent want help but I feel bad not doing anything 

I'm moving out of the complex soon and I feel so bad that I haven't helped this girl yet. 

I was thinking of just calling the police but I know they can't do anything if the girl refuses help right? And I also don't want to make things worse for the poor girl.

domesticviolence,"I started seeing my girlfriend in early August. Everything was great for the first few weeks until mid September when I discovered she had a drinking problem. She called me out of the blue one night and told me I needed to pick her up from a bar. I arrive, she‚Äôs drunk and hurling insults at me about how it took me too long to get there, how terrible I am, etc. She continues insulting me on the way home, walks in my house, and blacks out on the couch. I went to bed, a few hours later she climbed in bed and told me how sorry she was for what she did, cried, and told me it would never happen again.

Fast forward to today, there‚Äôs been around 15 of these episodes in the last 6 months. She gets drunk, turns aggressive and at times, violent. She also destroys things in my house. She‚Äôs broken a few cabinets, torn down shower curtains, tore one of my shirts in half, scuffed walls and knocked over lamps. Recently she took my briefcase, dumped out the contents on the floor (notebook, wireless mouse, papers, pens) and poured a glass of water on them. Also, she‚Äôs no longer apologetic about her actions. The morning after her latest rampage, she sent me a text and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt even think about talking to me today‚Äù. 

In November, we were walking home from a bar and she punched me several times in the back. Just last week, during one of her drunken rampages, she threw both of our cell phones at me then tossed my iPad across the room. I picked up my phone and locked myself in my room. She chased me to my room, banged on the door and demanded I let her in. I opened the door as I thought she was going to break it. She told me she ‚Äúknew what I was doing‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt let me call the cops on her. She took my phone and stampeded off to the other side of the house. The next morning I told her to leave and she was furious. She has no place to go as she lives with me, but I wasn‚Äôt putting up with the abuse anymore. She calls me the next day and asks if she can come over that night as she‚Äôs tired and doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go. I let her stay, she refused to talk about her behavior and just wants everything to go back to normal. 

I‚Äôve offered to send her to a counselor and cover the cost, which she refuses. I spent an hour with a counselor and explained the situation, they believe she binge drinks to mask the trauma of her past. I also offered to attend AA with her and she agreed once, however, never followed through. She blames her drinking on me as I have a significantly higher income than she does and states I ‚Äúwatch her suffer‚Äù. She believes that if I truly loved her I would help her with things such as paying for her school, buying a new car, etc. This is nothing more than manipulation in my eyes. Keep in mind, she lives with me and does not contribute towards the mortgage, groceries, nights out, etc. 

I cannot even have a conversation with her regarding her drinking, she shuts it down immediately. At this point, is there any other option than leaving? Our relationship is incredible when she‚Äôs sober and we get along extremely well. However, when she drinks, all bets are off. 

Lastly, as hard to believe as it may be, her ex was physically abusive toward her. She‚Äôs traumatized by it which is why it‚Äôs so hard for me to comprehend her abuse towards me. She also had a somewhat difficult upbringing as she never met her father and her mother struggled to provide basic needs for her. I blame a lot of her behavior on her past and view her as a victim of it, which is part of the reason I‚Äôm still with her. I truly just want her to be happy and succeed in life, however, it‚Äôs becoming hard for me to believe she has any regard for me.

2/17 update: we attended two AA meetings last week. I thought she received them well. Things were fine until Saturday, one of her friends blew her off for lunch and she started an argument with me as a result. Things were pretty bad, she left Sunday and didn‚Äôt come home. She asked me if she could get her belongings today and leave. I‚Äôm heartbroken and want to fix things even though she‚Äôs treated me terribly. I still love her even though I shouldn‚Äôt. Last week she told me I meant the world to her and she would do anything to keep me in her life. Now she just wants to walk away. I feel like I‚Äôve been used, manipulated, and dashed across the rocks now that she‚Äôs done with me.

TL;DR: my girlfriend is abusive both physically and emotionally when she drinks. She attended two AA meetings recently, but became emotionally abusive while sober over the weekend. She left, didn‚Äôt come home, and wants to retrieve her belongings. I can‚Äôt cope with losing her even though she‚Äôs treated me terribly.

domesticviolence,"Everything is a struggle. I don't feel better after being away from him for over a week. My days consist of distracting myself, trying to not go back to him, giving all my love to my cat which is the only good thing, trying to get out of constant physical pain, doctors appts regarding physical abuse, being scared to leave the house because he lives so close. I feel like a coward for being scared to talk to police about him. I'm still going to try to. My neck still feels like it has his hand around it due to the pain. It's the most uncomfortable and painful feeling. I have been checked out by a doctor btw. I have constant nightmares and panic attacks. I don't feel like I've achieved anything by moving out a few weeks ago or more recently telling him to not contact me and by not crawling back to him when he asked me to go see him. I should not have gone back multiple times to begin with. I feel like he has no worries about anything right now, no remorse, and is probably drunk or high so he doesn't have to face himself. I feel like it's true when he would say constantly that no one loves me. Other than my house mates I talk to barely anyone and have no one except my cat. Abuser would tell me to make sure I remember that no one at all loves me after spitting on me. Hearing babies or children when I go out crushes me because of my miscarriage. I think the baby could've survived if I left him sooner. He told me he's glad about it, that I would've been a bad mother, that the baby means nothing to him because it's not born yet, and that only his first born child matters.

domesticviolence,"So I need some real advice and help. I came from an abusive ex husband. He got really physical with me a lot and would threaten to kill me and him, put out kids in harms way, He would take my keys so I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere, hold me down, sit on me and yell at me to my face, wouldn‚Äôt let me wear makeup or nice clothes (always looked like an old lady only), and I was NEVER allowed to hang out with friends or even go to the gym to workout (so I got super obese, gained 40lbs). Not only did I have an abusive ex-husband, but I was raped when I was 12.  It was bad.  Didn‚Äôt talk for a couple years. Those couple years of my life were literally blacked out and I have trouble remembering that time. My dad would tell me that I would break things and yell and shout and push people to get them away from me. I never had any formal counseling and am only now trying to get help after realizing I have trauma and ptsd that lashes out as anger ... and this is 22years of holding it in ... 

So back in October my boyfriend and I got into an argument one day about me not hearing something from him that I wanted to hear. He chose to walk away as he always does and start the shower. I got pissed he walked away from me so I went to the garage to get a hammer and then went to grab his phone to get his attention and started to yell at him to talk. I wanted nothing more than for him to listen and validate my fear and frustration however I took it out on him and started to threaten to hit his phone and him with the hammer. He then grabbed the hammer I was swinging towards him and was able to take it out of my hands but then I started to push him and shove him and slap him on his chest. All I could think of was how traumatic things were for me and that the only way for anyone to listen to me was to scream and hit. Anyway, he grabbed the hammer out my hands and grabbed my hands to stop me from hitting him and dragged me outside and told me to ‚Äúcool off before coming back inside‚Äù. Well just that TINY part of him dragging me out of the house was recorded on our home doorbell camera and was reported to the security alarm company and they submitted it to be reviewed by local law enforcement.  Well now they are charging him with assault 4 DV (misdemeanor). 

Another incident happened on Christmas Day where we were leaving a family members house and heading home when he wanted to go spend time with his dad. Internally I was furious because I never really had family to spend the holidays with and felt like I was being abandoned again. I got angry at him and yelled and wanted to spend the day we could together without any separation. Anyway, I got out of our vehicle and my moms Pyrex glass I had in my hand fell out of my shaky hands from me being upset and breaks all over the ground. I couldn‚Äôt believe it! It was given to my mom for her wedding and then she gave it to me and I was even more upset. My boyfriend came around the truck and started to tell me to calm down as I was trying to sweep the glass. I was so irrational in my thinking I swept the glass literally everywhere and yelled at him to again get away from me and tried to push him with the large broom. Well he tried to grab the broom out of my hands and threw it over the fence. I was pissed and that made me reflect back to not having any control with my ex and to be honest ... I pushed him again and screamed at him to get away. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone again. I felt like it was always a repeat thing in my life with people abandoning me and wanted validation and compassion from him. I tried to grab his keys out of the truck so he couldn‚Äôt leave and begged him to stay and talk to me. He told me he would then come back home from his dads after I calmed down and just wanted some 1:1 time with him.  So eventually he drove off after I yelled and called the police and told them I needed help. I told the police he ‚Äúpushed  me and threw my phone‚Äù. He never threw my phone though, I did out of anger when he threw the broom to get it out of my hands. 

Fast forward: Boyfriend now has TWO assault four charges that are considered both a misdemeanor. The first charge had an established ‚Äúno-contact order‚Äù which I asked to be dropped and dismissed.  Well we had to go to court last week due to the October and Christmas Day incident and they re-established a ‚Äúno-contact order‚Äù because the DA in the court room lied stating she saw me ‚Äúdragged out by my hair‚Äù from the October video. SAY WHAT?!?!!!! I was never dragged out by my hair and he never hurt me, I did the hurting!!!! 

Now we have the two assault charges and no contact order and I‚Äôm trying to tell the courts and his attorney and everyone he didn‚Äôt do anything that I lied and over exaggerated. I was in the wrong and am now seeking the counseling I need from not one, but two different specialist. 

He has a daughter that the ex has and during my anger on Christmas Day I called her to talk and met with her. I was wrong. I went to the ex thinking she would get back at him for whatever I was mad at and now she‚Äôs blown things way out of proportion and overly exaggerating. Well because of the police report I filed from Christmas (only that day) the ex is running with that and telling people everywhere that I‚Äôm in an abusive household and in danger and he hits me and holds me hostage. We‚Äôve never had that and I was the one that started the fight those two days. 

I‚Äôm not too sure how else to correct my mistakes and help and fix what I did. He never did anything and I feel so guilty and wrong for lying. I‚Äôve written statements to the attorneys and submitted a motion on rescinding the current no contact order. But I‚Äôm not too sure what else to do??? 

Anyone please help. And please don‚Äôt judge .... I‚Äôve had so much trauma and am trying to fix what I messed up.",Difficult situation (long),iAmNoOneReal,2020-02-17 06:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f54orw/difficult_situation_long/,2,1.0,2,3,1163
domesticviolence,"Hello, I have gotten away from someone who has:

Trapped me in his house and car (drive erratically and threaten to kill us both) and then would make phone calls to a person he was convincing I was abusing him, telling them I wouldn‚Äôt leave. Threatened to rape, kill me, kill my friends, family. Convinced couples therapists with real distress and tears, and triangulation, that I was the one abusing him. Hurt himself while attacking me and then told the same person above that I did it.  Gaslighted me for months, telling me I was Borderline and narcissist, that my actions traumatized him (leaving) so much that he had to hurt me. Threatened to kill himself over phone and when I called police, he convinced police i was abusing him. That I was overreacting by hiding in the bathroom after he tried to strangle me in his sleep, also saying it didn‚Äôt happen. Threatened to get a restraining order against me even though I was being stalked by him. Threatened to show up at my job, ruin my career, etc. 

I went back after all of this, and I wasn‚Äôt perfect either, definitely had a lot of trauma beforehand which helped create this dynamic. I feel guilt about this. I also was fearful and jealous initially, which he uses to demonstrate I was at fault.

He had me convinced, and therapists, and police, and self-destruction ( would say, I lost my job, how could I be the abuser? I have panic attacks and self harm, how could I be the abuser?) and used his ex who is dependent on him financially against me. Can anyone relate to doubting one‚Äôs self?

domesticviolence,"Hello, I'm feeling frustrated and I'm hoping someone can help or offer some advice.

My wife was married to a Marine for 9 years.    I met her 3 years ago near the base (I'm also active duty), our kids got along and I was a divorced dad so I wasnt turning down a play date.  Right off the bat I had a bad vibe about him and if he was home I made an excuse not to bring my kids over, he would tell stories that didn't make sense about getting loud and cops getting called but it sounded like fairly typical young Marine stuff.  As their relationship came apart I knew he was an asshole and dramatic but I didn't really know how far it went.

We lost touch because he hated me being her friend and I couldn't stomach how he talked to her, and the only reason we reconnected was him calling me and making crazy threats about having seen her.  I didn't take it too seriously because he doesn't have a very serious job as a Marine and I do, so I called and asked her to check her husband, she replied he wasn't her husband anymore.  I helped her out moving and fixing all the holes in the walls, and within a month of him deploying she'd left and bought her own house.  She was really adamant about refusing to take a dime from him, and our relationship happened pretty slowly the first year, seemed odd but I admired her independence.

We got married this summer, things were great, he was still himself but she didn't seemed phased by the screaming phone calls and crazyness, I told her to say it was harassment and that would shut him down.  Except it didn't, he waited until I was on a trip and he ramped it up pretty far, insults and harassment saying she's crazy and he'd take her daughter ect.  I contacted his unit and said he needed to back off.  That's when he took screen shots of my info and told my wife it was ""game on"".  She was terrified and I asked wtf was going on and he was all talk why so she scared and she blurted out that the reason the cops got called was he attacked her coming out of the shower her daughter came in with her MIL and saw the whole thing, and after he took her phone and keys she ran out barefoot and finished getting dressed out side before walking to the front gate of the base to report it.  That's the first time him telling those weird stories in front of her ALL the time made sense, he was humiliating her in front of anyone that stopped by.

He had bite marks to his hand and chest deep enough to scar, the cops on scene arrested him, gave her a citation she didn't have to appear for to cover their bases since he was bleeeing, and gave her a ride back home but didn't document any of her injuries.  His unit released him, put a restraining order and put him in counseling.  What they didn't do was give her any records of that, or charge him with any crime for choking her, and when they had a committee on it, they decided she was the aggressor for throwing a lotion bottle that didn't hit him so she could get to her pants.  She's 5'2"" 125lbs at most, he's 6'3"" 250+.   I had doubts about her story, how could he not get charged it sounds crazy, but the police report backs her story 100%, she won't even talk about anything she doesn't have proof because no one believes her already, and I've figured out there was a lot more.

Since I figured out their history, he has gone on to harass her every day since, harass me and her parents in another state, has started a custody dispute, records us at every interaction (legal in NC), the base refused to take the recent threats seriously, refused to charge or cite him for trying to slam her car door on her hands at the gate (because he refused to meet at the sheriff's office) ECT ECT

Has anyone ever gotten the DoD to take this seriously?  The sheriff wants a military protective order, the base cops recommend the sheriff, the lawyers say we need a report of a crime first, the domestic violence agency on base ignored her for a month and I had to initiate a case with them not doing their job to get them to do anything

My boyfriend thinks when he sees me on the couch that I‚Äôm being lazy and a ‚Äúloaf.‚Äù 

I was staying with him when I broke my leg until he made me go to my parents because he resented me and said it was my fault I broke my leg because I chose to ride horses. He came home black out drunk and shoved me while I was on crutches and forbidden to use my leg. He would yell and scream at me how much of a burden I was and I wasn‚Äôt there for him anymore. It made me feel like he didn‚Äôt want me when I needed him most. 

He has been getting black out drunk and screaming at me to get the fuck of his house.

I saw Mary getting uncomfortable and said maybe we shouldn‚Äôt talk about it over dinner and apparently because I disagreed with my bf (pushing to have Mary let George have a bachelor party) I had to shut up and keep my opinions to myself. 

He just told me tonight I need to move out because he‚Äôs not afraid of losing anything and I need to be taught a lesson. He thinks I take advantage of him and his home by being there and being on the couch after work. He says I am not social enough these last few months (with my broken leg) and he doesn‚Äôt care about me. He says I have taken over his home and have not been there for him.

It seems once we moved into a room he started saying he's happy that I'm leaving. That makes me think oh why didn't he want me that time compared to other times. I don't know why he escalated the abuse so much worse after we moved into a room together. He said that having a private room would mean less stress for him so he would be in a better mood. And the pregnancy stuff I can't get my head around. He pressured me to get pregnant. He was happy about it when I was. But after we moved into a room together he would tell me to abort it and that it wasn't his any time he was angry. Then after I miscarried he said he's glad and since then says he doesn't want anymore kids and that only his kid to another woman matters, that my unborn one didn't matter. He would go on and on about this other child and it would crush me because he hated my child for no reason. I don't know why he had to strangle me a week ago when he knows how much is terrifies me. He does this both when we're arguing and also during sex. I don't consent to that at all and he knows to not do it. I don't know why after I told him to not contact me he Litterely laughed and told me to drop things outside his house and said "" lol bye."" Why even do that when I wasn't speaking to him.

domesticviolence,"I feel like I‚Äôve made a terrible mistake.

After a lot of thought I decided to stay in the city I lived in where my abuser will likely reside after he is released from jail in 3 weeks. I decided to stay because I truly love this city, and I am incredibly happy and secure in my career here. This is home.

So I had this perfect plan to move out of my current apartment to a new place in a part of town that he would never guess I would be. The apartments last tenant left at the end of January, and they informed me it would be ready by the end of February. Well today they informed me it will not be ready and to check back in THIRTY DAYS to see if it is ready yet. I can‚Äôt get this lump out of my throat. They are not aware of my situation and it‚Äôs not their job to rush to accommodate me, but fuck this feels shitty.

As far as I understand, my abuser will be homeless upon his release. Unless he‚Äôs made some miracle happen for himself (which wouldn‚Äôt surprise me as he‚Äôs insanely manipulative and resourceful) he will likely bounce between family members of his child‚Äôs mother, friends, and stay in the streets. This is what he did for 2 months the last time he was released before I took him back and all the bullshit started again.

I don‚Äôt expect him to contact me right away, but I think he may try eventually. 30 days is too big of a window. There are no other suitable apartments in the market in this time.

domesticviolence,"There will be graphic details of my abuse in this post. Just FYI

My BF and I have been close friends for about 10 years. Mainly through social media because I moved. But we always had chats and confided in each other over the years. He's a recovering addict and I knew that going into a romantic relationship with him. What I didn't know was... all the toxic relationships he was in and his history with DV. A lot of his exes did DV right back to him and his last GF he actually got a felony charge for assault. When he explained it to me he explained that it was alcohol and meth induced and he's not like that sober. He's struggled with a lot of guilt about it over the past couple of years and I believed that that wasn't him. I ignored the red flag because I thought nothing like that could happen to me? Perhaps I was naive in love.

He has a lot of trust issues and anger issues. I brushed it off and tried being the perfect gf. There have been a few instances he got physical with me. It was always when alcohol was involved and has only gotten worse over time. I've been pulled by the hair, choked, held against my will, yelled at, called a stupid bitch, names, told I would be stuck at my parents forever... said he would kill myself, that I was emotionally abusing him by shutting down and not talking to him, told me that he hated me, I don't love him, and just all kinds of things.... I always forgave him because alcohol and because he would cry and show me he was truly remorseful for what he had done. We'd go through a couple of months of a seemingly perfect relationship...

A few days ago, I got the worst abuse I've ever had by him and anyone really. I've never been physically hurt by someone whose my romantic partner. Part of me is in denial and part of me feels like I deserved it?? I'm so fucked up over this that I find myself crying atleast a few times a day. Just thinking about what happened.. trying to figure out how did we get here. Our relationship was beautiful and hopeful in the beginning. I've never been so vulnerable and loved by someone before and yet abused at the same time??

So, a few days ago my ex husband and I are going through a divorce and though I did remind him the day of, I did leave out my ex was picking me up and dropping me off after we filed. Mainly to avoid conflict and so it'd be easier to not mention. He... found out. He was livid and said by not telling the truth I lied to him. He accused me of cheating with my ex despite us filing divorce... he left to his friends house. Came back a little drunk and my body just... it knew something bad was about to happen.

He yelled at me at what had happened, and when I tried to speak out he called me a liar and that I don't love him. He started slapping my body over and over. After awhile he bent my fingers back and demanded to see my texts with my ex. When I refused and said he should just trust me he got more angry and said it's because I was cheating. When I told him no he pulled my hair really hard. I tried to get up and leave and he pushed my body on the bed and craddled me and pushed me against the wall. He bent my fingers back again and bit my face and told him to show me. I told him to let my fingers go and I would. The pain hurt so bad I had no choice. The texts showed my ex and I planned this arrangement 3 days in advance. This angered him. We had small talk about a t.v show and possibly getting a beer after we filed for divorce. My bf started crying. Said he doesn't know how he can trust me after this. I can't remember what I said but he slapped my face pretty good. I just laid there, my whole body shaking... I told him to just kill me already if he was going to do it.

That's when he started crying realizing what he had done, I guess. We said we would try to move past it. I went to the bathroom and just cried. I had a huge knot on my head, and red marks. The next morning I didn't go to work because of bruises and a bite mark on my face and because I just couldn't bare going in anyways. This cost me my job. He told me he'd take care of me and pretty much just spent the whole morning apologizing to me. A part of me wants to hope and believe this won't happen again. If I just not talk to my ex anymore, he will be okay. He will trust me. Because when he trusts me and I don't do anything to anger him.. we are happy. We are fine. But another part of me knows this is wrong and my body can't ignore this like the past times.

As I said, I've been crying easily past few days. When he play fights with me like we used to do, it's triggering and my immediate response is to push his hands away. I feel dread and sadness. Uncomfortable. I feel myself spiraling into a depression because I think about all of our precious loving moments. Our good moments are more than our bad. I don't want to leave him. I'm almost in denial about the abuse. I don't know what to do... I'm just so sad. So so sad.  


Also, while being a recovering addict he also has personality disorders and other mental illnesses. He watched his dad growing up beat on women. So I know this is learned.. idk if he'll ever change.",I (27F) am experiencing DV from my bf (28M). I am heartbroken.. am I dumb for having hope?

domesticviolence,"I (M22) recently broke up with my girlfriend (F21). She was awful to me. Spat at me, scratched me, punched me, and a whole load of emotional abuse.

Two weeks ago, I told her enough is enough. On the Friday I met her in my home town to take her home. As we walked down the street, she became aggressive. I told her I was just going to stop at the local shop to get food and money for the car park. She continued walking as I went to the shop. Upon exiting, she told me I walked off (although it is obvious she did). She then started to push into me and knock the food out of my hand in which I was holding. On the drive to her place, she was having panic attacks and screaming not to leave her. When arriving at her place, I told her to forget about it and go to sleep. On the Saturday morning, she did the same thing. Angry and then begging for me never to leave her. I told I wouldn't.

That night I was out with friends. She texted me multiple angry texts like ""don't look at girls"", ""don't talk to any girls"", etc. I had enough and told her I was leaving. This time she was calm and thanked me for the memories.

On the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I told her I wanted to talk, but she refused to. She told me she was ""done"" and she was going to block me (she didn't). On the Friday I told her last chance to talk, and she said no again, so I told her that I would get my father to collect my stuff after advice from a female friend (whom she doesn't like). I then blocked her and she did the same to me on every platform. I haven't spoken to her in a week now.

I'm done with her, I really am. Every time we would break up I would run back like it was my fault and she would play on that.

The abuse wasn't my fault, but it feels like it is. Even though everyone has said to leave her and forget about her, I can't seem to not want her back. Why is this? And because of her obviously obsessive controlling behaviour is it likely she will contact again when she realises the control she is losing over me?

domesticviolence,"I (M22) split finally with an abusive girlfriend (F21). The relationship wasn't all bad, they never are. It was a three year relationship. My ex was bad to me. She spat in my face, scratched me, punched me, kicked my car, told me I could never do better because she was attractive, etc. 
For some reason I saw this as just a very normal relationship instead of realising that it was bad and walking away. The breakup happened roughly two weeks ago on the Saturday (01/02/2020). On the following Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I asked for her back, to make things work, I was begging. On the Friday, I had enough and told her I would be sending my father around to collect my stuff. I blocked her Whatsapp and she did the same (and blocked me on everything else).
My problem is this. I know she is no good for me, and the abuse is unacceptable. But why do I still wish for her back? She doesn't deserve me at all. The Satueday night I broke up with her, the morning she was begging and worrying I would. Then she just accepted it? What's is she going to do next?

Then blocked me I think. Why does he do that? I was not even speaking to him other than to tell him once to not contact me. He just didn't care about the ongoing physical abuse he's done to me. It reinforces me feeling worthless. I wanted to see him so much today but I didn't because if I go see him he will twist it and act like he's dumping me. Then watch me have a breakdown then reel me back in a few days. This is because I didn't want to be abused and didn't want contact while resting trying to get better. That makes him angry and want to make me feel worthless. I'm in pain from being strangled and I want his comfort. It's so wrong because I know he won't comfort me or acknowledge it. He used to comfort me afterwards and but he hasn't since I've moved out and when I got closer to moving out.

domesticviolence,"I(25F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) since June 2019. It has been intensely abusive from the second week, even have got my ribs broke, and (MJ) pipe broke my my face. I have left about 5 times. And come right back after being away doing so well. Well one of the ""episodes"" recently got his butt thrown in jail. My work called, and state took it into their hands. Well I ended up leave about a month the ago, and stayed gone for a couple weeks. Well now I'm back and he has got me on iv meth. So yeah I get my brain has been cloudy. But he indirectly made me recant my statement and say I did it all myself because I'm a psychopath who needs rehab and counseling. Which yes I agree I do but it sucks to feel like I am actually wrong like I am honestly thinking it's literally my fault he's in all this trouble (he's spent 9 yrs of his life in prison so freedom is everything to him) so I've bee going alone g with it. I might add I have the most wonderful family who I have chose to push out because it isn't fair to them to watch me constantly chose him. They beg for me to come home (I own my own trailer) but I ignore every twxt, partially because he, again, indirectly made me delete everything SM, and block my family 100% out. I love him and I feel so terrible, but he LITERALLY talks about the situation like I actually did all this to myself and I'm literally crazy because ""I have a horrible memory and he remembers EverYThIng""   so I went in and talked to the prosecutor again to comply with the ""real story"" for our court date the 18th this month. I feel so stuck. I feel like I literally CAN'T tell the truth. Because it will hurt him so bad, and I don't want to go back home. Nobody understands me. My anxiety (never EVER suffered from ANY form of mental health issues before him, nor drugs, AT ALL) is through the roof. I don't know what the hell to do. I know he's about to try and come down from the meth and it's going to be frightening. But I want to be here for him ""because he has never given up on me and TOOK BACK AFTER IVE LEFT HIM"" and he deserves to have someone who cares...that's literally how I'm thinking. But I'm disgusted by thinking that. And I know the drug does NOT help, but I've ALWAYS had these types of emotions about the incident. 
I literally feel stuck. Like I have nobody nothing. I haven't been outside (literally not even a foot on the porch) in a weeeeek because he's scared the police will see me and he will get revoked on bond. So he makes me hide in the dryer before and after leaving. And I have to whisper at ALL times in the house (we have downstairs neighbors). Y'all please help me. Am I literally just pathetic and selfish or is how I'm feeling really a thing? Like I feel like the bad guy in every scenario. Why can't people understand NO HE ISNT FORCING ME TO STAY AGAINST MY WILL BY TYING ME DOWN AND HOLDING A GUN TO MY HEAD, but I feel in some way forced and obligated to be here and not leave to go to my parents. And what should I do about court üò≠ because now his sister and him have been recording conversations between him and I and in one I said I wanted to kill myself and she said she can edit it to where you couldn't hear him screaming at me. And his sister is a real con artist, so I'm scared they're going to get me in trouble if I leave him. I'm lost. I'm sick, and now I'm on a drug (that he holds over my head to, because I didn't stop now he is a junkie) like I honestly believe him but also at the same time know that he's being narcissistic, and manipulative. Again please don't suggest get treatment it's the drugs that's messing you up. Yes you are correct. But I felt this way from the beginning (no drugs). And I have an assessment with a rehab this week. 

He wants to move to TX soon, and take me with him. Why can't I let him get what u Know he deserves. Why can't I leave and scream for help(because I don't feel like he's harming me right now, and I feel I would be over exaggerating if I say I'm being abused and scared) .

My step niece recently overdosed on heroin and it had my head in a bad place, so I was crying. He slapped me in the face which made me cry more and caused my sister-in-law to come see what was going on. He told her he hadn't touched me and I was being crazy, which, I'll admit, made me act a little crazy (but not aggressive, more like sobbing) especially when she said that he was fine and I was basically a bad parent and bad human in general, and that even if he had hit me, I deserved it.

Once she was done yelling at me for ""crying in her house"" and calling me rude, I tried to get up to call my parents or my niece to come get me. They took my phone. He told me he had broken it (he hadn't). Lots of arguing ensued and the next thing I knew I was being dropped to the floor by my neck. he'd stop choking me and let me up just to drop me again. I think it happened three times. I can't really remember except for trying to get him off me and not being able to breathe. He also punched me/slapped me in the face repeatedly and slammed my head off the floor. When I finally got away I gave up any hope of my parents or the police helping me and went to sleep. I woke up with finger prints on my neck (one that has bruised), two black eyes, and countless bruises on my arms/elbows/torso and three lumps on my head. When I said something in the morning he didn't apologize, he said whatever, I had just fallen down. No apology. No remorse. And now he acts like nothing even happened minus doing all the errands because...obviously he doesn't want me outside with black eyes.

I guess my question is...since this happened in a different county than the one I reside in, is that where I would need to go to report it? Or would my local county allow me to report it here? I can't do this anymore. I have four boys. I don't want them growing up thinking this behavior is okay. And I definitely dont want my daughter thinking it's okay.

Another thing is when I mentioned calling 911, my in-laws said they'd tell the police I just fell out of my chair. I don't want to risk losing my kids to him.

domesticviolence,"(TW: sexual abuse, physical violence, suicidal ideation) Hey all. This is my first time posting here, but I'd love to get perspectives from both survivors of sexual violence and romantic partners of survivors. Thank you in advance if you read the whole spiel. I really didn't mean to write out my whole fucking story, but I haven't shared it in a long time. üòÖ

I'm (24f) currently living on my own. I have been in a wonderfully healthy, communicative, and committed relationship for the past 2 years with a lovely partner, but I have a lot of wounds that I'm still trying to heal from my past.

On a rational level, I do not like to compare trauma, or believe that one's feelings are less valid because what happened to them was ""not as bad"" as the next person over. However, on an emotional level, I still struggle with seeing what happened to me as something that was completely undeserved, and I struggle to validate my pain.

I was coerced into having sex for the first time at the age of 16 by an older schoolmate, and I subsequently had many issues relating to PTSD and attachment issues that affected my future relationships. One high school relationship that continued through my first year of college was with a guy who I truly believe had some issues of his own‚Äî I used to dissociate at times during sex while experiencing flashbacks and become physically unresponsive. He would continue having sex with me during those moments, telling me I needed to ""learn how to say no"" because another guy could take advantage of me when he wasn't around and wouldn't ""understand"" my issues. Sometimes, I became incredibly distressed or suicidal when re-experiencing my trauma and I would inevitably claw at myself. He used to try to stop me, but then eventually he scratched me to try to get me to ""snap out of"" my flashbacks or suicidal spells, and eventually, tried choking me as a means of ""grounding"" me or ""scaring"" me out of wanting to die. Pain during sex triggered me, and I tried to do exposure sessions in which he'd pinch me and inflict minor pain in order to desensitise me to pain, which he deemed was ""normal."" Even now, I believe he genuinely thought he was helping me, I really think he was that sick.

And so was I. I feel incredibly ashamed of bringing up these incidents, especially the choking, because I didn't try to stop him at first. I was so depressed and desperate, I went along with anything. Eventually, when I got to college away from him, I did tell him that choking me didn't help, and that I thought we should stop. He agreed. But, it was only a month or two later when one night, I woke up, panicking, (I realize now) craving comfort, and begging him to let me die. He woke up to this, and started choking me again. I was caught off-guard. I... I'm sure many of you know the feeling, but the world became strangely silent, and I started seeing stars (or sparkles). I think i was about to black out, but suddenly, he stopped.

At the time, I'll admit that I had started cheating on him with a college friend of mine. After that incident, I told the friend and he simply said, ""You could have died."" Somehow, that brought me to reality, and I knew I had to let him go. I returned home at the end of my freshman year and tried to break up with him. He ended up coercing me into having sex one last time with him. It felt like rape to me; he physically stopped me from going up the stairs after I told him to leave with a subtle touch from his hands, and by that point, I didn't feel like I had a choice. I think I was just so brainwashed and conditioned. But I still blame myself for not being aggressive. (Then again, I shouldn't have to punch or yell at someone to get them to respect me?)

Anyway, this was all to say that while I had another boyfriend after him, then many dates, and finally my current partner, I have realized that I am fine in relationships until they get serious. I have no intention of leaving my partner, but the thought of sexual intimacy now terrifies me, and even making out sets me off. I know that healing can be a lifelong process, but I can't help but feel like I'm doing it ""wrong"" and that it shouldn't take me so much time to ""get over"" it. I don't feel like what happened to me merits my current issues with PTSD and intimacy, and I just feel an incredible amount of shame and guilt. I've been seeing a therapist for years that I click with, yet I still feel so broken. My partner is incredibly patient and supportive, yet I can't get myself to fully trust him with my body. I'd love to hear from other survivors on if any of you experience similar things where hookups aren't a problem, but committed relationships are, and I'd also love to hear from any partners of survivors on how they support their partners and practice self care in situations like these.

domesticviolence,"Hi. I need to vent. As I wrote on my last posts I moved out of abusers place recently. Today I went to the store and didn't have enough for food only the cats food which I buy before my own. I'm still in pain from being choked recently. I went no contact soon after that. I have done the right thing by staying away. I haven't seen him since the morning after that. So about a week ago. I got these texts from abuser over the last few days, including a bunch of missed calls. Him: "" I will still help you with food"". Him: ""do you need food or not."" Him: ""come over if you want."" Him: "" come over if you want food. I need you for something."" Me: ""You need to stop contacting me."" Him: ""I'm going to need my extension cord and my dust pan back. Drop it off outside my house. Lol bye."" I only read the last message today as I was going to take up his offer on food.  He knows I use the extension cord for all the power in my room.  All of this because I distanced myself after being CHOKED. No apology. No checking up if I'm actually ok in that regard. Just using the fact that i'm struggling financially with food, etc to try to lure me back into his house. Then being cruel when I don't want contact. I was hysterical this afternoon after not being able to buy food then reading the last cruel text. I'm embarrassed that people saw me so upset crying. He sent that as I hadn't caved in as quick as he wanted me to. He would always do this with household items if I'd talk back or stand up to him. He'd say ""well if you're going to act like that you can't use these things anymore."" I feel so horrible.  I spoke to a dv counsellor and I'm going to go through with trying to get an order on him as we live on the same street.

example; he will yell at me, push me, verbally abuse me. if I yell back he says that ""it's a trigger"" and that's what makes him hit me. and that if I pull his hair or push him off or scream it ""makes him want to hurt me more"" and the reason he keeps on is because ""you did it first"" and I ""shouldnt have yelled"" ESPECIALLY if I cry. if I cry during physical abuse he will bump it up 100x. 

basically he wants me to sit there and let him abuse me and wants me to just not scream? how do you not scream when someone is hitting you? how do you not cry? 

if I'm not smiling happy and praising him, I'm ""triggering"" him. 

tonight we argued just like my example, and I asked to sleep alone. as soon as I fell asleep he woke me up, to ""apologoze"" but the second he woke me up I started having a anxiety attack and my vision was spinning. but I know if I ask him to leave me alone it'll start more so I just accepted the apology quickly and he left while I dealt with the attack. I just can't fall back asleep without venting a little. 

I know the simple answer is leave. 
but obviously it's more complex than that. 
I want to. but right now I'm just venting. 
it feels like it's worth it to suppress my feelings around him right now to avoid a fight. and if I can't be visibly upset around him this thread always helps me.",when your abuser uses you defending yourself as reason to continue what do you do?,lydmannn,2020-02-11 04:11:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f22vzf/when_your_abuser_uses_you_defending_yourself_as/,19,0.92,11,15,265

domesticviolence,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text, I'm just still going through a lot, and figuring things out.

Looking back, there were a lot of red flags. A lot of his behavior was explained by his past, and for a while he was really trying to work on his issues. But now that I look back, even though he never learned differently, it was still mental abuse.

I eventually decided I deserved better. I was tired of getting criticized for everything; him doing literally nothing, no job, no house work, no cooking then complaining about lack thereof; getting into insane arguments because he assumed things, or just pain gaslighted me; and his controlling behaviors. I left him and started looking for a new place. At that point, he had never laid a hand on me, he had punched walls, and threw stuff around, but that was it. 

The following days were a cycle of him telling me how much he loved me, and promises of change. When I once again reestablished boundaries, he would get angry, insult me, throw my stuff, even spit on me. Following by him feeling guilty, apologizing and the cycle would start again. At that point, I was so over everything, most of his behaviors were easy to ignore (some were even laughable), I just wanted it to be done.

A few days later, during the weekend, he started getting more agitated. Everything cumulated when he stole my phone from me because he thought I was calling the police. Well after that I did call them, as he was getting unpredictable, and I wanted to be safe. As I was on the phone, we walked in and started hitting and choking me. It was a lot of back and forth after that, including him threatening to kill himself, and then breaking down the door to the bathroom when I managed to go hide. The police eventually got here, and I had managed to hold down the bathroom door.

I'm doing better now, I moved, he has a restraining order, and honestly I'm not scared that he'll come after me. But it was really fucking terrifying. And most of all, it took me by absolute surprise. If you would've asked me just the day before, I would've sworn up and down that he would never hurt me. But it happened. And it can happen to others.

Like I said, looking back there were a lot of signs. He was effectively isolating me, he was manipulative, and he didn't really try to change. I honestly hope that this is a lesson for him, and he really does try to get help.

I just don't want this to happen to anyone else. So if you've made it this far, thank you. If anything I said resonated with you, and your relationship, take a step back and evaluate what you want in a relationship, and if your relationship is healthy.

They may not be ready to leave yet, it's hard as fuck to decide to leave someone you love or care for, but if they know you are there when they need you, it'll make the process easier.

As background, my job is as a server in a high end steakhouse. I used to work there about four years ago, but I only returned in November. I have been making an effort to keep to myself as much as possible, most of the people I work are young and entitled assholes who lack any compassion and do a lot of drinking, drugs, and gambling.

A couple of weeks ago she posted on Facebook about how her xBF ""bought"" her a vacation to Punta Cana, so I asked her about it when I saw her next. She at first said that they weren't back together, but going on vacation together, then almost immediately said that she was lying &amp; hadn't wanted to ""admit defeat"" because they were back together. That he had used her money to book this vacation without consulting her &amp; then presented it as a gift. I didn't say anything at the time because others were around &amp; she began speaking to someone else. 

Yesterday I went into work &amp; someone asked me what happened with her, that she has left crying. I hadn't seen her so I asked someone who was working with her &amp; they said, with an eyeroll, that she ""got beat up"" the night before by her BF, so she had to go. 

My question is two fold, how do I offer her help? I don't know if she sees this as DV, or how seriously unacceptable it is to be abused by a partner, or if this is a lifelong cycle she deems normal. She does not seems happy. I'm a very awkward person, I'm not good at making friends and really try not to engage with my co-workers on a deeper level than work. This is very uncomfortable for me but I recognize that I really should say something.

domesticviolence,"Long post ahead. Mentions of sexual situations and domestic violence. Please excuse the jumbled writing as 
A) I am on mobile, and 
B) I'm writing this drunk and through tears.

Ok, so to start off, when I say I think he hates me... I really do. Not an exaggeration. 
He never, ever kisses me. He doesn't hug me. He barely even looks up from his video games.
Any time I talk to him I'm always wrong about something. Ex:
Me: that was a nice movie.

Him: of course you'd think that, but what should I expect from someone so simple?

Shit like that . And whenever we argue even a little he will gaslight me. Saying what initially happened to make me upset was all in my head, or because I'm Autistic I just wanted to start a fuss. 
Saying that because my father was abusive and my mother was addicted to opioids for a few years that I'm a ""bad seed"".. me and my mother have a very healthy relationship and I haven't spoken to my father in over ten years.  (even though he was the same... For longer, and his family never got help....)


He makes me feel like I'm at fault for the house being a mess even when I have been gone all day.  He never asks about my day.
All he does all day is play  Red Dead Redemption 2 or Ghost Recon Breakpoint, or eat food. When he's upset with the games, especially online modes, he will scream at the top of his lungs, break things and yell at me to pick them up or clean it immediately,  and get mad when I flinch, then yell at me. He hasn't hesitated raising his fist. He's paralyzed half of my face before. (If you want to know, the long story short is he gave me bells palsey because he hit me in the face for not getting him enough birthday gifts, a few days later I woke to a pain in my face and half of it wouldn't move. He laughed at me.) He gets mad that I can't buy him a new 4k tv, new video games, new controllers, PC... Even though I'm going through school right now!!! I barely have enough to feed myself. As if I'm even obligated to get him a damn entertainment system!! He doesn't have a job nor is he on disability. 

I have a problem with my nose, I get nose bleeds but  I cough up the blood quite often due to it dripping down my throat. When this happens he accuses me of using blood capsules to get attention. He took pictures and put it on Snapchat one time saying, "" oh look, *myname* is pulling her silly little pranks again!""

I had a seizure and he didn't bat an eye. 



He has never taken me on a real date in the 3 years we've been together.

He talks to anybody and everyone he can about how inattentive I am.

He uses my secrets against me. My childhood abuse? He said I must have liked it and I'm at fault for it happening to me for not immediately reporting. My history with drug abuse? He holds that over my head at every chance. 


Every time we try to get intimate anymore he just pretty much, to save being graphic, gets it over with for himself and doesn't pay any mind to me. Not to mention half the time it ends up in a fight because I won't give him a play- by - play on what to do to me. I don't enjoy it anymore and I'm barely even attracted to him.

He's every horrible thing a man can be so why does it pain me to want to leave him? Why? Oh my God why?",My boyfriend hates me. I really think he does.,cruoreye,2020-02-10 01:40:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f1ixz3/my_boyfriend_hates_me_i_really_think_he_does/,5,0.81,3,9,633

I‚Äôm almost 40 and live in a world I feel is completely unsafe and filled with doom. I‚Äôve only found the hormonal response to intense romantic passion to balance me and make me feel safe.

Other times I date people with whom passion doesn‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs completely safe but that safety fades and I feel I‚Äôm a prisoner in a passionless and sexless relationship.

domesticviolence,"About a year ago my nex snapped the neck of my guitar. He hid it under the bed and when i asked where it was he was so apologetic, he didn't know it was so important. I should have known he'd go after my guitar, in the past I had stopped playing because anytime I'd pick it up he'd need my 100% attention immediately. Which he never needed my attention unless I was reading or playing guitar, my only hobbies. But he apologised profusely, until he had to see how geninuely hurt I was. A couple hours after I had learned I was still hurt still a bit teary eyed and quiet, yet he was no longer apologetic. He telling me to get over it and that my bad mood was upsetting him. I needed to just get over it already and that I was being dramatic. 3 days later we were arguing and he looked at my other guitar and said ""Don't make me break that one too."" So I smashed it, so he couldn't gaslight me. I knew he'd back pedal out of it, deny saying something so incriminating. I regret it so much, I behaved like something I'm not. He proved that wasn't sorry he broke one, he used it as leverage. Well today I finally got a new guitar. I adore it and I finally have my self expression back. Nobody can hold it against me.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôm in a situation where I recently left my infant son‚Äôs father after 7 years of emotional abuse. He still comes into mine (and my mother‚Äôs) home two days a week because he does not live in a place that‚Äôs suitable for our son to stay. I‚Äôm working two days a week and living with her until I can get on my feet. 

He does not respect my boundaries (just wanting to be left alone) and I will likely end up avoiding the home altogether beyond work. He doesn‚Äôt bother my mom and she avoids him. When he tries to converse with me or I overhear stuff he says, it‚Äôs often angry and impatient in tone. 

The most alarming thing to me is how he has started to mention ways he‚Äôd kill our cats when they misbehave. It‚Äôs now beyond a simple ‚Äúugh I could just kill them‚Äù and has only been a thing for a month or two? He told one of them he‚Äôd hang them by their feet in the garage, punt them down the hall, etc. 

He‚Äôs never been violent with me, but he hit his mother as a teenager and is often violent with himself. He has borderline personality disorder and bipolar, and has attempted suicide twice.

The other night he got violent during sex, strangled me to the point I started having a panic attacks and did things I didn't consent to. I left in the middle of it and went home. He texted me within the days after asking what's going on, then saying it's best if we're friends. then the morning after that saying that he doesn't want me, etc. I haven't had contact with him since that morning. I have litterely been focused on moving on. Days later his texts have started up again asking if I need help with buying groceries and demanding an answer basically. I can tell he's going to get real nasty soon. He used to threaten to have me put In a mental hospital. I'm worried about him starting those threats again or doing something. I'm too scared to get an order on him as he says I'll just look like the crazy one and that they will not believe me. He has videos of me where I probably do look crazy as he would deprive me of sleep all night and just film me and film my reaction to verbal or physical abuse. Or not let me hide in the closet from him. There is one where I fought back too. He originally took these so that my baby would be taken from me apparently. But that never happened as I miscarried. I can't block his number as my phone won't let me so I need to buy a new SIM or contact the phone company. He will NOT just STOP. I have not spoken to him at all for days.

domesticviolence,"Hey guys, just a h/u, I‚Äôm on mobile, so I apologize for the formatting. Also TW for sexual assault. This just happened last night and I‚Äôm still pretty fucked up about it, so I‚Äôm sorry if my thoughts are a bit scrambled.

Here‚Äôs some background; I‚Äôm an EMT on a private ambulance. Last year, I dated a security guard from a local hospital for a month. He was sexually abusive and scarred me emotionally. The first night I met him, he told me he loved me. I was so eager to be loved that I fell hook, line and sinker into the trap. I‚Äôm not going to get into the nitty gritty details about what happened, but I will say there were some times he hurt me so bad when we were in bed together that I legitimately thought I should go to the ER, but I never did. I chose to stay with him because I so badly wanted to be loved, or at least to hear someone say I love you to me. At the end of the relationship, we had a fight and he broke up with me.

A few months ago, I was in an outpatient hospitalization program for PTSD and an eating disorder. I wasn‚Äôt doing well, I had nightmares, panic attacks, and I just in general didn‚Äôt feel safe. Through my time in program, I was able to gather enough strength to go to the police and report what happened. I now have a detective assigned to my case who has been extremely helpful. My detective said the ex has done some of the same things he did to me before to other girls who also reported it. Although I don‚Äôt have a lot of cold, hard proof, the fact that this has happened before could strengthen my case.

Last night, I was on shift. We were assigned a lift assist call at a hospital I used to work at. I was pretty excited to go to that hospital, because it usually means I get to see one of my best friends who works security there. We pull around in front of the ER and I see my best friend and a couple other security guards (more like I saw a couple guys in security vests, couldn‚Äôt make out faces or anything). So, I make a mad dash to my best friend to give him a huge hug, like we usually do. I make it to the door and see my ex in the huddle. My heart stopped and my brain raced. My best friend came to me and walked me outside where I just completely lost it. For a few minutes, all I could say was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs him.‚Äù My best friend knew of the situation and who my ex was. He hugged me and said ‚ÄúI know, I know.‚Äù We walked to my ambulance and kind of stood in silence for a bit while I sobbed and he hugged me. 

After quite a bit of this, I got back in my ambulance and we went to go find our other crew. My partner, having seen everything that went down, asked what happened and I explained. He told me to stay in the ambulance while he helped the other crew with the patient. While he was helping, I sat in the ambulance sobbing and panicking. My partner was a great support, although he wasn‚Äôt supposed to, he drove us to the destination where we helped the other crew and drove us back to the garage.

I finally got home, took my anxiety meds and knocked out. Waking up this morning was tough. I want so badly to believe it was just a nightmare, that it didn‚Äôt happen in reality. I don‚Äôt want to believe that he works at that hospital or that I‚Äôll ever see him again there. It‚Äôs really messing me up because that hospital was my safe haven. I have my best friend there and I know it like the back of my hand. It‚Äôs one thing when I know I‚Äôm going somewhere I know he works and can prepare myself, but I was completely blindsided by this. To make things worse, my boyfriend lives a couple blocks away from the hospital he works at now and I feel so sick knowing whenever I go to his house, my ex may well be a few blocks away.

I thought I was getting better. My panic attacks started to diminish and I haven‚Äôt had a horrible one for months. I haven‚Äôt had nightmares for a while. I feel like all my progress went down the drain. I am so mad at myself for letting him still control me, I don‚Äôt know why he has such a big impact on me, nearly a year after the relationship.

domesticviolence,"Hi all,   


I almost can't believe I'm writing this. I left my abuser on June 6th, 2019 - so today is my 8 month anniversary. I can't wait to celebrate at one year :)  


About a year ago, it was my 25th and spending the weekend with all my friends at a beach house. I was excited to bring my boyfriend to meet all my friends. He (he always had health problems - now I really question how legitimate they are) get very, very sick, and insisted I take him (alone) to the ER. I didn't have my car, and I wanted one of my friends to drive us there. he insisted I go there alone with him. I spent my birthday alone with him, in the ER, somewhere in New York, missing my friends (who flew in from around the US/the world to get together). 

He wouldn't let me dance anymore, kept me apart from my friends as much as possible, and constantly said negative things about my family that I started believing. In the morning, I couldn't go to the bathroom, even though I'd always wake up before him. I had to stay in bed and just hold it. His diets were always extreme (like he was either living purely on junk food, or eating super healthy with no bread/coffee/potatoes/etc.) Whatever diet he was on, I had to go along with it - my weight totally yoyo'd all year.   


We fought constantly about laundry. I enjoyed doing laundry at my parents house - it's free, they live around the corner, and it's a good excuse to spend time with them. He wanted us to go to a laundromat. I later realized this was only to keep me from seeing my parents.   


He manipulated me into buying a house. He'd frequently ""confiscate"" my phone and my car keys if I wasn't paying enough attention to him. I'd have to negotiate for how long I was allowed to leave the house for. To this day - what I love the most is being able to stay out as late as I want! 

  
He forced me to take sleeping pills I didn't need, and now I'm dependent on them. I lost 10s of thousands of dollars by buying a house with him. He convinced me I had severe mental illness and got me to see a psychiatrist. I started taking ADHD meds I didn't need. (I do not have mental illness and never have). 

&amp;#x200B;

He gaslit me HARD. I never knew what was real and what wasn't. The first time he choked me and slammed me into the wall in the living room, I wasn't sure what had happened. I asked him about it later, and he said that it never happened, that I imagined it. It wasn't until I left him and started getting therapy that I realized - it did happen, and it was real. I can still feel his thumbs pressed against the front of my neck. 

&amp;#x200B;

He forced us to be homeless for 7 months. Do you know how hard it was to get ready for work in the morning? He airbnbd our apartment, and later our house, and kept all the money, and in the meantime, forced me to live in terrible conditions. 

He actually broke up with me. He wanted me to give him $17,000, and told me he'd break up with me if I refused. So- I refused. I didn't have the money anyway. Later, he told me he'd ""forgive me"" and we could stay together. I am SO glad I had friends who helped me see the truth - because I almost went back.   


I wish I had known that couples counseling is not helpful, and it's counterproductive. We saw a couples therapist, and I definitely stayed with him for about 6 months longer because the therapist always agreed with him, on every point. She always sided with him (he was very manipulative). Couples counseling is actually NOT recommended in cases of DV and it can make things worse:  [https://www.thehotline.org/2014/08/01/why-we-dont-recommend-couples-counseling-for-abusive-relationships/](https://www.thehotline.org/2014/08/01/why-we-dont-recommend-couples-counseling-for-abusive-relationships/)   


In November I made an appointment with this therapist and just yelled at her for like 20 minutes. I gave her articles and a book to read. I described all the ways in which her lack of professionalism hurt me. It was great - she listened, and I really think she took it to heart.   


Here's another great article on gaslighting: [https://www.thehotline.org/2014/05/29/what-is-gaslighting/](https://www.thehotline.org/2014/05/29/what-is-gaslighting/)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not truly ""out of the woods"" until I finish my taxes for this year. I hope I can get that wrapped up soon. For anyone who is going through something similar (or if you think you might be) get HELP. Get perspective. Spend some time alone in the woods (seriously, that's what helped me).   


But most of all, get out. Life with an abuser will always feel like struggling to stay afloat. It took me about a month to truly believe I was being abused (and that was with literally dozens of people shouting it at me!)   


Life has gotten so much better. I'm still dealing with a lot of financial shit and I'm terrified of men (and was raped while I was sleeping, very shortly after breaking up with him, by someone else) but things are so so much better when you escape your abuser.

domesticviolence,"[UPDATE] HE LEFT REHAB AFTER ONLY ONE DAY!!!!

I have posted on here before about my abuser and his drug addiction and how it has affected my daughter and I. She was removed from his apartment during a drug bust when she was there for a visit, and wasn‚Äôt sent back home to me because I became homeless because of his previous abuse. He held my daughter and I hostage and beat me unconscious and left lasting physical and mental damage. I have to wear glasses because he damaged my eye so badly. He never should have had visitation with her. All of this led to both of us being put in Family Court and my daughter is with my mom until I secure housing. Well he was doing well in Family Court for a little while and he was allowed visitation again. My mom was supervising the visits and told me that she suspected he was using again but didn‚Äôt tell the court because his parents are paying her for taking care of my daughter. When I saw him nodding out in the courtroom, I knew he had relapsed. I told everyone I could and everyone said that I was lying. I have been beyond frustrated with the system. His caseworker is his old boss that used to cover for him when he got high at work. He eventually got fired and so did she. I repeatedly complained that this was a conflict of interest and nobody agreed. I was getting sick of nobody believing that he was using again because I had no evidence.

Finally the court believes me because when my mom took my daughter to visit him this weekend he was visibly high. He acts crazy and makes weird noises when he is using because he has mental difficulties to begin with. My daughter saw him like that and told me that she was sad that she couldn‚Äôt see her Dad because ‚ÄúHe was acting crazy on drugs again.‚Äù This broke my heart. He admitted to my mom that he was on heroin and was going into rehab. He is there now and he is still ahead of me in the Family Court process because I just recently moved into the county. Because he admitted that he relapsed I am afraid that the court is going to continue to take his side. I am glad he is in rehab, but this just proves that he can only stay clean for a short while before he goes back to drugs. He has been using since he was 18 and this is his 10th time in rehab. I have never used drugs, never been arrested, and never hurt my children in any way. I want to be relieved that the court found out he was using, but where I live, drug users have a lot of rights. There is even a medically assisted injection site here! I raised my little girl for 5 years and I can‚Äôt believe this is even happening. They don‚Äôt even take into account the years of documented abuse against us!

domesticviolence,"Lately I‚Äôve [25F] been going through lot of emotions regarding my mother [39F], my sister [16F] and my upbringing. Growing up my mother has been in multiple abusive relationships. 3 of them that were really long and horrible. I have seen my mother get dragged, punched, spit on, sexually exploited around her boyfriends friends, and embarrassed at home and in public. 

As a kid I would have serious break downs and be so embarrassed from seeing my mom get hit in public &amp; at home. Emotionally, I was drained. I would be scared to come home after school because I feared that I would see my mother dead, getting hit, or arguing. Her boyfriends were never too fond of me and one of them, the one who she was in a relationship with the longest, would also hit me and make advances toward me. I ended up running away from home at 17 and I have been on my own since then but I still kept in contact with my mom and my sister. I have strong feelings of hate sometimes for my mom. I love her but I hate that she didn‚Äôt stick up for herself or at least for her kids and I hate that she allowed us to see such bad things our WHOLE life. I can‚Äôt trust men at all for the things that I‚Äôve seen. I feel that my view of the world and relationships is ruined because of her. My mom was attracted to bad guys and abusers. She moved very quickly with men &amp; we were stuck having to see different men abuse her and us. 

 My little sister has also been a victim of seeing the abuse. She‚Äôs young and doesn‚Äôt know how to react to the things my mom has allowed to happen so she has began acting out. She‚Äôll leave the house for weeks, the longest time was 2 months, just to make my mother worry about her and to hurt her. She has become very promiscuous and openly involved with older men. I am not judging my sister at all for what she does with her body but it hurts because I know she‚Äôs doing it in retaliation to what she feels inside. She‚Äôs seeking love and attention from men who are using her. I wish I could stop it but i don‚Äôt want her to feel like I‚Äôm policing her body and then she cuts off communication with me. She‚Äôs still a kid and needs guidance but she doesn‚Äôt want people to tell her what to do. She tells me everything and though I really hate what she‚Äôs doing, I need her to keep telling me what she‚Äôs doing and know that I‚Äôm here for her. 

I am scared for her and for what she will end up doing. Every time my mom tries to do mother daughter activity with her or talk to her she blatantly disrespects her and it boils my blood. I know I have harsh feelings buried deep for my mom but I still don‚Äôt disrespect her because she‚Äôs experienced that enough in her life. There has been 3 occasions where I have almost really put my hands on my sister for disrespecting my mom the way that she does. Those incidents made me realize I needed to go to therapy because I didn‚Äôt want to be a person who used violence to express anger. So I‚Äôve just started therapy a week ago. 

My mom has not been in a relationship for  4 years and is celibate now. She‚Äôs been trying her best to find herself and create a better relationship with us and I appreciate that. She had me really young and didn‚Äôt have any guidance and protection so I somewhat understand why she couldn‚Äôt provide that for us but it still hurts a lot. 

I feel like our anger is misplaced because we know our mom was the victim but to what extent ? Why didn‚Äôt she ever even try to leave these guys or stand up for us? Why were their needs before ours? She has emotional issues from her past and I understand that, which is why I have more sympathy in my heart than my sister does. It took me to grow up and have a baby to understand that before my mom is my mother, she‚Äôs her own woman and she is human and she‚Äôs gonna make mistakes. I just would really like advice on everything. Forgiving my mother. Helping my sister with her wild behavior and trying to help her forgive my mom. I feel like I‚Äôm carrying the weight of the entire family on my shoulders.",Resentment towards my [25F] mother [39F],biancaserenity,2020-02-07 00:36:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/f0281p/resentment_towards_my_25f_mother_39f/,2,0.86,5,6,782
domesticviolence,"I‚Äôve searched through other posts like this but could use some advice specific to this situation... My wife and I got new neighbors a couple months ago and have woken up twice to hysterical sobbing, with someone repeatedly saying ""get the fuck away from me."" The first time this happened, I woke up disoriented and confused because I did not think anyone even lived in the apartment next to us, so I went and knocked on the door. The woman who answered played it off, saying her girlfriend was drunk and upset about losing her job. This didn't seem right to me, but I exchanged numbers with her and decided to keep an ear out in the future. 

Last night, I again overheard loud crying. I put my ear to the wall and took notes on what I heard, and it went something like ""Stop. What are you doing? Get off of me! What's the point of this? Stop touching me. Why are you touching me! ow!‚Äù I heard a growl from their dog, followed by ""I don't know why it has to hurt... why are you like this... I don't know why you had to wake me up... you just had to grab my hair and I wasn't even doing anything wrong... I made you late? for what? There's no point to this. I don't understand. I was sleeping fine. You just woke me up and had to be a fucking asshole. Stop touching me."" I did hear thuds that could be objects being thrown, but it was faint and unclear.

I am very confident there is abuse going on, but there has never been violence that is clearly audible to the point that I am confident that calling the police is the right move. I'm also conflicted because I've heard that involving law enforcement can make things worse for the victim if their abuser takes it out on them. I know the victim just moved from out of state, has no friends here and no job, and considering they are a very young lesbian couple, there's also a possibility that they do not have family to turn to either. I do not think she has a clear way out and I would not want to make her living situation worse for her.

I have reached out to building management to let them know that I am concerned about my neighbors and also asked if it would be possible to get their contact info. I never see the victim in the hall without her partner and have no way of speaking to her one on one, but if I get her number I would like to let her know that we are a safe place that she can come if she ever needs to.

domesticviolence,"I work as a behaviour support clinician, and I met with the Mum of two of my clients today after she dropped off the radar for a couple of months. 

She is late 30's, with an 11 year old who is currently exploding with anger (not my client), and two younger children both with level 3 ASD. 

It was three hours of counselling her and teaching her about the cycle of abuse. What she told me was exactly what I lived for 9 years (and still being manipulated 18 months after I called the police and broke up with him (4 years in the making). It was uncanny. The events that led to our DVOs were almost identical. 

We had only intended to meet for an hour, but one thing led to another and I feel so privileged that I could give her validation and support. I've offered for her to have mail sent to the office as she makes preparations, and she's coming in each week (sometimes twice a week) with one or both children. I told her that this is a safe place for her. If she needs to make phone calls, she can freely without having to account to her partner and face his interrogation. 

I had to leave for my second job shortly afterwards, and my ex started messaging me asking if I would be home this afternoon, demanding to know what time I would be leaving work. Saying ""You can see how that makes it difficult for me to know what to do"" because he wanted to come over after work. 

I reflected on what I'd spoken about and taught this woman today, and I felt angry that he was trying to guilt me into doing what he wanted.

- She's 23, just graduated college but despite applying to a ton of places locally, can't pick up a job

- Due to above, she was forced to move in with her mother and is now financially dependent on her

- Context on her mother: Gf just went to the hospital last night with multiple broken ribs, internal bleeding etc because of her mother (she's still there right now); passed out from pain/blood loss within an hour (fortunately still got to the doctor in time)

She doesn't have a penny to her name and wants to leave PR, and especially her mother, but doesn't know how because the only family she has stateside (NY) she hadn't spoken to in years until recently (she's been trying to reach out to them and develop a rapport with before just asking if she can move in with them but that's taking time she doesn't have).

We literally never have light hearted conversations but I like his soul. He volunteers. He reads a lot and follows the news. He writes songs and music. He isn‚Äôt self centered. We went to fish store and he bought his daughter a decent aquarium and a beta fish. He set it up correctly but the fish killed him self..... he jumped out of tank but with bad luck he was able to slide the lid enough to get completely out and died on the floor. I can‚Äôt help but wonder, is this a sign?? I am not a person to believe in these things but he is so crazy intense and I know that many men that have violent tendencies are too. I often avoid his texts and calls because they are just too much too fast. A 5 minute voicemail all about how much he loves me and how he is nothing like those ‚Äúother guys‚Äù.   If I don‚Äôt return his call immediately he is convinced I am breaking up with him. Sometimes I make any excuse to get out of the apartment just for a breather from talking about so many heavy topics.

I hope this is not seen as self promotion.  It is not.  I wrote this essay for a class in Jr. college actually a long time ago now.  I wrote it for the educational benefit, and as a kind of therapy -- as I Had just left an abusive marriage and in some ways, I was looking back and learning, looking at the present and wondering, and looking to the future with hope that it would not be a rerun.

I shared it originally, and still am, as simply an experience and details to share with those interested--another woman going through the same situations, an explanation to her children about what a mom might go through before she leaves that horrible situation, to the perpetrator, maybe if they see it from another point of view they will stop??? (that was probably a dream).

I come from a really unhealthy and dysfunctional family.  I continued the mess when I married the first time and made my own.  To this day, I'm trying to clean up the mess.  In fact, I'll probably be doing that the rest of my life.  But, I am trying.  The good news is that things get better.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.

I still share for all the same reasons.  I hope it helps someone.  Its not a really good academic work, but it's something simple that can be understood that might open the door for someone.

Today, I am a student at OSU (Oregon State), 57 yrs. old, on my 2nd marriage.  My kids are grown and out of the house.  In most ways, things just keep getting better.  At least in terms of not being with an abuser, and my own recovery.  Between my childhood and adulthood I have today, complex PTSD, anxiety stuff, depression, etc.  But, the fight continues and I encourage anyone and everyone in these horrible situations to come out swinging (in a metaphorical way) and care for yourself first.  If you don't care for you, how in the world will you ever be able to care for those kids?

It is not about him (or her, if she's the abusive one).  It's about you.  Getting you out, safe, and free from being terrorized.  It's about you being healthy.  It's about you taking your power back and giving voice to your experiences.

This happened a little over a year ago. 

We met 7 months ago, and roughly 8 months since the episode. We were casual for a long time because she clearly felt she wasn‚Äôt ready (and I understood),  up until a month ago when we decided to be together. 

For the most part it‚Äôs been great, but she warned me of potential issues that could arise which I am now seeing. I do feel like I put more into it than she does in the sense that she has a hard time opening up. It‚Äôs frustrating for me but I totally understand it. I‚Äôve assured her I‚Äôll be patient.

domesticviolence,"I wanted to get this off my chest. I recently left a relationship of a year and a half. His moments of anger started off innocent enough and just seemed the stress of his career was taking a toll on him.  They were unpredictable and I could never see them coming. 

He is proficient in combat sports and I also had experience as well, so on occasion we‚Äôd ‚Äòplay fight‚Äô . This started off as being a joking/playful thing and occasionally he‚Äôd make comments that he would use this to ‚Äúteach me a lesson‚Äù. Sometimes this would lead to sex so it came across as more of a fetish. 

When arguments would occur it would result in him grabbing my wrist so hard that they would bruise and hurt for days. This started happening every time we‚Äôd argue. I‚Äôd complain or try to break away and he wouldn‚Äôt let go and squeeze tighterZ His eyes would look black. When he wasn‚Äôt angry he was always remorseful and said he promised not to do it again.  He also became more violent when it came to sexual experiences and would often do things without my consent or pressuring me into something.  He said he had a rape fantasy and I was being a good girlfriend by appeasing him. When I suggested using a safe word he refused without any explanation. When I questioned him he got angry and said it was because he said so.

I am a educated independent women and never thought I‚Äôd end up in a situation like this.   I decided to confront him on his behavior, thinking it was just a misunderstanding or him not really understanding how his behavior was effecting me. I calmly tried to sit down and talk to him about how I didn‚Äôt like him forcefully pushing me around, grabbing, slapping etc. He raged. I‚Äôve never been so fearful in my life. I couldn‚Äôt see anything but black in his eyes. He was inches from my face and I could see his fist balled up and shaking. He kept shouting at me that I am not a victim. That was shocking for me. I never once described myself to him or to anyone else as a victim- I was his girlfriend. I realize you can be both.  This became a common occurrence throughout our relationship.  I thought that every couple has struggles and that you just had to work through them. He would always be very kind and sweet after and I was naive enough to give him the opportunity to do it again. 

I gained enough courage to end the relationship. Now that I‚Äôm removed from it, I can truly see how abusive he was to me. One of the many things he said that still haunts me is he told me if we were to ever break up and he saw me with another man, he didn‚Äôt think he could handle himself. When I asked him what he meant he said he would lose control and be filled with jealousy and rage. I asked if that would still apply if we amicably split up, or if he broke up with me/cheated. He said it didn‚Äôt matter. I would always be his. 

It‚Äôs been a 5 months. I sleep lighter now.  I‚Äôve started dating again, but I‚Äôm always looking over my shoulder. I‚Äôm worried he might see me out with someone else or catch me in a moment where I‚Äôm not paying attention. I‚Äôm worried about what he would do.

I don‚Äôt know what to think at this point. My mom was abused by my dad this morning. I always thought of my dad and a smart and nice dude, but my parents have hated each other for really long.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it as it was really subtle and I thought that I just misheard. But today, she talked to me and told me not to tell anyone, and I agreed to.

He just repeatedly kicks her then leaves. My mom was bleeding just a bit, but nothing major happened to her. What made me the most upset was that I really looked up to my dad and this is what I hear from my mom, and I know that she wouldn‚Äôt lie to me like that.

domesticviolence,"I was in a really abusive relationship for 8 years. 
It‚Äôs caused what the doctors believe a life time of pain and exhaustion. I‚Äôll never, ever heal from it. 

I was always so loving, open to hugs and kisses and being close with someone. 

Now? I don‚Äôt feel love. Like ever. 

I‚Äôve ignored/ghosted my friends for months because the thought of having ANY relationship is exhausting. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care, but I don‚Äôt miss them either. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be bothered if they never spoke to me again. 

I have no desire to create any human connections. I have a child who is 7 and he is the *only* human I can be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with. He‚Äôs the only person I can cuddle and get close to without feeling disgusted and icky. My relationship with my son is amazing. He‚Äôs the only person I am healthy for. Which I know is not healthy. 

He‚Äôs never seen me have friends or other adults in my life apart from family members. I know that‚Äôs not good for him, either. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve lost every single piece of myself. I‚Äôm horrible, withdrawn, I hate relationships of *any* kind... It‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôve lost the ability to give a fuck about anyone but myself (and my son, of course). 

I don‚Äôt engage in any of my hobbies anymore, and every time I have tried I have hit a brick wall. I can‚Äôt think. I can‚Äôt create. I can‚Äôt move forward. 

Since the last assault, my memory has been awful. I honestly can‚Äôt remember what I did yesterday, let alone a week ago. And I mean AT ALL. Not a single part of yesterday is in my memory. I‚Äôm forgetting all the important milestones with my child. I won‚Äôt be able to tell him anything about his childhood because I will forget. 

I‚Äôm alive and breathing. But I am completely dead. I wish I was actually dead. It would be easier than feeling like this. 

I‚Äôve done therapy. I‚Äôve tried every single antidepressant the doctor can offer. (turns out I‚Äôm too medication sensitive. Yup, can‚Äôt even take antibiotics when I‚Äôm unwell without severe side effects.)

domesticviolence,"Sorry if I sound discombobulated. I need urgent help. I‚Äôm fucking terrified right now.

A couple months ago, I came here asking for advice, as my (46M) dad hit my (39F) mom in the head. The police got called and it was really ugly. I was going to go to the authorities about it until I eventually gave into their control and fear-mongering. 

However... lately, with some more events that have happened in my household, I have been strongly considering telling authorities and leaving. But I‚Äôm fucking terrified. What just happened earlier today made me even more terrified. I‚Äôm fucking frozen.

I told my friend‚Äôs family, aka my neighbors, about the abuse last summer. I didn‚Äôt want them to confront my parents about it for my safety, but I just wanted them to support me. They have. When my mom kicked me out on Halloween, they let me stay there. They‚Äôve given me clothes and food when I‚Äôve needed it. I‚Äôm thankful for that.

Naturally, though, they started to disconnect themselves from my parents. Her parents deleted them on Facebook, and my friend herself deleted and blocked my mom. She found out about this and she knows it‚Äôs due to me. She is demanding information about what we‚Äôve talked about, access to my phone, and that I cease all contact with them. I am not allowed to hang out with my friend anymore.

My own little brother ratted me out to my mom and told me that I talk about my parents‚Äôs abuse to my trusted friends. I guess he‚Äôs looked over my shoulder.

I got out of it for now, I made up a bunch of excuses and I‚Äôm planning to stage a ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù with my friend so I can make it look like I‚Äôm ‚Äúloyal‚Äù to them. I‚Äôve been excused of being a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù and my mom told me I‚Äôm abusing everyone and that  I have no loyalty. I want to run away.

I also want to call DHS... but if they come to investigate, my parents will know it is because of me, and I will likely have to experience more violence and abuse as a result. They will do whatever they can to get my brother and I back. I‚Äôm afraid that, if I call DHS, I won‚Äôt end up alive. I‚Äôm so fucking scared I can‚Äôt think. I‚Äôm fucking shaking. This can‚Äôt be real. I want to disappear.

Every fiber inside me is telling me to run. I need to get somewhere safe. I‚Äôm strongly considering taking out my phone‚Äôs SIM card, packing up my identification (birth certificate, social security card, etc.), getting a job, and going to my boyfriend‚Äôs for a while.

domesticviolence,"Hello,

I   am hoping someone can help by referring resources. I'll try to make my   very long story short. I was in a very violent relationship (suffered   concussions and injuries to legs and arms) and forced to quit my job  and  move out of my apartment bc I feared my ex doing more harm to   me-threats were made that I would be killed. I have been hit in the head   with a gun by my ex, so I did not take those threats lightly. My ex  has  since been arrested and sentenced to years in prison. Here's the   problem, when you are a domestic violence survivor, battered women   shelters offer you a place to live, but once the abuser has been   convicted and detained, you're out of luck and the shelters will not   help you because ""you're no longer in danger"".

I   am now homeless and unemployed in Los Angeles, and although I have   contacted 211 for help, the organizations are overwhelmed and cannot   help. I am college educated and just need an opportunity to get back on   my feet. I have a car, but if I do not find a job soon, it may be   repossessed. I never thought I would experience something this painful   and traumatic.  I am a very private person, so posting this is   humiliating, but I am out of options. I grew up in foster care, so do   not have support from family or friends. This is depressing and I am   ready to give up.

I am posting this on different groups bc I am not sure where to go for help.

domesticviolence,"
On NYE, my mom called my brother (28M) and I in for a family meeting, and told us that my dad and her had gotten into a fight while driving. She had been nagging him about picking at his teeth, and he got so mad that he hit her and said (in our native language) ‚Äúyou never learn, how many times will I have to hit you for you to know your place‚Äù etc. My mom turned the car around and came back to tell us, while he was there.

My brother was shocked and confused. But I wasn't surprised because when I was 16 something similar happened. That time they kept arguing, with my dad getting more aggressive, and I was so scared I called a domestic abuse hotline. And in our daily lives, he makes these cutting, belittling remarks at her that are cruel. 

That night, we talked to them and separated them. As planned, my mom flew out of the country a few days later to visit family. But now she's coming back early (tomorrow, in fact) and I'm really panicked and I don't know what to do. 

My family never talked any of this afterwards, except this text my mom sent to me and my brother (below). It breaks my heart that she thinks this relationship is a normal marriage. She doesn't deserve to be treated this way. As I've grown up, I've tried to help with her burdens around the house, make her feel more appreciative and listened to (main complaints). But I feel like I should have done more and something sooner. Now, she doesn't seem to feel like she's in any physical danger. But I'm still afraid something will happen. 

My brother and I are both financially independent and could try to support her if needed. But my mom made it clear to me NYE that she doesn't want to talk about her feelings or be pitied. The only thing she told me is that I should talk to my dad if I wanted too. 

I can barely think about this issue without feeling like I'm 16 and breaking down. And honestly, part of me feels resentful that I've been asked/felt compelled to feel like a mediator at such a young age. My home life also was shitty for other reasons. 

I'd appreciate any resources, guides, or personal anecdotes about how to proceed now. (Though yes, I am trying to go see a therapist, and yes, I have ""Why Does He Do That"" which I highly recommend). 

(Idk how to attach an image, so this is what her text said:

 Just boarded.  
Very sorry for what happened on New Year‚Äôs Eve.  
I lost control. I just¬† wanted to make a point that I did not accept to be treated with mean language and wanted to be respected.¬† I got you two involved just to make this¬† point straight.

We confronted her about it and she turned her back on us and made us feel like it was all out fault, she played the victim, made everyone turn their back on us and threatened to kill herself.

domesticviolence,Since moving out I've still continued seeing him and since my last post I saw him again which I feel so stupid for. I've been struggling with food money and also one of the house mates was being innapropriate which I complained about to landlord. When things aren't going well it draws me back to him. The last few days he has kept telling me that I'm welcome to move back in which I didn't. Well whenever I see him when we sleep together he purposely hurts me and does things that I've told him many times to not do. He didn't use to do this all the time. it's only since I've moved out. During arguments while living together he choked me so for that reason I'm scared of my head or neck being touched. While sleeping together lately he's started choking me. I've told him beforehand each time to not even touch that area at all and he says he won't and still does it. I'm not sure why as he's not even angry and we aren't fighting when this happens.

domesticviolence,"I wrote in this sub a long time ago, asking for advice on how to leave and explaining what was happening. I ended up deleting the post out of fear that he would somehow see it and physically hurt me again for speaking about the things that happened. But one day, early in the morning he started to get angry with me. He found one of the baby's toys not in her bin, and I had left one of my boots on the floor when we had gotten home the previous night. He became angry, violent, and mentally abusive in a matter of seconds. Screaming at me, calling me every name there was. Throwing the baby's toys and my boot at me. And something just clicked on my mind, and said ""Hey, if you stay today you are going to be seriously hurt again."" So I grabbed the baby's bottles from the kitchen and I locked she and I in our bedroom and began to pack. I called my mother, and soon my parents showed up. I took some things and I left him that day. Eight months later, and now I'm in a very happy healthy relationship. Having a baby, and moving into an apartment with someone who I love and who loves me just as much. I'm extremely happy. I got a pfa against my ex for a while and dropped it recently to allow him to see our daughter. He is very good to her and we coparent well. 

That being said, if you are wondering how on earth you'll feel or be without someone who is abusing you, I promise you will feel liberated. You will find unbelievable happiness, and you will find yourself again. I have never felt more whole in my life, and I regret nothing other than not leaving sooner.

domesticviolence,"Hi, I have a question about stalkers, need some opinions on a situation‚Ä¶

My best friend is being stalked by her ex.  They broke up over a year ago.   About 4 months ago she got a restraining order.

He‚Äôs been bypassing it in various ways, following her, manipulating her daughter through other people, etc‚Ä¶ All in ways hard to prove to the police so it just keeps continuing‚Ä¶  He‚Äôs obsessed with her 6 year old daughter, its creepy.  (Got her pic as his facebook profile even) ‚Äì It‚Äôs not his kid.  He‚Äôs a 51 year old biker drug addict obsessed with a 6 year old girl and her mom.  She‚Äôs 37.

She‚Äôs bipolar and has been very stable for a long time until this stuff started, this is causing some serious issues, breaking her down, rapid cycling, even suicidal thoughts‚Ä¶ Isolated herself from everyone, shut down her facebook entirely, etc.  

What‚Äôs worse, is she is a gun owner, but because of how she‚Äôs felt mentally she gave her gun to her family, which means she doesn‚Äôt have proper protection.

I want to help her, but I‚Äôm on an island 2000 miles away (moved away 11 year ago).

In my opinion, she should move out here for a year or so.  I‚Äôm a longtime friend of her family, known her since she was a kid, she knows she‚Äôs safe here and stuff (I‚Äôm one of her closest friends).  I‚Äôm on a beautiful island, and every inch of my property is covered by security cameras.  It‚Äôs very safe/secure here.  

Her stress would go away, her bipolar would calm down, she could go back to being happy and mentally healthy.  She‚Äôd go home in a much better mental and financial state.   Even she knows that would be the result of coming‚Ä¶

Only thing keeping her from doing it, is she fears that it wouldn‚Äôt matter, that when she goes back, he‚Äôs just going to be there waiting, and then her restraining order stuff would have to start over again and she‚Äôd have to go through even more of the process.  

Asshole has her conditioned into thinking she needs to accept he‚Äôs always going to be part of her life, that she‚Äôll never be able to make him go away. (I disagree)  ‚Ä¶  She points at his ex, previous to her‚Ä¶  He still bugs her from time to time, finds ways to get involved with her life‚Ä¶  His previous ex has just given up and accepted he won‚Äôt go away‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right way to deal with this shit.

I think if she came here for a year or so, and went back at a random time down the road, and severed ties with anyone connecting him to her, got a job at a different place, new place to live‚Ä¶ He probably wouldn‚Äôt know she was back, and enough time would pass that hopefully his attention will have shifted to something else so he wouldn‚Äôt even be looking at that point.

I‚Äôm worried if she doesn‚Äôt get some distance, get to a safe place that things are just going to go one of 2 ways, he‚Äôs either going to escalate till she/her daughter get hurt, or she‚Äôs going to give up and accept he‚Äôs never going to go away, which is going to fuck with her bipolar endlessly, shutting her down in many ways.

How do I convince her my idea is way better than staying and dealing with it hoping it gets better?

domesticviolence,"My story's a long one, but I'll cut it short as possible:

Y'see I'm adopted, the circumstances of why, because my biological mother almost beat me to death .. was jailed for it and then on the 2nd occurrence was forced into giving me up for adoption.

Later on, was adopted by this couple, seemed to take good care of me until I was 5 .. then started up abusing me again, pulling my hair, slapping me across the face if I didn't do something they approved of, even had my handheld games (y'know the LCD type with the button batteries .. those!) smashed if I didn't do something right ..

Anyway this kinda abuse continued over the years .. until my adoptive father passed away back in the late 1990's, I decided to stick with her, purely for the company, and besides I didn't like the idea of living on my own.. The abuse turned into several arguments, one resulting with me moving out for about half the year interstate, and then moving back when I didn't have a place to stay at anymore (as was living with a girl I had met several years earlier.

Fast forward to now .. I'm still living with her (you're thinking to yourselves okay how can he put up with so much .. right?) things have heated up quite a fair bit because I used to pay some of the bills around the house, but then stopped, because hey why should I reward someone for their toxic attitude?! Simple equation .. speak to me like I'm worth nothing to you, and you get nothing in return ..   Anyway so what's happened as of recent is I've stopped paying bills etc for her realizing her true motive .. she's out to abuse me and get stuff done by me, bills paid etc ... Here's something else, she is on blood pressure medication, and she does like a drink or two .. maybe more .. I have a feeling that the alcohol is mixing with the tablets/medication she's taking .. leading her into the rather violent abusive behaviour in which she has thrown stuff at me like one night, sitting at the table for dinner, she gets fairly wound up and throws a table knife at me .. missed though and hit the cabinet behind me.

I have called the cops on her because I have felt rather unsafe in the house, as per instruction by one of the online counselling websites .. she has said that if I call the cops again she will kill me .. I doubt she will do it .. but hey there's no telling with her .. I have, on my possession a recording device, I have on several occasions gathered evidence of her being abusive and threatening towards me .. even one with her stating to me that what should happen if the cops were called again.

My question is: Should I try and hang the fact that I have possible pieces of evidence of her abusive behaviour against her, take it to a solicitor and get legal advice? Or should I keep my mouth shut, try and find a way out, once out, seek legal advice and then look to raise a case against her ?

This brought up a lot for me unexpectedly. I thought back to two times in my life when I have been strangled. The first was when I was at school and only a child, I laughed at a boy at school and he became angry pushed me up against a wall and strangled me. I told no one. 
The second time it was my brother, I had gotten angry over something and he was using the computer and I switched it off at the wall. He got angry and pushed me up against a wall and strangled me. I told no one. I was 15 at the time he was 17.
I know these are two isolated incidents, but its brought up a lot for me and other things which I don't want to or feel like I'm unable to share here (in the past not current).

domesticviolence,"Hello,

I'm in need of advice I really don't know what to do. My girlfriend (23) still lives with her parents and her brother (21?). 

Ever since she was little her parents began to hit her. As her brother got older he started hitting her as well. 

I don't want to go too much into details but nowadays the father doesn't hit her anymore (he's stopped alcohol) but he doesn't care when he sees the mother/brother trying to hit my GF. The mother drinks every day and blames her daughter for everything. 

Her brother is now 21ish and weights 85kg (~190lbs). He hits really hard. He also tries to strangle her every now and then. Normally he doesn't do all that shit when I'm around but one day I was there and I tried to defend her but he pulled a knife on me.

My GF doesn't want me to call the police since there'll be significant consequences (basically if police shows up she's gonna get jumped by all her family later on).

How can I help her? She wants me not to do anything before she get her own home so she can be save.

At the moment she works but earn less than minimum wage. I'm not working for now but I want to.

domesticviolence,"Dear Survivor,

I know the pain you suffer. I‚Äôve felt the words and strikes and manipulation you endure. I want you to know, you‚Äôre not alone. You are not weak. Or worthless. Pathetic. Needy, attention-seeking, or annoying. It is not your fault. And as hard as it is to hear, you can‚Äôt fix it...

But I want to share my story with you. So you can know what I‚Äôve lived‚Äîthe same life as you. So you can know I‚Äôve feared and anguished and wept‚Äîthe same ways as you. And so you can know that I‚Äôve seen the end, reaching for that chance at a better life‚Äîthe same hope as you.

My story begins with two text messages and a voicemail. Left in despair and anger, over the abuse that was done and a push for change. They were all he had against me, and he thought he‚Äôd won. He was sure he‚Äôd won. And I was too. But I had mountains of evidence, texts, calls, videos, and images to show he was a terrible abuser. However, none of it mattered except the three contacts I‚Äôd made paired with large, exaggerated claims and a charming, snake-oil salesman smile... so I had to learn a few hard lessons. He was still abusing me from afar. He had used the same tactics against me towards others to quickly gain their favor (and tout I was a ‚Äúpsycho cunt‚Äù who was mentally unstable and struggling with addiction) to all who would listen. And the justice system is bullshit.

My abusive ex, after ending our relationship two days after my 30th birthday v√≠a an assault and text message, moved forward recently to file for a protective order because he ‚Äúwas in fear for his life‚Äù  regarding me. He *blatantly lied and falsified claims for police reports that nearly got me labeled a committer of Family Violence* (of which I had ample evidence that his timeline and claims are unfounded), and I was the one being abused! He did it to try and ensure I was made homeless because I would‚Äôve been kicked out of my residence as mother owns a daycare in her, and my temporary, home, and it‚Äôs against state licensure to house a family ‚Äúabuser‚Äù. And he knew I‚Äôd lose my teaching license for good due to another state law that is allowed to go executed without proper burden of proof.

But he failed to wrongfully label me his batterer and abuser in a court of law... 

He called multiple times to the cops, lying that I was committing crimes or wielding weapons for suicide attempts to try and get my marked insane, even though his abuse did make me want to commit suicide. I have half a dozen beat cops who agreed he was physically assaulting me at the very least, but not a single detective will return my calls so I can follow through with charges against him for domestic violence. He even erased the security camera footage (which I had copies of) from the dates I was abused on camera in the front yard or driveway to obstruct justice. 

But he will fail at preventing me from justice...

I‚Äôm out thousands of dollars for therapy and medication and multiple lawyers to fight this evil narcissist and his destruction. I‚Äôve lost a home I co-own (name is on lease and title) against my will. I am having my credit ruined via unpaid bills for an AC unit he couldn‚Äôt get financing for (so it‚Äôs solely in my name but being used by him and household). He purposefully sent my boss a handwritten letter with reports outing me as being arrested for drug possession (planted‚Äîand all my drug screens/hair follicles prove I was clean for a period *prior* to the arrest of 90 days), as well as sharing my alcohol addiction struggles and mental health issues‚Äîand this cost me my job as well as future ones as an educator (and I can‚Äôt prove it was discrimination for them to do so). He is breaking our legally binding buyout agreement I was threatened into signing via multiple ways (some used police action), as well as failed to make my monthly payments agreed to so I can recoup the $13k I invested (alone, I later realized, as he actually put no money in our joint account) in buying our ‚Äúdream home‚Äù that was to be made a rental income for us to split later down the road. 

But he failed to see me dejected and alone...

Financially ruined, in debt, nearly homeless, jobless, abused, reneged against, and severely depressed, I lay helplessly in a spare room at my parents in my bed‚Äîamidst walls of unpacked boxes and piles of belongings. I wanted this nightmare to end. I wanted him to suffer. But the saddest part? I wanted to die.

All of this he had done and is doing with no consequences... *YET.* The universe may see fit to right the wrongs, he may be his own demise, or I may be successful with my proceedings against him moving forward‚Äîand no matter what I had to accept it would be alright. When I wanted to scream and cry and claw my face up or tear my hair out in agony, *it was going to be alright* again.

And no matter what, he has failed to break me. No matter how hard and how far he is willing to push and stoop and scrape to force me down under his control again, he was going to fail...

In therapy today, I was told ‚Äúif you survived the abuse, you *can* survive the recovery.‚Äù 

But even broken, jaded, untrusting of anyone‚Äôs ulterior motive, sick with anxiety and fear, unjustly done, or unsure of who someone really is within, I will *NOT* allow these wounds to be the end of me. 

I will *NOT* allow him the control of occupying my thoughts or plans or musings anymore.

I will *NOT* let him abuse me any longer. 

And just as I survived my abuse, I *WILL* survive my recovery‚Äîinto a better life and self than I could ever have imagined without him before. 

The world may not be just or fair, but those of us who are survivors of abuse or neglect or toxicity, we have a choice: to stop the abuse, hard as it is, and move forward with letting go; to learn to self-love again; to say ‚Äúno more‚Äù to being used or controlled or manipulated; to take charge of our lives; and to focus on our‚Äîand *only* our‚Äîhealing. It‚Äôs a long, shitty, difficult road, but we can create our own justice‚Äîand that is living a life where we never focus on anything beyond ourselves, our loved ones, and our futures. While they continue to scheme and trick and connive, trapped in their cycle of misery, we are strong once again. And we are *free.* üíú 

Stay strong out there, for those of you who have exited a relationship and still struggle or those of you who have yet to find strength to leave. Know you always have someone to talk to for any reason, any time‚Äîjust PM me, please. And find love and support to surround yourself with for all the ups and downs and in-betweens.

It‚Äôs together, united and introspective, supported and strong, that we survive our recovery: to a new life, a new future, and a new you. One deserving of love. And one worth everything and anything in the world. üíõüß°‚ù§Ô∏èüíöüíôüíú",A letter to a Survivor,ELfit4life,2020-01-31 05:37:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ewjmkn/a_letter_to_a_survivor/,3,1.0,7,5,1237

I was asleep and woke up to the sound of screaming and loud thumping. I could clearly hear words and phrases, a woman's voice yelling ""why did you do it"" and calling someone terrible names, and it lasted for maybe 10 minutes. I ended up having flashbacks and hyperventilating but later encountered someone from that household outside. I have been informed the mom is bipolar and her behavior is treated by this person as just an unfortunate thing to live with. I feel incredibly distressed partly because of my own experiences and partly because I feel a young child is being abused in a household where the only other adult is complacent. I don't know what to do, if there even is anything I can or should do. But considering I come from a home where screaming and throwing furniture (chairs!) was routine, I feel an overwhelming sense of needing to do something.

domesticviolence,"Hi reddit,

Created a spare account because I don't wish to be identified by my family. I'm in a bit of a situation now that I need some advice. I hesitate to go to a lawyer mainly because I don't know if it's a good idea to escalate things to that extent.

To give some background, my brother has a record of being violent and abusive. To give an example of physical violence, he would use dining chairs to hit us (the siblings), and had threatened to hit our parents a few times.

Today, he threw/hid my keys in the morning and prevented me from going to work. As a result, I'm unable to leave the house, and thanks to him removing all cooking utensils, I have no way to cook for myself either. Gonna have to survive on a bag of potato chips and water till 8\~9pm

Would anyone have any suggestions on how I should approach this? I had considered filing a police report a few times, but given that it happens within the family, there's very little evidence beyond bruising etc, I'm not sure if there's a case. Moreover, as a male, I'm not sure if the domestic violence protection applies to me. In addition, I'm also not sure if in the case today, it constitutes wrongful confinement given that I'm trapped in my own house. I intend to confront him tonight over his actions today, and am expecting it to turn violent. I'm still considering how I should deal with this situation, would appreciate any inputs.  


\*Update 1\* I want to thank everyone who've given me solid advice over a difficult situation. I managed to avoid any further confrontation over the last few days, and I've approached one of the family violence specialist centres near me like what others have suggested below.

Her mother's mom died at 16. Her dad's mom is the only one in her family that's actually pretty cool with her. My friend can't take her in his house due to his strict mother but I've offered to take them in mine so they can at least get a bit of privacy.

She told him a lot of horrible stuff about her past and current life but I'm not going to go into that, just going to call her mom less of a human being and more of an animal.

Another problem is that she has a sister that's about ~7 years old and she's the one getting beaten up and yelled up for days if her sibling lies about something while her sibling doesn't have any domestic violence trouble related to it.

We know that she's been beaten up since she was just a kid and all the abuse just increased with time, her mom would make her do stupid and gross things if she would cry. Last night specifically she laid on the floor while getting the belt so she wouldn't get bruises on her front parts and to make her mother stop quicker. The worst part of all of this is that she thinks what she's going through is normal and didn't try to seek out any help thinking that everyone was like her.

After her escaping her mom what we're afraid of are possible suicide attempts, using drugs, getting STIs, start smoking and getting drunk, and generally trying to live the life she never had.


Child protection services and foster care system in our country isn't quite great but is absolutely not terrible.

He thinks that I need to go to therapy for paranoia (which yes, I do but I don't have the time or the money) and that if I'm with him my abuser and his goonie friends will be too afraid to do anything. He also thinks that it's only a matter of time before my abuser ends up dead from an OD or in jail, so if I stick it out all my problems will probably go away.

Background - we have lived together since Feb. 2017. There have been three occasions at which things have sort of gotten physical but not quite. Once where he slapped a bottle out of my hand, once where he jerked a couch cushion out from behind my head and then today where he just followed me to every room, pushed himself against me and screamed and yelled at me that I needed to ‚Äúlisten to him‚Äù. Today was by far the worst.. 

I told him he needed to go to anger management and he agreed but hours later told me he could work on himself by himselfZ I feel now it‚Äôs two battles. One just to get him to see he has a problem and then to actually try to get help for that problem.

My coworker comes from a background of childhood sexual abuse and has really low self esteem. She has no close family and no friends outside work. Her boyfriend pays her rent and for her food. He drives her everywhere and is her only way to get around. She doesn't come out with us much for work parties because her BF doesn't want to drive her/tells her that she is slutty when he isn't around and doesn't trust her- so he is very controlling of her and tries to isolate her.

In the last two months this escalated. He began calling her a slut and a whore and telling her that he wants to kill her and wishes he could strangle her. He has also punched walls and doors near her when arguing and blows up for no reason. I am the only one she tells this to because she trusts me. I have tried to talk to her about it as abuse without telling her flat out ""you have to leave him"" because I don't want her to stop telling me things and isolate herself with him.

Last night I got a text from her at 5:20am that said ""(BF) tried to kill me tonight. I am safe. please don't tell anyone. I am safe."" along with the text was a picture of her mirror selfie style in a bathroom with a robe on.

Other times, he would physically force himself on me. Once, I voiced that he was hurting me one night and he told me that I needed to just take the pain.

domesticviolence,"TL;DR on the bottom.

Please forgive the wonky formatting, I'm writing this in the bathroom on my phone with shakey hands.  

This morning at 4:30 my boyfriend began yelling at me right in my face. He is a big guy and it was really loud. Telling me all the different ways in which I am not enough. He goes into work at 6:00 am and I get up with him and make his breakfast and pack him a lunch. I'm an early riser and I love preparing food for him (at least I used to). He used to be super gracious and praise me on his fabulous homemade packed lunches and creative breakfasts. He told me about how all the guys at work were jealous of his lunch It made me feel good. 

But not this morning. Today at 4:45 he told me ""Frittata again? And what are you packing me for lunch? Remember I work overtime. Did you know when I open my lunch bag I've been disappointed as many times as I've been delighted? I give so much more than I get from you!"" 

I said that wasn't cool of him to say and that I don't have to do this for him, I choose to and that's when he completely went off the rails on numerous tangents about many things are wrong with me - at full screaming volume right in my face. 

This is not the first time he has done this. He rarely apologizes. It feels like more and more he's testing the waters to see what else I'll take. He always ""love bombs"" me after a while, praising me and all that I do with the vernacular of a poet, and I forget these moments when he sprays me with venom.

I can't move out and I can't kick him out, he and his daughter (8) live in my apartment and don't have resources to move. His daughter calls me mommy (her bio mom is absentee) I've got two young daughters that I have shared custody of. This is my weekend with them but after this morning I feel like this could possibly escalate further and I don't know if my kids should be around? I'm scared and feel so powerless. He really made me feel so worthless today. I feel physically weak from it. 


TL;DR:

I have been in an abusive relationship since I was 19 I am now 22.

I am terrified for my life. I cant get rid of him. I have tried breaking up but he wont let me. I used to live with him but moved out when the neighbour knocked on door, he made me answer the door and that was the first time I have ever told someone what was happening. She encouraged me to call police but people don't understand he has a dog and cat and I don't want to look after them if he goes to prison, plus I doubt the police will even believe me. Anyway. he has pulled me down stairs, dragged me across floor by my hair and strangled me many times. He used to like to push me in bath with hand around my neck and turn cold shower on. He tried to drown me in bath once. Police were called by neighbours in house we previously lived in but I lied and honestly this is the worst mistake, bar meeting this pathetic piece of shit, of my life. They took me away and asked if something was wrong and I so so so wanted to tell them but my stupid brain still loved this abusive arsehole so I couldn't do it. I got the feeling they knew I wasn't being truthful. He was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer when they came to the house for around the 8th time. I had to go to court with him. I didn't lie under oath, I didn't see him hit the police officer, but I just wish I told them what was happening to me.

He told me he was going to change, so last week moved into a flat. I wasn't on the tenancy for this house, as the other 2 house we lived in he had damaged so much I was sick. Anyway, back to the flat. He hasnt changed at all. I had to escape today and now I am sitting in my dads house (where i live now) terrified. I am writing this because he knows where I live. Im scared. I am waiting to hear his car pull up outside, for him to slam the door and kick the door down like he has threatened. I have a set of keys to his new flat and I still have them and this is what it is all about - he wants the keys back, and I am far too scared to see him again. Im terrified please someone help me I cant even tell you how scared I am i cant see my eyes are dripping. i told him to ring police and i would give the keys to them or to ring the police and ill meet him with the police present i dont know what to do. 

He was in care and blames this on his mother who was abusice towards him as a child also blames it on autism but ive had autistic boyfriend before and he wasnt like this.please help i have schizophrenia and i dissosiate a lot with abuse and i cant help myself i cant tell my dad, my dad will go afyer him and im scared my ex boyfriend will hurt him hes a very dangerous person.

domesticviolence,"After four years of being in a relationship with my (31F) abusive ex (32M), I finally got him out. Our relationship was not abusive every day, it came in waves, this included destruction of my property, stonewalling, emotional manipulation of all kinds and 5 incidences of physical abuse. It was never bad enough to where you would see the injuries aside from one occasion when he attacked me while my back was turned and I landed on the kitchen tile floor - hard. I had a swollen black and blue hand and a huge bruise on my leg. Even that didn‚Äôt get me to ask for help. What finally did it was two weeks ago when before I had my entire family showing up for a birthday dinner, we had an argument two hours before everyone was coming, and he hulk smashed his way thru my entire home, while I ran and locked myself in a bedroom and finally did what I should‚Äôve done a long time ago and called the police for help (as he desperately was trying to break down the door). I was terrified, embarrassed that I allowed these things to happen more than once. But I had enough. And then once he was taken away I called my family and I told them everything. My feelings of shame and not wanting to involve anyone, despite having amazing friends and a very loving and supportive family, always stopped me. I had never been in a situation like this. I allowed his empty promises and apologies and what I see now as probably fake guilt, let him stay. His own personal demons and pain from losses in his life made me think he just needed someone to really love him and it would stop. I could fix him. And I was so scared to let my friends and family down, to have to admit I brought this person into our lives, what would they think? How much is this going to effect them also when they have done nothing but be great to me? 

Well if anyone is reading this, you can‚Äôt fix them. It isn‚Äôt your job too. It only escalated and I have no doubt now that intended or not one of these days he would‚Äôve shoved me down some stairs, in one of his fits of rage and maybe paralyzed me or worse killed me. And telling my family was hard but once I did, they went into protect mode and for the first time in a long time I felt safe. I wish I had done it so much sooner. They allowed me to crumble for a few days, as they cleaned up the house, rented a storage unit, and got his shit out of here because it‚Äôs my house alone, not his. They found a therapist I will start seeing to get me thru because as my mom said, he was a ‚Äúreal motherfucker but we understand this is also the end of a long relationship and you‚Äôre allowed to be sad for all the reasons you need to be for a while, But you can‚Äôt live in the sadness, we won‚Äôt let you‚Äù. 

And it sounds so stupid to say I am sad because I loved him, but I know that as I get myself a little stronger each day, that he didn‚Äôt love me. He isn‚Äôt capable of love. Starting over is work and I‚Äôm sure a part of my hiding this awful secret from the people I love was also because I didn‚Äôt think I had the fight in me to be alone and go thru this alone, but In telling them I forgot that I wouldn‚Äôt be alone. There‚Äôs a saying that you never know how strong you are until it‚Äôs your only option. I thought for a long time, well this is it, maybe I don‚Äôt get the life I wanted and there is nothing better out there, no happy ending. And I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll ever have a relationship again or the family of my own that I always wanted, but I do know that there‚Äôs a possibility I may. And staying with him there was absolutely no possibility of it, ever. I knew I would never bring a child into that relationship. 

I have hope, and the comfort that while the unknown is scary, the unknown also offers possibilities. And anything is possible. Find your support system, swallow your pride, ask for help and you may be surprised at how much shows up at your door. It isn‚Äôt easy, ending it, but I have a strange sense of calm, and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve missed for a long time.

He said he is confused. I obviously got annoyed about that and said that it's him wanting control. He said to basically enjoy the new crap house. I called him an abuser (my previous posts has details of the verbal and physical abuse) and told him that yes, I'll enjoy not being beat on in the new room.

It's just because of everything that's happened prior and any other time he would say sorry and fight for it. One time basically holding me against my will in the old house. I just feel pathetic and worthless now more than ever. I don't know what to do. He's basically doing to me now what he did to the ex baby mother. She didn't act exactly how he wanted in the end so he just threw her away like trash. I think she begged him too. But later on got an order on him. He says I won't need an order because he doesn't want me and that he's happy when I leave him.
I was pregnant early on like the ex gf too. I litterely can't get over it. I wasn't over him the week I was gone but left for my safety. I honestly want to die.

domesticviolence,"Hello Reddit.  I come to you in a time of much distress.   A close and dear friend of mine is caught up in a difficult situation with her soon to be ex husband.  I dont even know where to start.  

&amp;#x200B;

Shes about 11 years into her marriage.  His control and emotional abuse has taken her to the point of trying to divorce him again.  On several occasions she has called the police and they have done nothing but seemingly take his side.  A couple months ago, the last time she tried getting help from police, they caught him in the act of disabling her car (so she couldnt leave and he could continue berating her and throwing things).  The police still insisted she leave and stay at her mothers!  He could have been cutting brake lines!  So now she has no faith in police intervention.  Her divorce attorney seems toothless, hes not giving her helpful advice.  Shes feeling hopeless and I know she has to get out of there.  

&amp;#x200B;

Last night he was driving and they started fighting.  He wouldnt let her leave the car.  Driving erraticly and rolling stop signs and otherwise being reckless.  For nearly an hour he did this to her so he could continue yelling and screaming without a chance of escape. Shes more afraid for her life than ever and so am i!

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is her battle, I know there isn't much I can do beyond giving her the best moral support I can muster.   Please, I ask for anything that I can do to help.  ANy breadcrumb that can lead to a solution, a hope, anything.  Can she try contacting a different police station the next city over?  Can she go over the cops heads somehow?  Does she need proof to file a PPO?  Why is her lawyer so useless?  Is there a support group of somekind?

-I have a security exterior screen door over my front door at my apartment. My ex used to show up banging, knocking and trying to bend back the metal to break in. Because of this, I have asked this new guy to not knock on my door and to call me when picking me up and I will come outside. The first time he knocked I let it slide as I hadn‚Äôt explained that yet. But he did it the next time, with the excuse that he wanted to say hi to my dog (???). Then he did it again with the excuse that I didn‚Äôt answer his message over Instagram that said ‚Äúhere‚Äù (we had been chatting on Instagram where he asked to ‚Äústop by and say hi‚Äù, I don‚Äôt get notifications for Instagram, but he still has my phone number so I don‚Äôt see why he didn‚Äôt just call me like I asked) 

-He seems manipulative. We made plans to go play pool together, and he let me know while he was on the way to my house that his friends were also coming. His friends ended up being 2 other couples. I was annoyed because it seemed he had intentionally planned it without telling me. We are not exclusive and I wouldn‚Äôt have introduced him to my friends at that point so I was confused.

-the day he asked to stop by and say hi, I had been telling him I had a birthday party to go to and I needed to nap beforehand. I figured he had stuff to do, that it would be a quick visit and he would leave. But he was at my for hours until I went to the birthday and I didn‚Äôt get any sleep.

domesticviolence,"I am literally lost in my mind right now. Some how I have spaced off for 3 days. Literally not living my computer chair. 

I \[29F\] and my ex \[29M\] (referencing him as Ronnie) and I were together for 3 years. We had the typical narcissistic (him)  / codependent (me) type relationship. I had to often bailed him out of dire situations (make car payments, pay court fines, cover the mortgage/all bills without his contribution). In addition to finances I did all chores regarding caring for all of the animals we had, any and all cleaning. Whatever, you get the story. He eventually began using drugs and things escalated to the extent that I couldn't handle it anymore. We broke up, he moved out 6 weeks later. 

Shortly after, a former ex \[33M\] (referencing him as Steve) and I start hanging out again. He was the typical #NiceGuy but I didn't recognize it at the time. He is at my house one night, we are getting ready to go to sleep but watching a movie. Ronnie starts calling me repeatedly. I have a bad feeling about this. I turn my phone into Do Not Disturb and do not receive notifications. Ronnie eventually shows up to my home and is knocking on the door. I ignore it. He is trying to talk to me through the window, telling me he's not trying to be weird but he needs to talk to me. It's close to 12 AM and I know that if I answer the door he is going to be inebriated and who knows what he is capable of if he knows that I have a guy over. 

He eventually kicks in the door and is very upset. I call the police. He said he came to get 2 of his left shoes (as in, he took the right ones). He starts screaming at me ""Does this dude f\*ck you like me? Does this dude eat your p\*ssy like me? I have f\*cked 15 girls since you, and they're way hotter."" I just keep asking him to please leave, the police arrive. He ends up obtaining the following charges in addition to a restraining order protecting me: domestic abuse, burglary in the 2nd, possession of meth, and weed.  

Fast forward 2 months: Steve is becoming very clingy. We go to lunch, come back from lunch and we are laying on his bed - head to feet. He pulls himself out of his pants and starts playing with himself. I tell him ""I don't know what you're getting yourself all jazzed up for, I have a stomach ache from lunch."" he says ""come here"" and I give somewhat of a chuckle of ""confusion"" and say ""no"" since I just made it clear that my stomach aches. 

He grabs a fistful of my hair, literally bending my neck back. He tries to readjust his group and I get free and my first response was to turn over onto my stomach to lift myself up, he gets on top of me and unbuttons my pants. He quickly pulls my pants down to my knees. I pull away and pull up my pants, grab a blanket and am trying to put it over me. He flips the blanket up from the end of my feet, pulls down my pants, moves and holds my legs over to the right exposing me and presses himself against me. It wasn't ""working"" because I OBVIOUSLY am not ""excited"" about what he's doing. He tries again, and again, and again and the next time it inserts. This time I literally just FROZE. I didn't make any movements. When it finally went in I said ""so this is what rape feels like"" and let out a heavy sigh. Unlike many others, I haven't experienced this as of yet. He stares at me blankly, still inside of me. I say ""might as well finish now"" and I laid there and stared at him. Afterwards there was blood, and he said ""wow, blood, just like a rape scene"". Afterwards he claims this is all a misunderstanding and claims that he was under the impression it was playful because of my laughing. I didn't think it was playful. Maybe all of this is a misunderstanding and from a different perspective I made it be playful. I can't get over it though, and I break it off. 

That all happened on Sunday, and today is Saturday. It's been almost a week, the first two days I spent in a drunken stupor, and the last 3 days and today I have been in what I think is disassociation. 

I don't know what I feel even. I feel like I want to call Ronnie and tell him what happened so bad. Ronnie did some really bad things to me, but I always felt safe with him. For some reason, even when he broke in my door I felt safe. I did not think Steve was safe though. I regret calling the cops. I wish none of this would have happened. I don't even know how to process this.

TLDR: Narcissist and codependent (my) relationship, 3 years. Narc kicks in codependent's (my) door to my house while I have a new dude there. Narc catches a lot of charges and a restraining order. New dude potentially sexually assaulted me. Now I am in a strange state of disassociation. I don't know how to break free from it, everything tastes like cardboard, I don't want to leave my house, answer my phone, and I can't sleep. I have been really fighting the urge to call Narc because of the restraining order, and because he also has a new girlfriend who I do sincerely hope he's happy with. However, he's been my best friend for 3 years.

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone,

I want to start of by saying that this is a burner account. In no way am I keeping this account after this discussion or connecting myself to my other account. I really need some help because I am torn and a complete mess right now, and I have no idea what to do. I'll tell the story as best as I can and hopefully receive some sound advice.

I met my wife almost ten years ago. We were madly in love, and still are, but it is starting to feel very much like the flavor of the day. The highs are high, but the lows are extremely low. We both came from some messed up childhoods and carried baggage into our marriage. I was abused verbally and physically. I would try to explain myself or say something and instead I was treated like I was in an interrogation. I was constantly told I was a fuck up, I wasn't allowed to say anything and then I had to take whatever punishment I received in silence, whether it was being hit repeatedly or carrying drywall by myself for hours and running hill sprints until I puked. I hate not being heard. I am fine with being wrong, but I want so badly to just be heard, to feel like a person.

My wife was hit a fair amount when she was younger, and her mom had an angry streak. I don't know all of the details, but she has suffered with depression for a long time. What has resulted is that she doesn't like people being angry or upset. When she does she either tries to fix it or cuts people off (do you see where this is going?).

Our marriage has been stressful, and early on in our marriage a fight would ensue over something stupid and mundane. I would get upset, she would get mad, I would try to talk, she would cut me off, and then I would shut down. She would yell at me to just talk and say what I had to, and when I tried she would talk over me and yell at me. Finally I would get so frustrated with trying to talk I would either leave or throw something. I never hit her or tried to throw anything at her. I often tried to leave the situation but couldn't. She would block the door or grab me forcefully or hit my chest.

Over the years we have gone to marriage counseling multiple times (I have always initiated it) and tried to work on our issues. I have always been brutally honest. I love this women with everything I have. I made a vow to her. What came is for me to count to ten, be more patient, touch her and kindly remind her that she is cutting me off. To let her know that I don't think its a good idea to talk right now, and that we can later but right now it is being tabled because she isn't respecting me as a person. Those talks haven't worked. I have tried to do all of those things and she still cuts me off, yells at me to just talk, and when I try to let her know she isn't treating me respectfully she just tells me to just talk then. When finally realize we need to stop the cycle and come back to this discussion later, she says no and tries to fix it.

This last Time was horrible. We had a fight a month ago that resulted in me saying ""I don't feel comfortable talking about this right now because you aren't being fair and respectful"" and she forcefully grabbed me and said no. She refused to let me leave. Then she just yelled at me. I ended up on the floor crying.

Now we've had another fight a week ago and I cannot stop thinking about it. She made a rude remark that was hurtful about our future and I said that it wasn't appropriate. I tried to have some space from her and she ripped into me. I tried talking in a normal voice to her sitting down and she just cut me off and kept yelling. I asked her to not do that and tried talking. It didn't;t work. I tried again. It didn't work. I said this conversation is being put on hold then and she said no. She blocked the front door and wouldn't let me leave. I got angry and threw a small basket holding keys. She got made and grabbed me. I tried walking away and going to a separate room and she she grabbed me around the neck with both hands, it felt like she was strangling me. I told her to get off me and lost it. I slammed a door and was sitting against it and she kept kicking until she got in and then grabbed me by the hair. I was sobbing and telling her to just leave me alone, to please leave me alone. She then proceeded to threaten me by saying that she was going to call my graduate program (Im in a doctoral program) and get me kicked out. those were her words. I'm at a loss.

I have slept in our guest room on an air mattress now for a week, haven't talked to her, and eaten every shitty food item I can think of. I cried nonstop for the first 4 days, and am mixed with anger, sadness, frustration, and hopelessness. I love this women but I don't know if she will ever change. I feel like she crossed over a line. I can barely look at her without getting upset, and I don't trust her now. I try so hard to show her I love her, but it just doesn't feel like I can do anything to help. She knows how much she hurts me when cuts me off, but does it anyway.

She has apologized and said how wrong it is, but this has happened numerous times now. It feels like it has escalated and now it has hit unprecedented levels. Im crying just writing this.

Please, help me.

I found out today that on Monday, the person who had bailed my husband out of jail was a girl he met off a dating app, and he tried to make it seem like I was the psychotic one to them so the girl would go get him. He had sex with her and said he wanted to have a baby by her and forced her to delete the dating app they met on and then forced her to post a picture of him on her Facebook. Ridiculous. He said he wanted to impregnate her so bad, he came inside her. These are all her words. I'm not even shocked, because I found out he's been cheating with multiple women through his Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts that I didn't even know existed. The girl didn't want to believe he was a married man and insisted that maybe I was lying but I showed her every message he's ever sent me and how he attempted to kill himself, plus videos and pictures on his gallery of him having sex with multiple other women while he lied about where he was to me.

She said it had been the first time they met, and it was because she bailed him out of jail.

...

This morning he tried to kill himself.

At one point while we were still living together, he went and changed my Snapchat password and put Snapchat as Spam mail on my Gmail, so I could never see if someone else logged in. Well, I woke up at 4am because my daughter was hungry, and to stay awake, I hopped on snap just to find that it was logged out. I tried my password and it kept saying it was wrong.

I reset it immediately and logged in, my husband had added himself and had screenshotted OLD conversations, conversations I had with people YEARS ago, WAYYYY before we were even married. Not only that, he saw a message I sent to a gay friend telling him my whereabouts and asking him to visit because I wanted to have someone to drink with and talk to.

So now began the accusations from his part -- he began to say I was having an affair and that I never loved him and that he knew where I was at (I have a protection order, and since I'm military, he's barred from post and I'm staying safely within base, but he was never supposed to know that).

He started telling me I never loved him and that he was going to kill himself. He started sending a lot of videos that I refused to open. So he saved them and sent them directly to me, he was downing a full bottle of sleeping pills.

I called the police for a welfare check and told them the videos were from MY bedroom.

They went, he refused to open the door, then they forced themselves in because they had clear evidence that he was trying to commit suicide based off the videos he sent me, and they took him to the ER.

He's now in the ICU and has been stable but not exactly conscious. I hate how they told me since I'm his spouse, I have to be the only one to call and ask for updates. I'm super pissed. I want it to be his brother or sister, I want nothing to do with him and want nothing from him, but since he's not conscious, he can't say otherwise and his family keeps contacting me asking for updates.

I fucking hate this guy. Would it be heartless or fucked up to say I wish I hadn't called the cops? That I wish he had died? I'm not sorry anymore, I went through hell this week just to find out he has cheated so many more times because of his suicide attempt. I fucking hate him! He's the father of my child and yet he beat me so many times because he didn't want me to find out or say someone else would treat me better.

I am void of emotion. I feel nothing.

my partner and I are very hot and cold. and I find myself feeling irrationally guilty for the abuse happening to me. like for example, we were arguing the other day, he insulted my mental health and my looks, and I fired back saying that his d*ck is small and that's why he can't act right. it was unnecessary that I fire back, but I was hurt and angry. he constantly makes me feel ashamed of my body physically, so I did the same. he punched me in the face. definitely not the first time. 

but the thing is. I am fully aware that yeah I shouldn't fire back, but that no matter what I said he shouldn't physically touch me. but I ALWAYS after these situations feel guilt as though if I didn't say something he wouldn't do it. even though he would have found a reason to hit me if I was sitting there quietly AGREEING with his statements about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I just moved into a new apartment and the first month was fine, but in the past 2 weeks I am beginning to suspect the neighbor below me  is abusive. The first time it was a screaming match between two guys for what seemed like 5 minutes. Im unsure how long it actually occurred because it was as I was walking back into my apartment. I heard them pushing (definitely knocked over something), but i didnt hear any actual hits. By the time I got out my phone to call someone, the fight was over.

Just now I heard another altercation. The same man from the previous time screaming ""stop calling me a thief"" ""shit the fu$k up"" etc... Right before it stopped, i could hear the guy yell to sit down, then i a wife/gf say calm down... then heard the guy again and a push or something. This was only about a minute or 2.

Ive been hoping to catch the woman on her way out since the first occurrence, but I havent been lucky. I want to ask if everything is ok before I call the police (if this happens again.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone here can share a good approach to how to handle this. I am going to notify the landlord and I have the Sheriff number in my contacts if it escalates again. Im concerned Ill call, it will subside by the time they get here, and it might get worse for the family.

domesticviolence,"I never really got the chance to talk out what happened so I thought I‚Äôd just get it all out here. I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl and the guy that I was dealing with was 22.  I met him on Facebook messenger after he messaged me and he genuinely seemed like a nice guy.  

After us talking for a few days he brought up the subject of possibility meeting up and I agreed. As we talked about meeting up, I found it weird that he wanted to meet at his house after dark but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I genuinely wanted to meet him and I would need to sneak out to do it because I still live with my mother and she‚Äôs really protective of me because of my mental health issues. I met up with him and and everything was fine but it seems like shortly after our meet up I noticed that he would start to say things like 

‚ÄúWhy are you acting so stupid?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy are you still up?, you better be at home.‚Äù

But at the time I overlooked those red flags thinking that he liked me and just was just being possessive.  Another red flag that I missed was him wanting to move the relationship much faster than a normal relationship. He started telling me that he loved me and I would voice that I was uncomfortable with him saying that so early in the relationship ( I don‚Äôt really remember how he responded to that). 

Even with all of that, I still fell in love with him and soon I was spending every other night at his home. While I was there, I began to notice how him and his family drank every night. I tried to get him to stop but he refused. One night I was staying over and I decided that I would take a nap when I got there and I woke up at like 2 in the morning  and I remember that I got up to use the restroom and he called me into the kitchen after and he was drinking a tall can of Green apple fourl loko and he seemed normal. He made me something to eat and we smoked(marijuana) together and I said that I wanted to go back into his room. When we got into his room he turned on the tv and he was still drinking the four loko. 

Something on the tv make me laugh and all of a sudden he started being mean to me, asking me why I was laughing at that( the joke) and I said it was because I thought it was funny and he just dropped it. Once the show went off, he started searching for something else and I asked if we could watch Problem Child and that‚Äôs when he really started being mean to me so I just turned over and looked for something to to watch on YouTube as I often did and that‚Äôs when he came and towered over me( I was laying down and he was standing ) and he started asking me why I was on my phone and I told him that it was because I can and he was like‚Äùwhat?‚Äù( I guess to intimidate me) and when I said it again he punched me really hard and really fast too. 

I almost didn‚Äôt even know what happened. My nose was bleeding a little and I jumped up immediately and started crying and begging him to just let me go home and it was like he didn‚Äôt care that I was crying at all.  He said ‚Äú I really don‚Äôt wanna hit you again, lay down.‚Äù And I did but after a few minutes, I sat up and with my legs dangling off the bed  with my hand covering my face and he said to me

‚Äú why the the fuck are you sitting there looking stupid, lay your ass down.‚Äù 

I was so scared. I just did what he said. After he went to sleep, I went to the bathroom just incase he was really awake waiting for me to try to leave and when he didn‚Äôt come after me I slipped out of the front door, leaving my overnight bag and only taking my phone. I immediately called my mother and told her what had happened and she said that she was coming to get me. I ended up waiting in one of his neighbors yards until she came. After that situation happened I did go back to him because I was I started to miss him but that‚Äôs all I wanna share for now",Just got out of an abusive relationship &amp; still struggling to make sense of it all.,ThewitchDoctor20,2020-01-15 16:12:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ep4983/just_got_out_of_an_abusive_relationship_still/,4,0.94,13,16,783

domesticviolence,"He did it multiple times. Powered over me. Made me afraid of telling anyone. He said no one would believe me. He made me buy makeup to cover it. He made me cough up blood from the painful stomping on my ribs. He would stuff my throat with whatever he could find so I wouldn't scream in pain and instead choke on my own saliva and mucus that clogged my nose from crying. He would punch me and say I triggered him and tell me he felt no remorse.

""Are you going to stop being stupid now?""

""Shut the fuck up,""

""You deserve this for acting up.""

This was the last one.

It wasn't nearly as bad as the previous ones.

He almost killed me July 4th, 2018. He strangled me, dragged me from my hair across the house, punched me, suffocated me with pillows when I wouldn't stop crying... He did it because I wouldn't stay to have another beer with his friends and wanted to go home early. He wasn't even drunk. Just full of rage that I wasn't willing to stay.

He said he regretted it in the morning, yet if I tried to run, he would do it all over again but it would just get worse. I was so afraid of him. He was in control...He forced himself on me because I was afraid of saying no. I wanted the loving husband I thought I had to hold me and love me, but it wasn't love, just rape. I see that now. I felt only the pain of my bruises while he had sex with my tired and aching body.

I conceived my daughter that way. Yet he denied it was his.

November 13th 2018. I'm 20 weeks pregnant. He's suspiciously texting at 12am. I wake up at 2am for a snack and notice he's left his phone unlocked. There's a girl. And another. He's sending them pictures I took of him, and he's single in their eyes. I don't say anything. I take screenshots, send them to myself, and try to leave as quietly as possible. He wakes up and follows me. I try to make an excuse but I know I can't shake him off now. He drags me inside and tries to choke me.

He beat me and tried to suffocate me again. I cried. He hit my stomach. Trauma to the placenta. I escaped after 9 grueling hours of horror, of pain... The doctors think I'm going to miscarry. My black eyes visible. I'm scared. I'm alone. I'm afraid. I have a baby in me from a man I didn't want to be with anymore.


...


A year later, we rekindle whatever ""love"" we had. I let him come into my home so he could meet our daughter. He said he's a changed man. I saw it, he treated our daughter so well. He loved her a lot! He loved me, he said.

Wrong.

He beat me because I told him once while we argued that other men have treated me better. He punched me while he held our daughter, I stayed quiet, I was shocked. Yet he consciously put our daughter down on the bed just to continue to beat me. That's when he stomped on my ribs and face. I was disfigured from the bruising and swelling, I didn't recognize myself. I vomitted blood. I wanted to die. This was before Christmas 2019. One month into our time together, he beat me again. I couldn't say anything. He was my babysitter while I worked and I didn't want to lose the family I had.

He beat me again on Christmas. He was mad because I told him that if he were to cheat again, I'd leave him. ""Say something stupid again,"" he said while he pulled my hair off and bashed my face into the floor. I still didn't say anything. He demeaned me in every which way possible with words.

He promised me a new year on our anniversary on the 1st of January. Proposed to me all over again. 

Something went wrong.

He started forcing me to have sex with him every night. I'd wake up to him already having sex with me while I was asleep. Sometimes I'd just walk away and he'd grab me and force me to give him head. He forcibly inserted his penis in my anus and made me scream in horrifying pain once. He said he liked how I got the first time we did anal in years so he wanted it again. He liked seeing me in pain and beneath him.

He also started checking my phone daily while I slept to see if I was talking to another man. He went through all of my contacts, opened every message, Snapchat messages, Gmail's, opened old accounts. Screenshot things and sent them to himself. Every man was suddenly a threat to him. He turned on my location to try and see my whereabouts and didn't tell me. His insecurity rose. I wasn't doing anything wrong though.

January 12th, 2020. I found out it's because he thought I could potentially have been doing what he had already begun doing. Started texting multiple women he met through dating apps and claiming he was a divorced man. Nobody knew he was living with me. I was upset. I tried leaving again, this time with my daughter in my arms. He grabbed me, and when I said I wouldn't do it again, I pushed him away in an attempt to defend myself and he overpowered me, threw me on the ground, open-handedly slapped me as hard as he could until I saw nothing but white and became dizzy. He dragged me by my hair and continuously punched me even when he tossed me in bed. I could hear my 9 month old daughter screaming. She was scared, too. I could hear it. The horror in my baby's cry.

I slept for two hours after that. I had unintentionally passed out.

He took off with my cell phone and my car. A neighbor saw me in distress and called the police. They arrived and took me to the hospital. They caught him driving with no license and a stolen vehicle. He was arrested subsequently.

He begged me to help him get released on bond. He begged me and said he loved me and regretted everything. He said he didn't want to lose us, the little family we had. I denied. Someone else released him on bond.

I'm afraid for my life, I know he's going to kill me. He already let me know that my life is worthless and meaningless to him.

No more. NO. MORE.

To anyone who's read this far, thank you for reading. The purpose of this post is for me to keep accountability of myself and of the things I've gone through so far, and share my story with anyone who's interested. I've been living in fear and currently am. I'm being relocated soon. I have begun filing for divorce and have a protective order. I'm ready to start my life over again. I've been walking around with a black eye as a constant reminder that I am a victim of domestic violence and don't want to become another statistic. People ask questions, many don't, and others have built up anger and hatred towards my spouse they've never met just by looking at me.

One day I'll stop shaking in fear when I remember his face and see his name. Uttering it has become difficult. I still have his last name. I don't want it anymore. I wish my daughter didn't have it either.

I'll be a stronger woman soon. I know I was strong enough to say enough is enough. My daughter deserves better and should never have to witness horror like this. She means the world to me and reminded me that my life is meaningful, my life is worth something, I have given her life and I will nurture her so she can grow and be a better version of me. Her father will never see it, and one day I'll tell her why.

For now, I'll take everything day by day.

He called me a bitch, and told me I‚Äôm stupid etc. I told him please stop, but he always called me soft. And eventually would apologize. I thought this as a normal thing. Things escalated a few days ago I found messages with him and another women. He pleaded with me and I wanted to get back with him but he just wouldn‚Äôt tell me the whole truth. He took his gun out and said if you want to end it then go ahead, and gave it to me to shoot him. I said please stop you are scaring me let's have a serious discussion.

He did this several times each time more and more scary. I thought I was about to die when he was choking me. But I blame myself. I was high on my emotions in shock and I wanted his passcode. He wouldn‚Äôt give it to me and tried to blame me because I looked through his phone. I always pretend my life is perfect so I didn‚Äôt want this to be the case. The day after that I didn‚Äôt talk to him we broke up but he was talking to me like he wanted to still be with me. He apologized and said he would always love me and that he hopes I can find some way to forgive him. Today I talked to a guy on a dating app about meeting up and he was in bed next to me. He slapped the  phone out of my hand and grabbed my wrist and hung up the phone. He said I‚Äôm not shit. But he said we are done 1000 times. I ended up finding the girls number and confronted her, she ended up being a prostitute. When he got home I confronted him. He pushed me and called me a stupid bitch. I spit in his face. He spit in mine. Several times this went on for an hour. Eventually he got his penis out and started peeing on me. He said i am his and that he's marking his territory. I pulled his hair he tackled me and started strangling me. I really thought this was the end. Like wow i‚Äôm going to die like this. He stopped only when I scream with whatever breath I have left or pushed him off of me. I really thought I was gonna die.  He did this several times. I think im in denial. I didn't think I would be a victim of domestic violence. He has said many times he would never hit a women. I'm too scared to tell anyone. We have a roommate and I told him we broke up and im thinking of telling him about this but I feel like he likes my ex more than me. I can't tell anyone right now.

We have been together for only 5 months, 4 of which he lives here with his children in my house. Long story short, he was being evicted and I felt bad and let him stay here. I guess he‚Äôs been gaslighting me the whole time He has no job or car and is living off social security. Yes that should have been a red flag but I felt bad as he was down on his luck and had some crappy stuff happen to him I basically for the most part have been supporting him and his kids with food and shelter He took care of his own kids, cleaned up after himself and did pay me back some but not even close to what I spent.

He would flip out over minor really weird things like I knocked his kids Cup down by mistake and tell me I‚Äôm a self absorbed bitch We have gotten into four major fights all with screaming and him telling me he hates me and I was the worst mistake of his life. He would say I treat him like he‚Äôs nothing even though I have done everything for him. Said I‚Äôm stupid. He‚Äôs smarter than me. He‚Äôs a man and he‚Äôs superior in the relationship. More than once he‚Äôs threatened to kill me. He said if I throw him and his kids out he will kill me and my whole family and hunt us all down until we are dead. He‚Äôs ex military and would say he is calling his army ranger buddies. He was going get a gun. Knock my teeth out cave my face in but he won‚Äôt cause his kids. And I had to see a therapist to make us work because of my insecurities issues and I project on him

Friday escalated and he told me to leave him alone after I said good morning. When I tried to talk to him he said he was getting a gun to shut me up Then later I asked for 200 he owes me and he said he is going knock my teeth out Sat morning I told him he needed to leave because he kept threatening me and he said make me cunt so I said I was calling the cops He said go ahead no one will believe you over me your unstable and have mental issues I said you have rage issues and your kids shouldn‚Äôt be around you like this you need help and then he started screaming what the fuck did you say and chases me up the stairs and threw me in the ground and was screaming in my face that if his kids get taken away he will kill me and my whole family. Do you understand I will kill you I got up and said get away from me you need to leave and he threw me in the wall and started screaming again. I started screaming help and he strayed screaming she‚Äôs stabbing me an me actually got a knife and cut himself I called the police and at first I didn‚Äôt get a restraining order.

domesticviolence,"RKelly Documentary creates memory flashback

I just finished watching the documentary on RKelly. I must say this show has opened up a flood gate of memories that I have been trying to keep closed for years.

 I see me sitting on the floor in the bathroom crying. I am sitting there thinking to myself ‚Äúif only I would have never said anything about looking at his phone. Why did I have to tell him that I saw his conversation with that girl? Why am I so stupid? I ruined this all. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù I would say to him, ‚ÄúI messed up. I won‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù

 He wouldn‚Äôt look at me. No eye contact. Not an ounce of remorse. I would still beg and plead and apologize. He would leave. Leave me there at his house alone. And still I would stay. I would stay and wait for him to get home. Never to speak about this again. We would move on. 

Another day. 

Another fight. 

‚ÄúWho are you texting? Why are you friends with her?‚Äù He would say. He convinced me my friends were no good for me. ‚ÄúThey are using you, they are never there when you need them. They only want to see you when it‚Äôs convenient for them.‚Äù I was convinced. I don‚Äôt need these friends. He is there for me, he is there when I need him.

Until he wasn‚Äôt.

 I haven‚Äôt heard from him in days. But we were supposed to be together? He supposed to be my best friend. I have no one else to talk to cause I stopped connecting with everyone else. Then there‚Äôs a knock. 

It‚Äôs him.

It‚Äôs 3 am and he smells like booze. I let him in. Not even thinking of what my mother would think. I don‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs my best friend. He tries to take my clothes off. I say no. He says he misses me. I ask why he hasn‚Äôt called. He ignores the question and keeps trying to take my shirt off. I pull away. He grabs me. He says he is sorry. I say that‚Äôs not good enough. I ask for an explanation. He doesn‚Äôt have one. I question him about his night. His answers are vague. 

He tells me he loves me. I believe him. 

I say I still don‚Äôt want to have sex. He doesn‚Äôt listen. I cave. He tries again and I don‚Äôt stop him.

After the last attack on October last year, when he decided to injure and stalk me at work, ive reported him and applied for a restraining order. I was contacted today by the cops that they're trying to get hold of him and inform him of my restraining order against him. I hope I get it soon, I don't want to change jobs again or even change my name to get away from this person. I gave the cops the address to his work. I feel rather happy that they show up at his work warning him to back off. 

I felt relief and happy that there's finally a light under the tunnel. It's at least a step 

Back story : last year my ex attacked me. He injured me and I ended up with concussion, fractured ribs and psychical problems. Case was closed due to lack of evidence.

domesticviolence,"Hello everyone,

I would like some advice on a situation.
I (33) think my mother (in her 60's) might be in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend. Telling the whole story would be very long, but the major red flag was yesterday.

She called me because she needed help to set up a new email adress, and how to privately check her mails. When I asked her why, she told me it was because she had been seing a lawyer to legally adopt my eldest sister (her mom died giving birth and when my mom met my father, she raised her like her own. My father passed away a few years ago and we all decided it would be best if my mom adopted my sister)

But she does not want to tell her boyfriend about it, and because he's the one checking her emails and doing her ""paperwork"" she needed it to be private.
I don't know why she feels the need to keep it secret but I have a feeling it's because her BF thinks she should not do it. While he clearly has zero opinion to give in that matter. 

So obviously I told her how to do all that, how to use a private browser etc. I did not asked any more questions because I was a bit in shock.

This is not the first time she hides stuff from him. Last month she got a parking ticket while visiting me and asked me not to tell him when I'll visit for Christmas because ""he'll make a big deal of it"" . There also plenty of little things that would be too long to write but from what I've seen, this guy is quite controling and intrusive (at Christmas he told me had had looked for me online and regularly checks my website. I'm a lingerie designer and if there is nothing wrong with being genuinely interested in what I do I still found that really creepy) 

They met 2 years after my father died and moved in together (in my mother's house) last year after 3 or 4 years of their relationship.
My mom is a very anxious person in general but it seems to be worse than ever. I don't know why she feels like she has to keep secrets from him, but I'm worried it's because she's afraid of his reaction. I also know that she is extremely affraid to be alone and will accept to be treated like shit for not being alone. She says she likes the fact that he's controling - he just wants what's best for her, he knows better, he's better than her with papers, he just wants to help, etc. He basically treats her like a child, except when it comes to cooking and cleaning, then that's her job. 

I don't know what to do. Their relationship is clearly not making her happy despite what she says but at the same time, who am I to judge? She's an adult capable of making her own decisions, and I feel like if I tell her about what I think she won't ask for help anymore. That already happened with my sister. But I also don't want to do nothing because it's getting creepier and creepier and I don't want to wait till she's in an even worse situation. 
I live 500km from her, she has very little friends. She's not seing some of them anymore because they did not get along with her boyfriend and the one or two left, she sees them maybe once every 6 months. My grandmother, aunt and cousin are the only people she still sees and they think this guy is a god because... he's a guy. My grandmother recently told me that she thinks a good spouse should always be a little scared of her husband. So I seriously doubt they can see how problematic he is and they will probably encourage my mom to stay with him no matter what because in their mind, being in a relationship - for a woman-is the most important thing.

I decided I'll call my mom tomorrow to ask her more about all of this - but I don't know how to do it without her feeling like I'm judging her. I have zero tolerance for the kind of behavior this guy had and to be honest I'm afraid I'll end up getting angry and telling her her bf is a jerk and she should dump him - wich I know won't help at all.

domesticviolence,"Long story short, my wife (F26) and I (M27) have been married for a few years. At first she abused me verbally and physically (never enough to leave a bruise or anything, but she would throw things at me, hit me in the back of the head, etc...). When begging for forgiveness didn't work I started hitting her back. Her parents know, our pastor knows, and there's a police record of the cops getting called on us for screaming at each other -- though nothing came of that because I had already left the house at that point.

After intensive counseling I have stopped abusing her (though she would say I still mentally abuse her by playing mind games... My side of the story is just that I'm walking on eggshells trying not to say the wrong thing). But she continued. The last couple weeks have been especially bad. She's called me retard, idiot, worthless, told me she wishes I was dead, told me she wishes she was dead, punched me, and thrown things at me. 

I'm ready to leave. But I'm scared. I could see her hitting me hard enough to leave a bruise, in which case I'd call the cops. But she always has random bruises from running into doors and stuff. Given that, and our history of abusing each other she could easily just tell the cops that she was defending herself. What happens in that situation? I hear horror stories of guys getting taken to jail for the night and stuff like that. I can't loose my job or worse.

There's also the wrinkle of us both having been hospitalized for alcohol use in the past - so she could say I was drunk. And we both smoke weed from time to time, so she could tell the cops -- or even if the cops aren't involved, she could just try to get me in trouble at work or something.

But I guess my biggest question is just what happens when the cops come and she says she was defending herself? What happens if the cops come and she tries to get me in trouble for drugs or something? What happens if the cops come while I'm high???

I'm in Southern Ohio if it makes a difference. 

Telling me to get out of there now and such isn't going to help because I'm not leaving tonight. I'm probably not leaving tomorrow. And I'm probably not leaving next week.

domesticviolence,"
Long post ahead warning 

So to start, my sister (23F) and I (27F) have always been close, especially as adults. Prior to the start of her current relationship, we spoke every day, talked about everything under the sun, visited each other frequently, etc...you get the picture. 

On to the problem: my sister started dating her boyfriend (24M) about a year and a half ago. They met at a work event and were doing long distance for the first year of the relationship. My sister drove 4+ hours multiple times a month to go visit him, and he would come visit her as well. Eventually they relocated together to a city about two hours away from me. 

Since they started dating there have been red flags starting from the beginning. Firstly, my sister started lying and ditching her friends and family to go see him while they were long distance. Last year, my friend had a birthday weekend out of town and I invited my sister. She insisted her boyfriend come (even though he had barely met me and had never met my friend) and I gave in and said he could. They met us out late, stayed for one drink, her boyfriend was incredibly rude to me and my friend, and then picked a fight with my sister and they left. A few months later, he broke up with her and called her every awful name in the book. She called me sobbing but said she felt relieved because ‚Äúher boyfriend controlled everything she did.‚Äù She said she truly felt relieved and couldn‚Äôt wait to do all the stuff he wouldn‚Äôt let her do before. A few days later, he calls her and they talk for a few hours and suddenly the whole story is different. That it was all her fault, she had made up the whole thing, he treats her so well, etc etc. This just made me and my parents even more wary of this guy. 

Over the course of the months since their ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù my sister has refused all offers to come visit me or for me to come visit her. If we do make plans, she cancels or comes up with some excuse why it won‚Äôt work. She won‚Äôt answer texts or phone calls from anyone in the family when they are together. She has no friends other than him in the new city they are living in. They never go out and do anything fun really...all he wants to do is stay at home and smoke weed and play video games. During the times we‚Äôve all been together, her boyfriend is standoffish and seems annoyed. At Thanksgiving (that was held at their house), he did not get up or offer to help one single time the whole time we were there. Over Christmas, he showed up late to our Christmas morning because ‚Äúhe forgot to set an alarm‚Äù but left the first chance he could because he couldn‚Äôt miss his family‚Äôs Christmas. My sister told me over Christmas that she‚Äôs getting tired of having to always pick up after him and ask him to help out around the house but she said that‚Äôs just how he was and was scared to bring it up to him because when they fight he screams and curses at her and/or brings up all the old stuff she‚Äôs ever done wrong. I told her that was not okay and not normal but at this point she‚Äôs not willing to listen. 

The final straw was last night. I have an opportunity in the city they live in that is amazing! I talked to my sister two weeks ago about hopefully being able to sleep in their guest room two nights a week for 3 months and she said yes. Yesterday I called to confirm and she said that it wasn‚Äôt going to work out. When I asked why she stated that ‚Äúthey were having relationship problems and it doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea.‚Äù She had no concrete answer just that it wasn‚Äôt going to work. I know this is because her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like the idea. She sounded upset and was crying. 

I am seriously concerned and worried about her well being. I feel like he is distancing her from all the people that love her.

domesticviolence,"My ex and I dated for over 5 years, from the ages of 17-22. Although he never physically hurt me, he was emotionally/mentally abusive and showed signs of physical aggression on occasion like punching inanimate objects, yelling, grabbing me, etc. I feared for his and others‚Äô safety occasionally as well. He lacked empathy, was quick to anger, was jealous and controlling, called me names, and manipulated me. The scary part was that he hid these negative traits from everyone but me and his family; at work, school or with friends he was charming, hardworking, and well-liked. 

Now, he‚Äôs messaged me after 4 years of no contact to ask me to serve as a reference for his application to a police department, as required by the department. He asked for my information and sent me a screenshot of his application, so I know he isn‚Äôt lying. The application asked for all previous significant others info and if there were restraining or protective orders.  As you can imagine, this is someone that I believe shouldn‚Äôt have a job where he is in power over others or possess a firearm. I‚Äôm scared that he is going to  hurt someone. It‚Äôs worth noting that we dated when we were young, and I know people can grow and change...maybe he has. And the abuse wasn‚Äôt as extreme as other people‚Äôs stories that I‚Äôve heard and we never lived together or shared finances. I don‚Äôt want to look like a bitter ex trying to ruin his chance at a career, because it‚Äôs not like that at all. 

He said the department should contact me, but it‚Äôs been 2 months so I don‚Äôt think they will. Should I say something anonymously to the police department where he is applied? Is it my responsibility? Obviously if they call me to use as a reference I will answer their questions honestly.

The people who know where she lives have all been asked to be very careful not to tell father where she is now, but someones let slip. We don't know what to do about it. He isn't a physical danger to mother but he is perfectly capable of harassing and stalking her and causing issues with the neighbours, especially when drunk.

domesticviolence,"I'm not speaking with my abusive partner for about two weeks since he hit me last time. It's the only way of keeping things under somewhat of control. My voice is a trigger for him so I'm just silent. He doesn't bother with how I'm feeling and how it affects kids. I'm sad inside and frustrated but it's okay when he goes out.

Today a day was a bit odd. He seemed more psycho than usual. In the way he walks. In the way he slept more and open his beer three hours earlier. It all got clear when I overheard conversation of him with his mother who is has a bad health. He's very sensitive but I have a sense he's also enjoying a role where he can gets a sympathy from others. He is concerned about her mother but can't wait to see her knocked down. Why I say so? Because he treats her as shit when she's okay.

He got out to be with her in emergency room I suppose. I have no idea because he's not telling me anything. I cooked a meal, nobody wants to eat it. I had to use grocceries because it would rot otherwise. He was keeping it for two days prepared and not doing anything with it. 

Finally he came home and first thing he shoot is ugly insult although I had been jumping around kids for three hours, who are everywhere. His words stab me right in the middle of my consiousness. I say nothing but it hurts. I can rationalize all I want the fact he's releasing his own hurt onto me because he can. Because I serve as a sponge for his emotions he has trouble to deal with. And there I go mad. I went to the day room and sit and mind my own business but it's cooking inside. 

My oldest daughter seems short on some moments when she is bored. I can repeat her ten times to stop pulling her brother, who has a bad balance, by his t-shirt, she just puts instead a stupid smile and keeps on doing this. Plus she calls her dad now in ugly names, which he handles well for most part of the time, but not always. So, I told her to stop pulling him from behind, and then I snaped, I grabed her rough, she hits herself on a fence, and few moments later she jumps again on a bed and annoys me, and I grab her again to put down and threat her with words ""i'll take your head off"" and it's a whole amount of rage in me and dissapointment because I handled them all day well, and I was good to them and to her, and here I am, sad and angry, but not because of them but because of their father to whom I can't say or explain a thing. 

Here he comes in and tries to act as a mediator as someone who understands that I had been tired of kids so he acts in a calm and peaceful way... and it makes me even more furious because it's not kids who were difficult for me, and it's not them why I snaped. It was him only and his sickening psycho war he's playing the whole time. I hate him so much now and want to hurt him but he is using his own hurt experience to build walls like a pro in this hurt game. The guy is so incredible he even saved his own old shoes in a closet and wears his new shoes I bought, with which he punched me already several times, in a hope I suppose, that I would throw his shoes and he would take back his old shoes like an offended child, and it would mean he won because he wants to prove himself that he doesn't get any act od kidness ever and that he's rightfully acting hurt all the fucking time.

At the same time it has made me talk about a lot of things I buried deep down about my past relationship and all the memories I locked in a closed box in the back of my brain that I've been trying so hard to forget and not think about. I was doing an okay job at pretending things never happened/not realizing the extent of how bad it really was. I still thought I was at fault for all the things that happened/all the things he did to me. 

My new partner has shown me otherwise. At the same time I've had to now face everything that really happened to me, and there are still things I can't quite come out to talk to my partner about, I just dont feel ready or strong enough.

domesticviolence,"Me and my boyfriend have been together since May of 2019. He is 21 and I am 18. I am a female. 

The other day we got into an argument over something stupid and it quickly escalated. He ended up calling me a stupid bitch, cunt, and other nasty names. I got really mad and began to hit him. I am a pretty skinny girl, not super strong, though I am the same height as him. (I am 5‚Äô8, 135 Ib) I hit him in the arm a couple times, trying to hit his face, until he took me down. He put both hands on my neck and began to choke me. There is a little bruise on the front of my neck that looks like a hickey. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I understand why he did this, I did throw a few punches and landed about 4 I think. I love him and I do think he loves me too. He‚Äôs never choked me before, I‚Äôm so hurt and confused. I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all, he was forcefully cutting off my air flow for probably a little under 10 seconds. He stopped when I barely was able to loosen his grip enough to faintly say ‚Äústop it I love you.‚Äù 

I feel horrible for hitting him, but I personally feel like it‚Äôs a bad sign that he choked me...  I would‚Äôve definitely expected him to call the cops or restrain me but I did hit him so I can‚Äôt be mad. He told me that I brought it out of him.

Posting again because no matter how apologetic they are, they will not treat you better. 

On Christmas he said I‚Äôd better run faster than I did before because he‚Äôd actually try to catch up this time to stomp out my neck. 

Update: I always lived separate from him so my cats are safe with me. As much as he wanted me to move in with him, so he could save money, I always knew I should keep myself independent in that way. 

I‚Äôve blocked him on all social media platforms he uses and have my second counseling appointment on Friday. He has not contacted me through email for a week now. 

It has been thirteen days since I left for good. I feel really nice. 
.
.
.

I got away.

It‚Äôs been two and a half years in the same relationship. At first it was not bad. 

It was exciting. New. 

Different than anything I‚Äôd felt before. 

It was so nice. Until it wasn‚Äôt. 

Eight months in is when the anger started to show. It was just one backhand to the face; although, it did feel like a punch. I said I was done. 

I lied to myself. 

The relationship kept going. It didn‚Äôt help that we worked together and I got promoted before him. He blamed it on racial discrimination because I was white and he was Mexican. This became the new theme of every argument. Soon it was just any conversation. 

One time he was out with another manager and I texted them for a question and I got a call a minute later about how I‚Äôm a slut and how he is going to go have sex with a bunch of girls. Still, I was distraught and thought I loved him. 

I called him fifty times. 

He finally answered and when he did he said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre at the apartment when I get there just know you need to be ready.‚Äù I certainly didn‚Äôt take his words to heart and ended up staying. 

He was drunk so I don‚Äôt think he realized how hard he was hitting me. I remember repeatedly being slapped in the face about twenty times and then there were times he would stomp on my leg extremely hard. 

The next day when I told him he hit me so hard he told me, ‚ÄúYou really want to test me and think that was my hardest?‚Äù 

I just wanted to tell him I was in pain. Not that I wanted more. 

He always told me what to do and that was a constant from the beginning. 

If he needed food? I was there. 

When he didn‚Äôt have a car and needed rides? I was there. 

His laundry needed to be done? I had that. 

Even when I did those things, none of them were good enough. 

If I got food and forgot something, I was stupid and ruined everything. 

If I wasn‚Äôt available to give him a ride, I was selfish and lazy. 

If his clothes weren‚Äôt washed the right way, I was privileged and didn‚Äôt know how to clean anything. 

Red flags. Red flags. Red flags. 

I know. 

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt she just leave?‚Äù I wish I did it sooner. 

The tricky thing about manipulation is it‚Äôs hard to see from the outside looking in. Nobody knew and if they did, it would be too awkward for them to discuss. 

Yes, he treated me this way - but he also broke down in my arms in tears before. 

I‚Äôve always been empathetic and with that character trait I‚Äôve always been susceptible to peoples‚Äô narcissistic behaviors. 

It had been a little over a year now. I can‚Äôt remember every argument but they all included their own brand of pain. 

The names he would call me were endless: ugly, stupid, cunt, retard, racist, dumb, bitch. Whenever I would try to cook for him, he would say it was horrible and dry. 

We never lived together and I was constantly shuffling back and forth between our apartments. Me, my gas, and my bank account were exhausted. 

I would put him and his daughter eating before me. Sometimes he would even say I couldn‚Äôt eat for a period of time until he said it was okay. 

I‚Äôve lost so much healthy fat that I‚Äôve been at 15% body fat as a women without purposely trying to train for a fitness competition - I know that‚Äôs not healthy.

I would let my hair get knotted up to the point where it would take me over fifteen minutes to brush my hair. 
My hair is so thin now I fear I‚Äôm just going to keep losing more.

The abuse continued. I‚Äôd have to get on my knees to be forgiven and he even made me use them to get across the tile floor when I would make him upset. My tears would only enrage him. There was no sympathy from him. I did not deserve it because I was so privileged from being white and a female. 

End of July 2019 is where things got very bad. 

He found texts on my phone with an old manager and accused me of being a skank and ‚Äúputting them before him‚Äù even though I would do anything I could for him. 

The texts were just me trying to show my ideas. I‚Äôm a very passionate person and over share my ideas until people are absolutely annoyed with it. 

I had to demote myself the next day. 

We would take day vacations to go hiking in Utah and he would ‚Äújoke‚Äù about me not coming back from the trips. 

He would be so angry after each trip. 

Nothing made him happy unless I was suffering. 

My job demoted me further because, ‚ÄúI was becoming a long term problem.‚Äù Even being demoted wasn‚Äôt enough and a week ago I had to quit. 

One night I picked him up from a wedding and he was saying things in the car that were upsetting me. I swerved the car slightly like I was going to crash us and he took it as me trying to kill him. 

As I was driving on the freeway he was choking me until my eyesight was going black. I still don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt crash. He made me get in the passenger seat. 

He was driving 90 mph drunk on the freeway. He was yelling at me to jump out of the car. He said if I didn‚Äôt jump out he would kill me anyways. My face was pretty messed up at this point.  

He kept saying that this would be my last night on earth and I‚Äôd be going to hell soon. 

By the grace of some higher power, his parents happened to be home. So we didn‚Äôt drive all the way up to his house. 

He was staring at me with his crazy eyes saying he‚Äôs not afraid to do it and I somehow was able to run out of my car and ran to a 7/11. 

When the police came I lied about what happened so his daughter wouldn‚Äôt be taken away from him. I should have just told them. 

My sister picked me up and I swore I was done. 

I got his remaining stuff from my apartment and drove them to him the next day. 

I went back to him. 

Back to a guy who said he would kill me. 

I don‚Äôt know if I even cared about my morality at this point. This was the routine and I was used to the abuse. How can one be comfortable in an environment filled with abuse? I still don‚Äôt know. 

A month passed since that happened and the abuse didn‚Äôt stop. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as that night but things certainly were not good. 

I was depressed and angry with myself. 

I would have to put on a fake smile all the time and he even started to catch on and told me to, ‚ÄúJust have a normal face!‚Äù

I did not know how to have a normal face anymore. 
It was just a blank stare. 

Two days ago he found out I helped an old boyfriend, from ten years ago, get hired at our job. He had just had a kid and needed help finding good income. All I did was help him get an interview. I didn‚Äôt even think the hiring managers would like him but, alas, he got hired. I thought I could keep in under wraps but he found out. 

I get this is wrong but not deserving of any kind of abuse..

He was livid. He knew he was mad all day and he waited until I picked him up to tell me what he knew. 

This is when he started telling me it was going to be my last night, again. 

He made me quit my new job on the phone. 

He threw all my work cards out the window. 

He told me that I was going to have to message my family that I was running away so it wouldn‚Äôt fall back on him. 

We were at my apartment because his power was out and his daughter was asleep in the next room when this was all happening. 

He hit my face over twenty times, kicked my body over twenty times with his shoes on, stomped my legs out while I was curled up on the floor, punched my stomach multiple times, threw a screwdriver at my head (it started bleeding and I have a dime sized scab on my head), he swung me around by my hair like I was a merry go round, he stepped on my hands with his full weight, he pulled me up by both my ears and held me between his legs so it felt like my ears were being pulled off my body, he took a fork a left several fork marks on me. He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like the fork will penetrate all the way through.‚Äù

After that he said he was going to kill me. 

He told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to give you as much time as I can. You want that, right?‚Äù

I had my blank face and said, ‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù

This time I was not crying. 

By the grace of some higher power, again, he told me to do something that involved me being right next to the door. He was playing a video game or else he would have noticed I was so close to the only exit. 

I knew I had to leave. I had fuzzy socks on so I slowly took them off, so I could be faster, and reached for my purse. I had already snuck my car key in my pocket earlier because I knew something like this was going to happen. 

This is when I had to make the worst decision. 

He had told me before that he would kill my cats if I did anything against him. That was a big reason I couldn‚Äôt leave all those times. I couldn‚Äôt let anything happen to them. 

I made the decision and had to put myself before my cats. 

In a split second decision, I ran out the door without looking back. 

All I heard in the distance was him say, ‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù

I got to my car and I feel like I put it in reverse before I even turned the car on, that‚Äôs how fast I was going. 

I was driving forward and I saw him coming straight for my car. I swerved right and then left to avoid him but ended up clipping him slightly. I looked in my rear view and saw him lying on the floor. 

‚ÄúI should go back and check on him.‚Äù 

And I immediately stopped myself from thinking that and called my mom. 

My mom didn‚Äôt know everything that was going on but she did know that she did not like him. 

He was calling me non-stop. I did not answer. I just talked to my mom until I got to her house. 

She picked up the phone when he called the last time and told him everything that he was: 

A piece of shit, horrible person who beat me and threatened my life. 

He has a daughter and my mom asked him, ‚ÄúWhat if someone did this to her!?‚Äù

I hope that‚Äôs still resonating with him. 

Imagining someone swinging their daughter around like a play toy or being threatened to death will hopefully change a person. 

I get guilty thinking that my cats could be dead right now if he decided to take that extra step and kill them. I think his daughter being there is the only thing that saved them. 

I‚Äôm having the worst flashbacks this time. Every time after he abused me he had the chance to take it back.

He didn‚Äôt get that chance this time. 

He could plead to me that he really ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt going to kill me‚Äù but how am I supposed to know that?

Was I supposed to wait and find out??

If I did wait, I don‚Äôt believe I would be writing this right now.","I got away, again.",co_dill,2020-01-06 20:33:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ekzulh/i_got_away_again/,9,1.0,12,4,2197
domesticviolence,"Happy new year everyone.

I feel pretty good right now. My ex is in jail. I‚Äôve decided to move out of my current apartment before his release. I may go as far as moving hours away from my current city. I can always come back to visit and when I do I‚Äôll be too busy with friends to worry about running into him. I know with enough time running into him won‚Äôt even bother me... it‚Äôll be like walking past a piece of dog shit on the sidewalk.

Anyways, I‚Äôm just pretty proud of myself right now. It took me a very long time to be able to physically defend myself from him. I had gotten in a couple fights when I was a kid and had always been able to hold my own until him. It took a very long time for me to be able to fight back with any success.

It feels great to be sitting here in this nail salon getting my toes done, imagining him sitting in jail, replaying the last time he showed up at my front door and tried to over power me. I bit him so hard part of his tattoo came out in my mouth, I tore his clothes, I gave him a bloody lip and sent his ass scrambling out the door of my apartment building. He was scared and desperate to get away from me. I don‚Äôt consider myself a violent person but it‚Äôs just so satisfying to think about.

domesticviolence,"I'm overly inclined toward my partner. I suppose it's a bit of searching a father figure I haven't had. For example, I'm doing a dish yesterday, kitchen is a mess, which he simple can't stand, kids start running, situation gets heated, he grabs a wiper and cleans the floor in angry tone with a swear and comment how I should buy food outdoor from now on. This triggered a deep emotional pain in that moment because I wanted to make some nice meal for myself, kids and even him, after I came from a long exhausting walk. I suppose somewhere in my furthest corner of my mind I'm still waiting for appraisal from my father, who was also such an emotionally crippled man. When I didn't get it but an assault instead I was hurt, which suddenly turned into anger. Such a pure emotion of anger. I was ready to spit number of swears to him and tell him sentences that would provoke even bigger conflict between two of us because I wanted to see him upset, angry and hurt. But I didn't, because I didn't want to talk to him, I was in fear he would hit me again, and I was coughing hard at that very moment with tears in my eyes. When he went out from the room I was in tears, sobbing. 

After I calmed down I realized I was projecting my own relation with my father on our relation where I was expecting some tender tone but got nasty treatment as usual. If it were opposite situation where I was angry at him for a mess and if I told him same swear I would not perceive my own tone neither my swear as such a big assault nor provocation. It was my previous trauma that amplified my emotion. And if I had have answered him back in aggression and anger he would not reply with his real or reasonable reaction but with his projection of what has happened before between us and what he had has experienced as a child in his own family. It would be projection against projection and huge conflict. While the objective truth is that kitchen really was in a mess, kids really were annoying, he was truly nervous at the moment, I got a criticism and I was rightfully hurt but should not being hurt to that extend to wish to attack back and intensify the whole thing.

Ten minutes later we were not arguing. Though, we are without tone for two weeks now. It's bad and it's not normal. I have to go out from this relationship as soon as I can.","""Observe but don't act"" principle is quite something",noahloahboah,2020-01-06 11:05:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eksord/observe_but_dont_act_principle_is_quite_something/,0,1.0,4,8,443
domesticviolence,"I am currently a female university student and I believe I'm being emotionally and physically abused by my parents and oldest brother. I'm just really confused and upset and my family's demeanor is always changing. I've heard about the cycle of abuse but I don't know if this applies to me. Whenever I read signs of abuse, I can always check almost every box off. Here are just a few examples, all except #1 from the **last few days**.

Ex 1: This past summer I was taking summer classes and my parents and brother didn't agree with me taking it. They were forcing me to complete something I didn't want to and I was trying my best although I had other goals. When my classes started, they took my car keys and prevented me from leaving. TO GO TO SCHOOL. Them a few days later decided to let me go and when I had to drop out because of them they blamed me for it. Read more background:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ejaegx/i\_hate\_anytime\_i\_have\_a\_break\_from\_school/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ejaegx/i_hate_anytime_i_have_a_break_from_school/) 

Ex 2: My parents are constantly criticizing me EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY. It's gotten to the point where I don't even come out of my room to grab breakfast and not eating until the middle of the night if it means not having to interact with them. If I do interact with them occasionally, they still ALWAYS criticize everything. If I'm putting something in the dishwasher my dad will call me lazy even though there are still plenty of dishes available for use. He once did that and grabbed the bowl out of my hand and raised his hand at me and then started cleaning it himself. Then he told me I should be ashamed of making ""my father do the dishes"". 

Ex 3: As I've gotten older, my parents have become worse in a sense. Ever since I started college, my dad began calling me a prostitute for reasons that don't even make sense. 

Ex 4: My parents have gotten physical with me many times before, but the most recent was when my mom and I had to go to an event. Now if my mom asks me to do something, she will continue to ask every 30 minutes from dawn till dusk and will scream and shout it at you. And it's for the stupidest reasons. She told me to cut my nails and treats me like I'm dumb for not knowing this myself. I DO know and was going to do it soon but for the next two days she would come into my room while I was doing work and threaten and hit me. 

Now a more specific time was about a week ago my mom and I had to go to an event. Now she's been telling me to get ready since morning and shower but we don't have to leave until later into the evening. I keep telling her okay as I want to deep clean my room first and then go into the shower so I don't get sweaty after the fact. Well, she just keeps getting more and more violent. So I lock the door while I'm cleaning so I'm not disturbed and she knocks as if she's going to break the door down and I open every 30 minutes and tell her I'll go soon. Eventually just as I'm finishing up (only had to the bed sheets left to change), she knocks and screams again and I open it and then turn the lock again telling her I'm finishing up. She doesn't back down and gets in my face screaming at me. Then my dad comes in and starts screaming at me saying ""you've been arguing with your mother all day. How many times have I told you to never argue with your mother!? You want me to disgrace you(meaning you want me to hit you but in a very sexist way)!? \*holds his hand over me like he's going to hit me and getting very close to intimidate me\* Go to the shower RIGHT NOW! I don't want to hear you argue with your mother again! Just listen to her and don't argue back!"" 

So I'm angry but I'd pretty much finished up so I grab my stuff and head to bathroom closing my door behind me. Then I realize I forgot my lotion so I go back to room. It won't open. I accidentally locked myself out of the room and my mom notices but I just go back to bathroom and in my head I was like I'll figure it out later because they were still raging. But my mom screams at me more and my dad hears and comes back and then starts screaming ""you're so stupid! You're so stupid! We want to love you but we shouldn't!"" I try explaining it was by accident and that I can ask the neighbor to borrow their tools (this one didn't work with a hanger) and he keeps screaming the same thing at me, grabs my hair, pushes me onto the bath tub ledge and hits saying that he's been hearing me argue with my mom all day. Mind you that I'm a grown women completing my undergrad. Then he leaves and I close the door and they both just keep screaming from outside the door. They got the apartment locksmith to open the door while I was in the shower and then everything was back to 'normal'.

The reason I'm confused is because after it all happens they claim to be ""doing what's best for me"" and that ""I caused them to take that action"". They give me food but at the same time scream at me if I try to make food by myself but then scream at me because I don't cook (and I should because I'm a woman). I can't even walk outside of the house without a reason and if I do then someone MUST go with me. They scream at me to get a job but only one that five minutes walking distance which I can't fit into my schedule. I can't even do a work study from my school that's in between classes because they won't allow it. They even scream at me if I'm applying to scholarships and I don't even tell them if I win because they will just try to take it. So I don't have a job and they blame me for putting them in credit card debt!

Lastly, what make me the most confused is I know they're not like this to everyone. As soon as they're talking to anyone but family they will be the nicest people in the world. They won't call you horrible names, threaten, hit or anything to you. But as soon as the door closes it happens all over. I'm leaving next week with my other brother(we're both really scared of our family and our safety).

we visit my family for holidays since I've moved in with him, and I've noticed a pattern after three years. 

some of the trips we've spent the entire time arguing. other times not so much. but, regardless of how much we argue we ALWAYS have an argument that gets physical on the last day, and only on the last day. then, he always comes around and apologizes. he will add on another day and it'll go the same way every ""last day here"" until we physically have to go home because of his job.

is this him kind of showing me what I'm in for. like reminding me that it's not over. that when we get back home it's back on? (the physical abuse)

domesticviolence,"I grew up in abusive home, and got married to escape it. As you might guess, he abused me too.

I was too afraid to leave, as I thought I would be killed. And, my heart rather inconveniently loved him. One night I was beaten severely enough to go the hospital. He went to prison and I ran.

domesticviolence,"Sorry if it‚Äôs choppy, I‚Äôm still worked up about what happened but I really need some advice. 

I‚Äôve been staying at my boyfriends apartment for a couple of months now. We were dating for 6 months and ended up taking a break for 2 months, we got back together 3 or 4 months ago. Our relationship has been kind of rough the past month but today it escalated tremendously. We were arguing for over and hour and he ended up telling me that he liked me better when I was drunk. This really got to me so I walked away and slammed the door to the bedroom. I was laying in bed trying to cool off when he screamed from the other room asking me if I knew what mania felt like or what it felt like wanting to cause violence. Long story short he ended coming into the room saying concerning things and slamming the door back and forth. The things he was saying and the way that he was acting was scaring me. So I got out of the bed got my coat, my phone, and my car keys and tried walking out. He wouldn‚Äôt let me, he started screaming at me and I tried getting around him. He wouldn‚Äôt let me through.

This is when I got really scared. I tried pushing him out of the way and I finally got past him into the living area. From there he wouldn‚Äôt let me out the front door. I told him that if he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave I would call the police. He then took my phone and asked me what the fuck I thought I was doing. 

I was fearful of what he was going to do to me so I tried my hardest to get my phone (I weigh 110 pound) which was a battle. Once I finally got my phone out of his grip I started crawling on the floor trying to call someone, anyone. He tackled me and tried to make it so I couldn‚Äôt move. I crawled back into the bedroom by the time he took my phone again. I ended up biting his leg because I was fearful to why he wouldn‚Äôt let me have my phone or let me call someone. 

This went on for a couple more minutes and his friends ended up coming home and seeing me bawling hysterically. I screamed that he attacked me and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave or call anyone and they did nothing to help me until I finally got outside with my things. My boyfriend followed me and continued to stand behind my car not letting me leave. 

After about 30 minutes of talking to his friend in my car making sure my boyfriend couldn‚Äôt get in I finally got to leave. 

I‚Äôm meeting up with him tomorrow to talk things through and I guess my question is if this will ever be able to work? I have trauma in my history and I‚Äôm terrified to even go back there.

domesticviolence,"Hello  everyone, A close friend in California has a RO on her ex husband  because of domestic violence. Due to the RO she also has custody of her  little girl but visitation is still in the process of being decided with  just a temporary visitation with the father for the time being while  the trial is still under way. In the mean time they are meant to  communicate through the app "" Our Family Wizard"" and they were ordered  to just use it for visitation arrangements and short notifications  regarding the visitation. They pass the child off through a third party.

Anyway,  her ex, is using the app to intimidate her but doing it in a ""friendly""  round about way, trying not to make it too obvious but the control and  intimidation, also the arguing is still there. She does not try to  respond much keeping it short and sweet but that makes him so mad, he is  mad that she will not fight with him and if she doesn't respond right  away he freaks out as well, he expects her to respond when he says so.

If  he has a restraining order why on earth is he allowed to talk to her  whenever and however he wants through the app? Long four page  argumentative messages. He always uses their girl as an excuses to  lecture her, intimidate her, boss her, etc. He is forcing their daughter  to guilt her into allowing more visitation time off the normal schedule  and he changes plans through the child constantly because he thinks if  the child said it then it doesn't look like his plan, for example if  they are late he blames the child. Also during the first trial had his  family member follow her into the bathroom to intimidate her but luckily  there was another woman with her to protect her.

Another  thing he is doing is Parental alienation and also getting his daughter  to spy on her mom and report back to him. He tells his daughter to not  allow anyone but the mom in his house (he no longer lives there) and  tells her to throw a fit if someone is there. Also he is forcing the  child to communicate with him constantly when the girl is with her mom  during her moms visitation hours. The child always breaks down the first  48 hours of returning home to their mom, crying, hitting, screaming,  and only calms down when they are settled and happy in a calm  environment. When she is at her dads she eats poorly and its constant  chaos because he is just in party mode.

domesticviolence,"Hi everyone. Asking for your advice because I'm experiencing some pretty out of proportion heart ache right now.

I was with violent ex for 6 years. It was so bad that I stayed single for 2 whole years. I felt ready last year and met a guy on Tinder. He was gentle and quiet as well as handsome and the combination made me quickly fall for him. I kept this to myself and we took it kind of slow. We were long distance and had to put in the effort to see each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Something was wrong with him from the beginning. I think it might have been Aspergers. He never opened up to me about much of his life, or things he loved to do. He said he was in therapy because he struggled with emotions. He said people accused him of being inconsiderate. I knew he'd had a bad car crash and I spent the majority of our time wondering if it had impacted his brain, or if it was Aspergers. Anyway, his inability to connect with me was always going to prevent us being life partners.

&amp;#x200B;

Putting that to one side, I fell for him because we were so committed. We would travel across the country to see each other. He would come on a work night and go the following morning! I stayed at his house for 5 nights and worked from home there. He couldn't cope. He was supposed to be off work those days but would leave each day and return late.  The other huge thing that made me so attached was in how caring he was in bed. I have never had 'loving' sex before. He freed me from my ex by asking me in bed what I liked (I didn't even know), and he went so out of his way to give me pleasure. He touched me in ways that I don't think I will be touched again. I don't even know how to touch myself like that.

This whole thing has ended now because we admitted to each other that we cannot connect. We don't know what it was that we had. He said he sensed I'm withdrawn and unable to be myself, He hated how he was having that impact. But all I was doing was trying not to stress him out. I could sense it. He thought he was hiding Aspergers but he wasn't. He even taught me how to stim him. I won't go into the extensive details but he could not operate in many social settings. He would freeze. Then he had a huge OCD thing at home. He had a type of mind blindness. He cared for me a lot. He showed care in his own ways but there was massive problems. We couldn't go to the supermarket, sit in the car together, eat, cook..without his anxieties causing him to completely shut down. He was sensitive to light, sound, touch (hated hugging). He said he had a rock for a heart but he was working on it. I even cried on the phone once and he didn't realise. He couldn't recognise facial expressions. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get over this? I look back at my 2 relationships. One with a violent man, and another with a guy who had the BEST intentions and put effort in, but still led me to behave like I was in a coercive relationship.  I put my needs to one side, I did everything his way, I was unable to voice it if I disagreed... I cancelled plans, I put my needs last. But there was no malice in him. This sense of self neglect I have again is so strong. I did it to myself all over again. But this guy...he freed me and I want him back.. even though I know day-to-day we were always at risk of this Aspergers thing making him do/say hurtful things (which he was doing all the time).

domesticviolence,"Ah man how do I even start.. I guess from the start. My girlfriend and I live together and have so for 2 years. Last month I made a horrible mistake when I went out of town. I visited a friend \[24F\], that I was fooling around with many years ago.Lets call her B. We have stayed friends since then and is for sure my best friend. I was gonna sleep at my girlfriends parents house because they live in the same city but when I was gonna go home, it was 6 am and I was so tired so I stayed at B's apartment and slept there. I told my girlfriend this.

When I got back home the next day me and my girlfriend had a conversation about it. She was ofcourse unhappy and confused why I went through all the trouble talking to her parents about sleeping at their place when I ended up sleeping at B's place anyway. The conversation ended with her wanting to look at my messages between me and B. In those messages she found a video I had sent B. It was a video of me and B kissing which was recorded before I even met my girlfriend so I havent cheated. She got really upset and very sad, I can understand why.

I asked myself why did I send that video? Normal friends doesnt do that but when I sent her that video, the thought didnt even cross my mind. It was real stupid sending it and I regret it. At least neither me or B acted on that video, she wrote: ""Haha"" and that was it.

After my girlfriend got upset she cried and yelled that I was a cheating pig. She then began to hit me, multiple times. She kicked me, threw water at me and threw a metal container filled with coffee. She picked up my tennis racket and hit me with it, breaking my phone (which was in my pocket) in the progress, then tried to break my tennis racket. I felt the need to get out of there so I tried to pack a bag. She then continuessly poured water in my bag so I tried to pack another one, she did the same to that one, this was repeated several times. Finally I picked up the bag anyway with wet clothes and ran.

Fast-forward to now. Over the holiday she went to another town. We have had a few calls but only about having a real conversation on how to deal with this. Those calls were not pleasent to say the least. She gets back next week and just recently texted me that I need to move out. Her parents own the apartment so I dont have much of a choice. Furtunantly, my parents live 30 minutes away and I can stay at their house.

Im really confused on what to do here, Id love to get some opinions. I feel like I could move to my parents for a week or so but she doesnt know when or if I can move back in. Her way of talking hints that she has no plans to talk about how I feel about her hitting me. She had said horrible things over the last two weeks which doesnt feel right. She has expressed that she needs to think, if she wants to be with me or not. But I feel I am the one violated. I know I did wrong sending that video but violence is and should always be unacceptable. She has also shown tendencies to aggressive behavior before, like shoving, slamming doors and throwing stuff. Im larger than her I didnt feel afraid of being severely hurt, although I got some small bruises. Im very unsure on how to act on this and I am afraid I am not concerned enough.

So do I look for another place? Do I say fuck it and end the relationship? Do I wait untill we have had a conversation about all of this? Maybe she does apologize.

TL;DR! My girlfriend hit me multiple times after she had seen a video of me kissing my best friend. She found the video by looking into my messages between me and my friend B. B and I fooled around years ago but I sent her the video 3 months ago. The video was taken many years ago, before I met my girlfriend.

domesticviolence,"This feels a bit weird to type... partly not sure this is even the right place but mostly because honestly I feel very disconnected from what is going on, and everything I've heard is hearsay... as in I haven't seen or confirmed anything myself. Most of what I hear came from my mom and the family friend's mother. I'm not particularly close to the victim either, but I am to her mother. So I guess I'll explain what is going on as best I can.

FF - Family Friend - The person getting away from her boyfriend. Has a less than a year old baby. Currently lives with Boyfriend.  
FFM - Family Friend's Mother - She lives next door to us and I regularly lend my car and help her out when I can with anything. Childhood friend of my mother.

BF - Boyfriend - The abuser. Bigger and stronger than me. Been told he's beating FF and even made death threats. Mentions he might do drugs were mentioned. Last time I actually seen him myself was months ago (before the baby was born) and seemed normal to me. Never really talked to him beyond ""Hello"".  
MM - My Mother - Owns the house FFM lives in. The person who gets everything done. Not 100% sure she is relevant.  
Me - 27, Male, 5'4"" short skinny guy who's completely out of shape. If BF tries anything violent... I'd be beaten easily. I live with my mother. Also I have never been around violence/abuse at all.  


All of this is taking place in South Carolina.

So what is going on is tomorrow afternoon I'm going to drive FFM and FF to the doctor's to get the baby their very first shots. And afterwards we're taking FF to a woman's shelter... I think. If not... where ever it is it's not back to her house with her boyfriend. And once she is safely away we are planning to get the cops involved. FFM mentioned a protection order or something. I'm worried though that when I go to pick up FF and her baby, there is a strong chance BF could try to do something. Either physically prevent FF from leaving with us, or getting into my car on his own to try and come with us. If BF gets in my car I am not leaving at all with him in it. Though... not really what sure to do if he starts making threats towards me or something. In my mind I'm thinking I'd just stand my ground, not particularly worried for my own safety... but I'm not sure what will happen. And if he threaten's FF, FFM, or the baby... I would have no idea what to do.

I should note that today, FFM used my mother's car to drive to FF's house and try to get her away from BF. Somehow BF found out this was going to happen and hit FF and made death threats or something... with FF calling BF deranged. So we're going to try again tomorrow with the doctor's visit as an excuse with me coming along too.  Though this is all through FFM. This is also the first time I heard mention of BF using drugs. I trust FFM's word though. Oh and FFM mentioned BF has three out of state warrants for his arrest, though none bad enough to have him shipped back to the state the warrants are based in. I don't know how that stuff works.  


That's about it. So... any advice on what to expect, or what might be a good idea to keep in mind? And what I can do to help out after we get FF away from BF? Or what to do if something prevents her from getting away?",Helping family friend and her baby get away from her abusive boyfriend.

domesticviolence,"I am in a bad domestic violent situation with my husband of 4 years. Lately his violent attacks have increased and I hate to say this feels like it came from nowhere. He was an angel when I met him. Loving me and treating me with respect. I never expected for him to do the things he did to me recently. The abuse took a full swing in September when he punched me in my arms and back and left bruises... the next day he apologized and made a promise to seek help.
 I believed him and every part of me felt angry, but hey at least he‚Äôs trying. 
Fast forward to New Year‚Äôs Eve night approximately 2:00 am, my husband and I fought recently over something so small and mundane (name calling on his part in which I told him to stop). I came home from a NYE party to rest on the bed, scroll through Facebook and put our 1 year old to sleep. Suddenly husband is walking in from work and greets the baby and me acting like our fight never took place. I greet him, but mind you I‚Äôm still in the bed very tired at watching little bean all day. This angers him. So I decide to go into the kitchen. I ask him why he‚Äôs not eating the food I cooked for him, he mumbles something (don‚Äôt really recall), but I see he‚Äôs getting really pissed so I go back to bed because I‚Äôm just wiped. Next thing I know he‚Äôs yelling and screaming at me in the room and asking why I‚Äôm not serving him sitting out there with him and acting like I don‚Äôt care about him. I explain to him I‚Äôm really tired from the party and that my stomach hurts because I ate too much. At this point he‚Äôs screaming so much I just shut down and go on my phone...big mistake. He suddenly leaps into the bed and starts slapping the back of my neck pushing me out of the bed. I shriek and corner myself into the wall he tries to hit me more I just kick him off. Mind you, my 1yo is on the bed looking at us with his mouth agape and eyes wide. Suddenly, he backs off and I square up to protect my face, he sees this as a invitation to continue fighting and I scurry to the bathroom while asking him to please not hit me. I‚Äôm by the entryway of the bathroom and for a second I dropped my hands for something and got a hard slap to my jaw/neck/right ear that almost knocked me off my feet and I accidentally urinated on myself. At that point he‚Äôs done and he takes his pillow and sleeps on the couch while my 1 yo and me sleep in the bed in my arms. Today New Year‚Äôs Day, as soon as I woke up and I got me and my son dressed and fed and went to an urgent care clinic where a doctor examined me and put in an order for an x-ray tomorrow. I didn‚Äôt tell the doctor my husband did this I told him I got into a fight and been icing the area on and off along with taking ibuprofen. When I returned home, I went right back to bed because my neck, head and back was still hurting. My husband approaches me and wants to know about what the doctor said. I told him about the x ray and pain. He looks at it and says it‚Äôs not that bad. I don‚Äôt react and just tell him I‚Äôm going to sleep. He rejects my wishes and demands we patch this fight up. At this point so you know I‚Äôm damaged and just respond and say what he wants to hear so to stop him from attacking me. I apologize to him about cause the fight and promising him to not cause fights like these ever again. He said I caused the fight and that I‚Äôm responsible. He then promises to never hit me again. All the while I cannot look him in the eye because I‚Äôm afraid of him and he keeps telling me ‚Äúlook at me, my face is right here, stop looking down‚Äù. 
He then says to make up for this you need to have sex with me. I resist and leave the room as I don‚Äôt want any affection and just want rest. He orders me back into the room and yeah raped me. I‚Äôm balling my eyes out and was saying I want my mom. I guess I was too loud for him and he struck me on the right side where I have that injury twice. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want his brother to hear me crying in the next room. He said to me stop crying. I stopped crying due to fear he would continue hitting me. After I went straight to the bathroom crying and red. I showered off and went to sleep and feigned that I was sleep so he would leave for work. Just an FYI, our 1yo was sleeping in the crib in his room when this event took place. Husband knew this and I believe took advantage of the opportunity to assault me. I need advice please, like I said the abuse started in September and he is only getting worst and hitting harder, possibly causing injury. Each time he has hit me I‚Äôve taken pictures of the attack. The only change he‚Äôs made in his life is he‚Äôs using marijuana daily, but as far as I know doesn‚Äôt drink or do drugs...he‚Äôs just abusive.

domesticviolence,"On this day 6 years ago, I was broken. I was up late watching infomercials and promising myself I‚Äôd never have another New Years Eve like the one I‚Äôd just had. I was exhausted from screaming, crying, and tending to my wounds caused by my drunk boyfriend. Earlier that night, he had grabbed me by wrists and pinned me against a wall, then slammed my head against a door frame. He then locked me out of our bedroom and went to sleep. I made a bed for myself on the couch, grabbed a bag of frozen vegetables from our freezer, and prepared for a sleepless night. My wrists and forearms felt raw, my chest and back hurt from being pinned, my head was throbbing, and my spirit was broken. I made all kinds of promises to myself that night. I‚Äôd never fight with him again, I‚Äôd never let him hit me again, I‚Äôd get rid of all the alcohol in the house, but I knew those were nice little lies I was telling myself so I‚Äôd feel better.  I realized I couldn‚Äôt control him or his actions, that what he did to me was not my fault. I couldn‚Äôt fix or change him, and I definitely couldn‚Äôt live like that anymore. I took a deep breath and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never have another New Years Eve like this again‚Äù. I stayed true to my word, I left him that year. 
 
Today my life is very different. I spent my NYE with a man who truly loves and cares for me, this will be our second year together.

domesticviolence,"So, here I am crying on New Year's Day having had zero sleep and alone. On 12/30 my husband and I had a huge fight. He came home after 12am saying he was working late. I didn't buy it and was angry...I did hit him but nothing compared to what he did to me. He slapped me so hard that he busted my lip and slapped me again and I fell to the ground and also broke my phone to pieces, broke some furniture. I just couldn't believe he was doing this to me. I don't think he will ever change even though he keep making promises. I was in an accident 3 years ago and due to this have 3 herniated discs and can't work bc of severe pain, so I depend on him. It's so hard because a huge part of me wants to leave and just disappear but I'm so scared of being out there alone. So tonight I told him that I was going to stay home for New Years because I had been in so much pain all day. I expected him to say he would stay with me and watch a movie or something. His response...okay I'm going to my Aunt's house. He showered changed and left. He didn't even care to call me or anything. It's after 5 am and he isn't home and I can't stop crying. I also came across something suspicious today on his youtube account. He had searched for ""how to treat your lover"" and watched several videos about having a lover/how to not fall in love with your lover.  A little history on our marriage...we got married in early 2018, but I separated from him in Feb. 2019 due to abuse and problems with him and pornography (I'm Christian so pornography is definitely not something we do). He promised me he changed and wanted to work on our marriage and do counseling. We are supposed to have our first meeting on 1/11 and I recently came back home just last week. Now with all of this I just don't think it's worth it to even try. Since I've been here he shows me little to no affection, won't even sleep in the same bed as me and he's still very abusive. I had been staying at my brother's house but there's no way I can go back there. I have severe pain daily and that's something my brother doesn't understand, instead he gets angry at me and thinks I'm being lazy. Sometimes I just want to disappear. :( Why couldn't he agree to having a divorce? Instead he made me believe he loved me and was willing to change. I don't even want to tell my family what has happened, I feel so ashamed. Also, this morning I said to him look what you did to my lip when you smacked me. He says, I didn't smack you - that happened when I was taking the phone from your hand. I screamed at him and said What? You smacked me several times, and then his face changed and he said yes I did smack you, I'm sorry. I know I need help for my anger issues. :(( I don't know what to do and feel so helpless. It feels like I'm the only one in the world with a failed marriage and a husband who doesn't even think I'm attractive anymore even though I've been told I'm very pretty. :''''( Gosh, I just wish my marriage was healthy and NORMAL.

domesticviolence,"
I‚Äôve found myself in the middle of a possible abusive situation and I‚Äôm at a loss on how to handle it.

Tonight at a small New Year‚Äôs Eve party between close friends there was a couple (John and Jane) that showed up, I had never met them before. John is a friend of one of my friends and the couple lives in another country, visiting for the holidays.

I talked a lot with Jane and we connected talking about our jobs. At some point out of the blue she started to get emotional, almost crying, and told me and another friend that John hits her. Of course we tried to tell her that this was unacceptable, she needs to leave him. She made us promise not to tell anyone. I gave her my phone number and told her to contact me if she ever needed help or a place to stay.

John wanted to leave the party and he could see that Jane wasn‚Äôt in a good place after our conversation. He asked what was going on and she said nothing. They left wanting to drive back. Everyone at the party was quite drunk at this point including them.

They left and 10 minutes after I received a phone call from Jane saying she wanted me to come and get her. She wasn‚Äôt specific on the phone, but she sent me her location and multiple texts saying that they were in the car, then ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt get out of the car‚Äù. Despite promising, I had told other people at the party that I was worried about them. Not knowing what was going on 5 of us left the party to go see what the situation was.

In the end they had decided not to drive seeing as they were fucked up and needed a place to crash. I proposed that they spend the night at my apartment which was not far on foot. I especially wanted to keep an eye on them.

Also at this point my friends started to confront John about being violent. He seemed like he didn‚Äôt know how to react and kept on asking Jane what she said to us to make us ask these questions. He never denied hitting her and said he felt attacked.
The discussion in the street became a bit heated so I pushed the couple to come to my place to talk it out and sober up. 

They accepted and at my place with Jane in the other room,  John started asking me what Jane said to us exactly. I tried to calm the whole situation by saying she didn‚Äôt say anything specific about their relationship and that I just caught a weird vibe and wanted to make sure everyone was safe. I set them up beds on my couches.
 These two strangers are currently sleeping in my living room and I‚Äôm here in my bed asking myself what I should do. 

I think I‚Äôll send a text to Jane asking to get together for coffee before they go back home to continue the conversation we were having about our jobs (in case John reads her messages). I want to talk frankly with her about her situation with out John near.

How can I help her? What are some ways that I can introduce the idea of leaving him and taking her life back into her hands?",In need of advice,meanbeam,2020-01-01 09:34:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eiglyq/in_need_of_advice/,4,1.0,3,4,559

(I was 50kg when we met and was 60kg after having our son) i told him to stop as he was hurting my feelings, he didn't he was so out of it that he grabbed me by the arms and tried to push me out of the house... the next day he apologised and promised not to do it again as I told him I will leave him with our son... no other events after that until our youngest was born he's only 5 months old now... he started teaching me how to drive and the lessons will take 4 hours where he gets verbally aggressive saying things very sarcastically making me feel more nervous and stupid... he justifies this by saying he knows me so well and he only wants me to learn the hard way... then another time when he felt I wasn't listening to him he would call me names like c**t etc or tell me to shut up if I'm explaining my side of things also telling me not to talk back to him... 

One time we were having this argument and I was explaining myself,  he threw my phone on the worktop with such force that the case came off, I burst out crying but managed to stop myself as the kids might see or hear me... I forgot how we managed to fix this I remember telling him never to do that again or I'd go...

Now an hour after new year just after greetings we went to bed and started chatting about our eldest kid (teen) how he thinks she has no respect for us as parents as she's always in her room or frowning when asked to do stuff and how lucky she is with how we are generous to her financially,  I said we are only trying to be fair to all the kids and I don't want her to feel left out... he said she's 18 she should know better I agreed with him on some areas but while I was explaining myself he kept interrupting me so I asked him to let me finish but he still wouldn't... he suddenly smashed my laptop on the bed a few times while telling me to shut up when it hit my shin I said ouch so he pinched my knee and told me to shut up you c**t!! I was speechless... 

I don't know what to do... I have a decent job and will be back to work next week...

domesticviolence,"Yesterday my bf called me a fucking idiot after I told him our dog was doing submissive urination because she was scared cause the way he treats her. He hit her multiple times because she pooped on the wall 3 times instead of asking to go to the bathroom. He claims this is discipline. 

I tell him not to hit her and it's abuse and he tells me to shut up or go to bed or calls me fucking idiot. I got mad and left the other day with my one month old. It wasn't just over this. I've been with him 5 years and he has a bad attitude. He's threatened to fuck me up the other day(I told him I was going to sleep with a guy which was a total lie. I was upset about him cheating on me sleeping with an ex in our bed and texting female friends late at night so I lied and said I was doing the same thing he actually did but then I told him it was a lie). Anyway he told me put the baby down I'm going to fuck u up. I'll just go to jail then get out. 

He got mad about stepping in dog poop once and blamed me and threw a shirt at me and flinched in my face before. 

He got frustrated and called our 1 month a stupid mf when he peed in his bassinet once. 

He's good to me sometimes so it's hard. I genuinely love him and I was engaged at one point to him. Then when we left my own family didn't want me there even with my baby and he didn't care if we were homeless he threatened to throw the baby's things out. 

My baby got sick so he let us come back. My name is on the lease too though so technically he couldn't stop us but he didn't want us back. It hurts that he was threatening to throw out the baby's stuff and he wouldn't let him have the bouncer to sleep in. All this stuff is from his baby shower. 

When u call shelters or the abuse line u get the run arounds. They didnt really help me. I used my own money to get a hotel for me and my baby. They basically just tell u go get in line for a shelter but in a nice way.

domesticviolence,"
Growing up I've seen how my dad can get extremely angry pretty easily and verbally degrade my mother but I never saw anything physical until I was about 11 when he had her pinned against the wall by the throat but she scratched him so hard he backed off. For some reason this was seen as a minor incident and I've not forgotten it but my mother seemed pretty happy regardless? He still gets angry a lot and has short sharp rants about a lot of things but mostly never particularly about her.

Now it's New Year's Eve and my dad's gotten pretty drunk to the point that he's not even raising his voice, he's just saying stuff all calm, apparently threatening to strangle her and my sister told me there's already been plates and glasses thrown. I was going to call the police but my sister snatched my phone and told me she would if there were any more loud noises or threats. I don't really know what to do at all to help her get away so I just need advice on what to do next.

domesticviolence,"I finally left him 2 days ago. During this relationship he choked me multiple times, kicked me, threw things at my face, pulled my hair, spat on me, tried to snap my phone in half for being on the phone to a friend, took pillows and blankets from me and made me sleep on the tiled floor (this happened all the time.) and punished me any time I yelled for help. He also became even more angry and violent any time I physically defended myself to the point I had to cower down and beg him to not hurt me. He followed me after I had escaped out of the house with my cat in her carrier and instead of dragging me back he made threats that scared me enough to walk back with him, telling me that he would call police on ME and make sure I would be locked in a mental hospital. He was very abusive during my pregnancy. I would hide in the closet with my cat and to try to protect her and the unborn baby. He told me he is happy that I had a miscarriage, and that I would have been a bad mother. 2 days ago was the final straw after an entire night of physical and verbal abuse. He tore me down completely and then purposely stood over the cat and screamed at the top of his lungs at her. This is after I told him to not yell around the cat. He fell asleep in the morning. I packed my things and left with the cat. I'm now safe staying with a friend and their family. My cat is with me. She's safe and not stressed. I believe if I had not left he would have killed both of us either that day or within the coming days. Before leaving I had shared a double room with ex abuser. He can not afford that room by himself but rent is paid for another week. He has not contacted me which is a good thing but also confusing. I have been eating and trying to build my energy back up. I have some money put away and I have already been contacting rooms to move into long term with my cat. I'm still very anxious after what happened.

domesticviolence,"I (30F) had a baby 5 weeks ago with my husband (30M). Through the course of the pregnancy he and I had a couple of serious arguments where he said and did some unforgivably hurtful things to me and my son (4M) from a previous relationship, which lead me to believe he had some anger issues. He threatened to leave saying that he is unhappy in the relationship. We ended up working things out and staying together, and I chalked it up to pre-baby jitters, things got better. 

Christmas morning, first thing, he gets into it with my son over the smallest thing which escalated in to him screaming and cursing at me and my son, throwing things. He called my son a dick. My son is only 4 and a completely innocent sweet little boy. We keep arguing, he is saying things like, ""Draft the divorce papers"", he hates me, he compares me to his ex.
I tell him to leave if he's not happy but he refuses, saying, ""Well I pay rent"".
I have a newborn baby with this man. I was a single mom before we married and I struggled terribly before we got together with just one kid, and now I have 2.

domesticviolence,"Last night my wife(27f) and I(30m) got into a heated argument about my daughter getting too loud. She claims I never discipline her and I said that I discipline her too when its needed. By that I meant that I get on her too about being to loud but I didnt think she was being too loud at that time. She took it to mean that I discipline her when its required, all the times she disciplines her is unnecessary. 

At that point she started yelling to (not at) my daughter(6f), who was in the bath, something along the lines that her(my wife) didnt have relevant judgement so she(my daughter) should just ignore her, essentially, it seemed like to me, trying to bring her into our argument. I went into a rage and started screaming at her and I physically got close and was screaming at her to stop. She kick/shoved me back and I landed on a coffee table with a glass top and it broke. I was unhurt and I got up and grabbed her arm and shoved her back. We scuffled a bit shoving each other back and forth. I walked away and she walked off to the bedroom. She threatened to call the cops but didnt. We argued more and I got I her face again a couple times and she shoved me back and I'd shove her too. 

Eventually we calmed down and we bickered back and forth more with her threatening me to call the cops on me and me asking her not to. I'm pretty sure at this point that divorce is a foregone conclusion. I'm just trying to process this. I don't think of myself as an abuser but with how I acted wouldn't this basically be proof that I am one? 

Maybe the toxicity of the relationship drove me to this point and this argument was where my temper got the better of me. Idk. I know her and I both are shitty at this point. But she has threatened more than once to call the cops on me and end my military career in the national guard. That is something I am terrified about but at the same time feel like I probably deserve it. Idk. Happy birthday to me I guess. 

I know what I did was wrong. I plan on seeking therapy. She refuses to consider individual or couples therapy. I posted this to the relationships sub and was told that in so many words. But this is the first time we've gotten physical with each other. Idk. I feel horrible and I'm not sure if I should ask for a divorce or not.

I'm happily married now, but my sensors are always up when it comes to this kind of thing. She's brought him around a few times, and I actually have this feeling like he's scary even though he hasn't displayed any violence per say. Examples (some may just be examples of classic narcissism)?

Domestic violence on his record (but he was framed by the cops/government/media). And he says he is innocent. That is why he can never find work.

9/11 never happened, stunt men/actors jumped out of empty buildings

School shootings never happened, paid actors again and families relocated

The government is burning people live in certain parts of New York, and the government is after him and only him because he has special knowledge, and that is why he can never find work

At a dinner party he openly accused one of the guests of being part of a government operation to spy on him. He stormed out and my friend had to go and placate him

A waitress seated us at the wrong table and he yelled at her very badly

He generally has to be placated like a toddler man baby and told how great he is or he loses his temper

My friend, who surprisingly  I have a very strong and independent woman (so I don't know why she's putting up with this nonsense) is pretty sarcastic so when he said that life would be better if we return to the ""Wild Wild West"" style where everyone dukes it out to the death, she said, ""If I were to free to take you down without consequence, I would. What do you think of that?"" (Definitely in the style of hypothetically turning the tables on him). He stood there with all his veins bulging, jaw clenched, and said ""Well if you want to take me down, I dare you. Why don't you take me down right down while everyone watches."" And she says, ""I was just kidding"" but the exchange goes on for 20 plus minutes before he goes to the bathroom and slams the door. And honestly redditors I actually felt fear at this point because the tension was so bad it brought back these flashbacks of my own past. And I don't know if the guy is going to reappear with a pipe and start beating everyone over the head. Maybe I have a lack of faith in humanity. But I am reminded of having to constantly placate someone who is incapable of seeing things rationally and fearing that they're going to freak out in a dangerous way.

domesticviolence,"Let me start by saying. I‚Äôm sharing my story because I did not talk about it. I hid it and denied it ever happened. It was part Shame
But also I protected my abuser. I was 15 when I met him. Of course he was charming and sweet. Those blue eyes melted me. We would go to the movies together. Always holding hands. Spending as much time together as possible but also hanging out with his two closest friends at the time. The first time he ever put his hands on me was at a friends his and the friends mom was there sitting on the couch smoking cigarettes giving me life advice. We were all having a great time but then his friend goes ‚Äúcome look in the bathroom so and so is passed out‚Äù and I‚Äôm laughing like what?! I go and look and no one was in there and he is laughing at me. So we walk out and he tells my abuser ‚Äúshe just tried looking at my d***‚Äù and my abused grabs my neck and says ‚Äúis that what you were doing sl**‚Äù and I‚Äôm MORTIFIED as he did this in front of everyone. The guy proceeds to tell him to chill out and it was just a joke. My abuser was embarrassed and took off running. We all went after him as he was belligerent. Our relationship was never the same after that moment. Constant choking in front of friends or in private always catching me off guard and for no reason either other than when I received unwanted attention. When he finally graduated from choking to full blown punching me. I was in constant fear but wanted nothing but for him to love me. One time we were eating at a McDonald‚Äôs and a bunch of construction workers came in and he said to me ‚Äúyou want to f*** them don‚Äôt you‚Äù and of course I‚Äôm in utter shock. Every time he would say and do these things I just saw a monster.. the look was something I was all too familiar with. He looked like my father. (Get into that story later) Another time we were laying in his bedroom and he grabbed my neck and said ‚ÄúI could throw you in the pool and drown you‚Äù this lasted for a good year before the worst of it happened. My best friends dad had raped me one time (I was blackout drunk) and she was having this huge party and wanted me to come over even though I didn‚Äôt want to see her dad. She kept me pretty hidden through the crowd. But apparently everyone had known what happened and my abuser boyfriend took me outside pushed me up against the brick wall (I still have a scar from the impact) and screamed at me ‚Äúwas that d*** in your p****?!‚Äù And I denied it didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. It was miserable feeling like it was my fault I was raped.  He knocked me out in front of his friend once. Even laughed and said it was something like UFC. I don‚Äôt remember of course I just remember it was one of those dumb nights of me running after him and then blackout and being forced into the car. His friend did nothing. I think he was afraid of him. The final night of abuse happened. It was near Halloween. I dressed up as a cop. He was a convict. Orange jumpsuit and all. The night was great. We went to a few parties and even had some great pictures of us together. Smiling and happy. As we leave the last party that was really dying down. We get into his car. Turn down a street and.. I see nothing but black. It had only been a few minutes or less based off the location we were. When I come to.. I look down and there‚Äôs blood everywhere. I‚Äôm crying and he‚Äôs screaming at me to ‚Äúget the f*** out‚Äù over and over. I grab whatever is in front of me and run. I‚Äôm running up a street. It‚Äôs around 3 or 4am. I see a rich naive or hood that had a security guard and I thought about running up to him.. but I didn‚Äôt. Then I keep hiding behind bushes(barefoot) because I keep thinking I can hear his car. I do. I hear him calling out my name. But I hide. Frozen. Terrified that he would kill me. When I realize his car is gone I begin running again. I come to a highway underpass and a taxi cab pulls up. A man gets out and he looks horrified by what he sees. He tells me he‚Äôs calling the police but I say ‚Äúno no I‚Äôm just going to my friends‚Äù (why did I do this) and so I keep walk/running. A small suv stops at a light and there‚Äôs two girls in it. I ask for a ride and I confide in them about what happened. They were so sad for me and one girl begged me to go to the police. I promised her I would. My friend opens the door and she was petrified but she was also on drugs at the time. Her dad came out stumbling drunk and took pictures of me. I decided I didn‚Äôt want to be there with my drug addicted friend and her rapist dad. So I left and ran all the way home. Miles. Dark but the sun was rising. I finally get home and see my dads car leave because he worked very early in the morning. I knock on the door and my brother answers but doesn‚Äôt even look at me because he was mad at me for going out with my abuser. He knew bits and pieces about him and clearly wasn‚Äôt a fan. I fall asleep for a few hours. When I wake up I go into the bathroom and my brother comes out and the look on his face was as if I was a ghost. My face was in agonizing pain. How I didn‚Äôt feel it before was beyond me. I‚Äôm guessing adrenaline. I look into the mirror and I want to cry but I can‚Äôt because it hurts too bad. My eyes were both swollen. Blood still covering me. Popped blood vessels in my eyes. My brothers asked me what happened. I said I was jumped by a bunch of girls. He didn‚Äôt believe me. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill him‚Äù and I knew I had to keep up with the lie. I noticed on my home phone there were several missed calls. Incoming call *private number* I answer... ‚Äúbaby where are you I was looking for you all night. What happened there‚Äôs blood all over my car?‚Äù I told him what happened. He reluctantly says ‚Äúyou hit me first‚Äù I took a stand and said ABSOLUTELY NOT. He apologized so much but it was too late. He finally went away to college never seeing me again. But not by my choice. I probably would‚Äôve been with him again. It breaks my heart now nearly 15 years later that I allowed it to happen for so long and that I never turned him in. I hope he hasn‚Äôt done this to anyone else after me. The guilt is too much to bare sometimes.

domesticviolence,"
I was in a two year serious relationship with my ex-boyfriend at the time. We met on Tinder and things took off. So fast, in fact, that after 2 weeks of talking, we started our relationship. It was a Red Flag, that looking back, I wish I would‚Äôve taken notice of. We were in a long distance relationship for the first year of the relationship.


In 2017, me and my family went on a vacation to the Bahamas, and he wasn‚Äôt happy about that because I couldn‚Äôt take him with me. We couldn‚Äôt afford it. Before we left, he told me that if I go that I should ‚ÄúJust find another boyfriend when I go.‚Äù He got extremely jealous about things I would do, that he didn‚Äôt got to do. During the trip he would send me texts  and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see them right away because of the lack of service. He would send texts like ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt love me, and you‚Äôre ignoring me. Have fun having sex with other guys.‚Äù It affected our entire trip because I was stressed out the entire time. I liked him though and I brushed it off as a hiccup. When I got back, he wanted me to go with him to see his family. When we went there, we got into a drunken fight, which escalated to the point where he would hit me and throw things at me. Right in front of his family. After the fight his mom would tell me that ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs normal in our family, don‚Äôt take it too personal.‚Äù He has also turned into the wrong way on an intersection and we almost got into a car accident. This caused a fight to the point where he would get out of the car and try to walk home. The police pulled over and asked us what was going on. We said that we were having troubles with our car and then we got back into our car and drive back.


Later on we got more serious with our relationship that we moved in together in a 4 bedroom apartment with two other roommates. Our fights escalated even more and the abuse got more and more bad. He would throw things at me such as remotes, cups, and even a chair. He would also pinch and punch my legs and arms for a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù When I would tell him to stop, he wouldn‚Äôt.  Our fights would also bring me into a place where I felt like the only way out would be to commit suicide. I made at least 4 suicide attempts when I was with him. Our roommates took notice of what happened and threatened to call the police multiple times. He would then tell me that I had to explain the situation (because he was deaf), however our roommates understood ASL. I would have to lie directly to them about what happened. Our roommates were close childhood friends of mine and my relationship caused me to disconnect from them. So much so that we found a house to rent and we both moved in together. 


We were only in that house for 8 days when another abusive altercation would occur. This time though was different. It was like he just wanted to hurt me and attack me. I had just gotten home one night in June from work and it was about 12AM. I found my ex sitting on the couch sleeping. He was upset and I could tell by his demeanor. I asked if he was going to bed and he said he was sleeping on the couch. Not wanting to start a fight.  I said that I was going to bed because I had to work in the morning. A fight would then ensue because I wasn‚Äôt going to talk to him and I just wanted to go to bed. He pushed the issue to the point where he dragged me out of the bed. He then beat me. It got to the point where he would sit in front of the door and refused to let me leave. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô1 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7. He‚Äôs taller and bigger than I am so I couldn‚Äôt get him to move from the door. I then tried to call 911 and he wouldn‚Äôt let that happen. He grabbed my phone and slid it under the door to hide it. I then tried to leave out the window. He then tried to stop me from doing that. I was then able to run past him and tried to leave the house. He grabbed me and threw me in the other room and then our fight escalated even more. So much so that we were on the ground and proceeded to put his hands around my throat to strangle me. After which I was able to fight back and get him off of me. He scratched my face and I started to bleed. At that point he got up and left the room. I went into the bathroom to try to clean off my face. 

He then states that he wants to talk and that I was to go directly to the living room. I then went to my room to try to get my phone and he saw what I was doing and took my phone. He then went into the kitchen to get something. He was going through cupboards and then I heard what sounded like a knife coming out of the counter. It was at that point that I was able to escape out of the front door to try to escape. We lived next to the campus we both went to school at, and I ran to an emergency box to call 911. I was taken to the hospital because I had a blood spot in the eye, which the police officer found concerning. I was in the hospital all night. The police were able to get my phone from my ex and some shoes. He texted me multiple times while I was in the hospital. Like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I love you. I hope you‚Äôre ok. Please text me.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt buying it. The police told me that they were going to arrest him. I didn‚Äôt say a word about it. 

After he was arrested his mom bailed him out on bond and was able to go to a different state. He then got his friends to send me messages such as ‚ÄúYou should feel ashamed of yourself‚Äù and even had someone come to my work to say that. I had to quit my job and struggled this semester with classes because of the court trial. I got a restraining order on him and it was the shortest protection order hearing i have ever seen. I was so afraid during the past 6 months of this year that he was going to come back and finish what he started. 


He accepted a plea deal and is on probation, and will not be facing jail time. I gave a Victim Impact Statement about what happened and was able to call out him and his family.



The aftermath and the court proceedings took 6 months and essentially took 2 and a half years of my life. He drove a wedge between me and my family and all I can do now is work to move forward from this experience. I‚Äôm seeing a counselor and I am working to take back my life. I‚Äôm suffering through PTSD and I am just hoping to move forward in my life. I hope to share this story not to get notoriety, but to find support for this.

domesticviolence,"I‚Äôve been having a really hard time dealing with what conspired 3 days ago. A person I looked up to all my life, put on a pedestal even, showed me his true colors. 
I‚Äôve had no choice but to replay the incident over and over again. The tension building up to the slap that threw me across the room. He is 280lbs and 6ft 3‚Äù and I‚Äôm a little under 160 and 5‚Äô9‚Äù. He told me that the way I was talking to him felt equally to the slap I received and that‚Äôs when I finally saw it. He‚Äôs stuck in this cycle of battering and I‚Äôm his victim. He thinks he could hit me then text me the next day asking if I‚Äôd like to hang out and grab dinner. This was after he had already gave an ‚Äúapology, but‚Äù speech. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs hit me over something minimal, but I thought that... no it can‚Äôt be. Not the one who always controlled the meltdowns my mom had growing up. Now I see you were the cause of those meltdowns because you‚Äôve obviously been gaslighting anyone you feel threatened by. Well I‚Äôm done. 

It started with you threatening to hit me because I wasn‚Äôt listening to your direct order. I then said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that because I‚Äôll call the police if you do anything‚Äù  then the fire lights up in his eyes. He hits my arm, I push him and call him an ass hole then he slaps me across the head (I guess my brother compared it to him hitting my dad and my dad moves, they‚Äôre about the same size and my brother does sports and stuff so you could imagine the force against my head. 

It‚Äôs so hard though. I have feelings of guilt mixed with anger, fear and sadness . Sometimes a sense of empowerment but it‚Äôs mostly the other feelings, He keeps coming by to the house and I‚Äôm really anxious about it all. (Background he recently moved out because he felt that it would help stop the fighting between him and my mom, now I feel like since I‚Äôve gained a voice he now feels the need to fight with me and bring me down physically.

domesticviolence,"im not sure if this is the right place to post this as im aware its for victims and supporters and i really dont want to trigger anyone.

so i have a friend whos in a pretty bad relationship. i stayed at his for a few days last week, i wanted to stay longer but it was causing me too much anxiety so i made up an excuse to leave early.

i overheard a lot of what him and his wife were fighting about, mainly family stuff which wasnt new, but i overheard that he had hit her (and in her words, multiple times, including when she was pregnant). i wasnt entirely shocked because i know how wound up he can get because of her emotional abuse but i also have never known this man to be violent at all. hes always been kind natured and respectful to literally everyone. also a generally chill guy with no temper except when it comes to his wife. 

i know some of you may not believe me because all of this sounds like he could still be an abuser but hear me out. 

his wife has been emotionally abusive since day 1. but especially after they had kids. she can be very blunt and has always had a problem with his parents  for no reason. shes also generally disrespectful towards his whole family and towards him. their relationship has not stopped going downhill. 

i love this man very much and put so much faith in him. i know he wouldnt hit someone unless he was truly out of control. i also dont want to make excuses for him.

there's a lot i havent written here that would explain so much more (as to why he would do that and giving his wife the benefit of the doubt) but im so scared it could get found and things would get a lot worse.

domesticviolence,"Boyfriend told me he hopes I die (and various other insults)

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 3 years. He has shown his anger before, but it‚Äôs getting worse. On top of this, we have an apartment together so there is never really a way to escape him.
Last month, someone close to me died. Since then, he‚Äôs made no effort to comfort me or ask how I‚Äôm feeling after all of this. However, he has adapted death into his insults to me. (He already verbally abused me prior to this, I won‚Äôt even attempt to deny it.) 
About two weeks ago, he asked me to drive him to his brothers hockey game. I wasn‚Äôt really feeling great, after recently recovering from kidney stones so I told him I thought I would just shop in the local target right by the hockey rink. We called me various insults but the one that stung the most was ‚ÄúI hope you die. I hope you crash your car on the way home and die,‚Äù It was vile and just when I thought it couldn‚Äôt get any worse, it did.
He has now incorporated wishing death on me in his daily insults. I feel trapped because our apartment lease doesn‚Äôt expire until April and I can‚Äôt afford the entirety of the rent on my own monthly. However, I have been saving more money so that as soon as possible I can move into a place on my own and be free of it.
Today he told me to ‚Äúdrop dead‚Äù, last week he told me that I deserve to die. Is he truly that vile that he would begin wishing death upon me as I am going through the grief of losing someone I cared about?
I feel lost, defeated, alone. I‚Äôm ashamed to tell my family and friends about this because I don‚Äôt want to embarrass him. I won‚Äôt bother telling his parents because I‚Äôve gone to them in the past about his verbal abuse and they did nothing.

domesticviolence,"Bare with me here, because it's kind of a lot. 

So, my husband and I started dating in 2011.  We both have mental health issues, and we started out fantastic, but then it shifted. Literally randomly one day, he started treating me like shit, I left him for the first time. But, because I'm stupid I came back about a month later. I was so infatuated with the idea of love, I was willing to do anything to have it, even be emotionally abused. I took it for years, until one day I started sticking up for myself and then shit escalated even more. He started threatening me, getting drunk almost every night, and throwing shit as well as punching walls. Skip forward to 2016, I left him again... I was SO happy. But, a couple months after I left he called me telling me he wanted to join the air Force and if I'd be willing to come to the base where he is stationed so he can see our son (who was 2 at the time).. the last thing I wanted was for him to miss out on what he's worked hard for (he had to get his GED while working full-time) and I was willing to give him another chance because I figured the military would change him. 

Boy-howdy was I wrong. 9 months go by, I've seen him once since he left for BMT (it was his graduation) and our son hadn't seen him at all in that time. You'd think all that time apart he would be happy to see us, nope. He was shitty the whole time he picked us up, and even invited his friends over that same day to chill, but I had been traveling all day by plane with a toddler by myself, which I missed my connecting flight so it was exhausting af. I got upset with him, and told him I just wanted to chill without having to worry about entertaining company. Of course he got shitty and told his friends NVM becuz I didn't want them to come over. Like, cool. So their first impression of me is a shitty bitch. 

Couple months go by, I have to be admitted to a psych ward because I was having suicidal ideations and was close to ending it. When I told my therapist how my husband would react to me willingly going to a psych ward, he called my husband's first Sgt and had him bring me home and waited until the place could pick me up (it was about a 6 hr drive, because that was the closest Tricare accepted facility). The whole time I was in there I didn't have my phone, but his friends told me he went ""psycho"" because he was ""scared for my life"" and he punched the walls right in front of his friends and drank excessively every night.. even though he was caring for our son. I was in there for 9 days, and once again, you'd think he would be happy to see me. Nope. He was shitty for three whole days and didnt talk to me after I got home. 

Then, one night we were at a friend's house drinking and we drove separetly (it was a 10 min walk, MAYBE) I wanted to go home because it was getting late and my son needed to go-to bed. (I didn't even drink tbh) but I took his keys because I told him I didn't want him driving. He walks home, rages at me, cusses me out, calls me horrible names then goes to the garage. About an HR passes so I go-to check on him. He's sitting in the dark on the floor. I turn on the light, and ask him what's wrong. No response. He snaps up, and throws an open knife behind him at me (it was a razor blade knife)... All of me wishes that the blade would have gotten me, and not the handle.. when I told him I couldn't believe he did that he said I had no proof and that no one would believe me. 

I finally get fed up, and I'm motivated and ready to leave him for good (mind you, we are 1200+ miles away from our home town/family) I tell him I want a divorce, and that I was 100% certain I wanted to leave. That same day, me and him got into a really bad car accident. It left him in a coma for 2 weeks, and he couldn't walk for months, and even had to have surgeries months after everything happened. I stayed. I stayed because no matter how much I'm not in love with him, I still care for him and I do have love for him. I began to feel the loving feelings again, and I was happy again. Then, one night he drank. He went on tangents about seeing the other side, and how it's nothing, and asking me if I had ever felt my own mortality. He ended up slamming me against the brick wall outside and choking me.. then speeding off in his truck. I called 911. He got arrested for DUI, but because I was scared I didn't tell them about him choking me. 

There have been a lot of instances that have contributed to all this feeling of hate toward him, but he is getting better. He rarely drinks, and if he does, it's only beer. He's seeing a therapist and taking medication. And he doesn't treat me like garbage anymore.... But, I feel like it's too late. I want to be in love with him. We have shared over 8 years together, we have a son, and a life built. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of counselor we could look into? I can't even be affectionate with him because I don't trust him. I want to again because I know in the bottom of my soul, he is a changed man.","He's changed, but idk if it's enough.",adb71811,2019-12-28 06:24:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/egnbdp/hes_changed_but_idk_if_its_enough/,19,0.86,5,7,1003

domesticviolence,"I have a friend who I feel is in a emotionally and most likely physically abusive relationship. I don‚Äôt want to overstep my boundaries but I feel that it is wrong as a friend to not at least ask or give my input on the situation. 

My friend didn‚Äôt grow up in the best situation so I know for a fact she has abandonment issues and is really naive and prone to abuse. To make matters worse, she disagrees, but her boyfriend is a PEDOPHILE. She met him when she was 15 and he was in his 20‚Äôs and he had sex with her and had her get his name tattooed soon after they met. I have never liked or respected him. 

The first red flag was when  she moved in with him, she consumed ALL of her time around him and worrying about what he was doing. The second one was when he made her get an abortion and she told me that he kept telling her he wanted a family with her, but as soon as she gets pregnant, he tells her to abort. That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Then she has his name tattooed 4 times on his body, he has 0 of her name. And even if he did I don‚Äôt understand why someone needs to have someone else‚Äôs name tattooed that many times. It looks like BRANDING.

Then over the course of their relationship he has cheated on her, left her for someone else and kicked her out, brought her back and she didn‚Äôt hesitate to take him back and move in with him.

I'm not even sure where to start. I have a member of my family who is a police officer and step father to two young girls, bio dad to their half sister toddler, and married their mother this year. On Christmas, the children were being loud and there was an argument over toys which ended in the eldest (7) being sent to her room to play with her new toys alone. Her step-grandmother went to check on her and found her crying. 7y/o asked why her step-dad was so mean to her, why he would marry her mom if he didn't like children, and then disclosed that he has been hitting her with a broom. No one saw this incident but everyone has seen him be verbally and emotionally abusive to all the children at many of the family gatherings and we are aware that 40% of police officers are abusive.  Step-grandmother is trying to find a private moment to talk to the girls' maternal grandmother and to seek her input. 

What are our options here? We worry that any traditional reporting options will end with him just getting a slap on the wrist and then taking it out on the children. He refuses to go to therapy because it could hurt his career.

domesticviolence,"I originally posted this to the relationships subreddit and it was deleted and they suggested I post here. If I'm being honest I don't feel like I belong here but maybe I am still in denial/shock. I'm going to copy/paste my post from relationships:

&amp;#x200B;

I (34f) started dating my (now ex) boyfriend (28m) over the summer, and honestly thought he was near perfect. He doted on me, would buy me flowers and meals, really treated me the way everyone wants to be treated. Our sex life was awesome, we got along great and had the same sense of humor, had a lot of things in common and could actually talk to him about my interests. I really thought I had found my soulmate.

But last night, we went to a christmas party and he was acting kind of weird all night. I don't know if he was cranky or what, but he would mutter under his breath kind of talking shit about something someone was saying, so that only I could hear it. We were kind of bickering about this and he said he was ""passionate"" and that I should just accept that, but I said or maybe you should work on yourself and try to grow and be better. He didn't like that. He stormed off a few times to smoke a cigarette and while I was engaged in conversation with some people I had just met, I saw him angrily grab his jacket and start to leave. I caught him at the door and asked why he was leaving me there and he said he was tired and wanted to go home, so I went with him. He kept asking me if I was mad at him, which I wasn't, but he kept asking and it started to get on my nerves which upset him more.

When we got home he kept insisting I was mad at him, which I wasn't, and really just kind of throwing a temper tantrum. I said I need to get the pot roast started so we have food to eat tomorrow and started to walk away from him and that's when he started being verbally abusive, saying ""fuck you"" and ""no one will ever love you like I do"" and just mean, nasty stuff. So I asked him to leave, and as he was walking out the door I grabbed his jacket and tossed it to him, then he turned around and basically started picking me up and throwing me around my apartment. He backed me into a corner and just glared angrily at me. I thought he was going to hit me. I was yelling at him to stop which he finally did. When I could escape, I ran out of my apartment and up a few flights of stairs, hiding from him. I could hear him shuffling around my apartment yelling at me to come back. After about twenty minutes I heard the back door of my apartment slam shut and I finally came back to my apartment. My poor dog was hiding under the covers of my bed, and he was so scared he had pissed himself.

He started texting me shit, so I blocked his number. We were supposed to spend the whole day together, we had this big plan. But instead I ate my pot roast alone with my dog and got drunk off mimosas pretty early in the day and slept the rest of the day. He came by my apartment this morning, but I didn't answer the door. Now that a day has passed since it happened I feel very dumb and numb. I think I'm in shock. I know it isn't my fault but I somehow feel responsible? Like were there red flags all along I couldn't see because I was wearing rose colored glasses? I really thought I knew this person and I am having a hard time reconciling the person I saw last night with the person I fell in love with.

domesticviolence,"Hi, this is my first Reddit post and im not exactly sure how or where to start, so I guess ill just write whats on my mind, sorry if the story is kind of messy. My sister has been very abuse for nearly 10 years, shes about 26 now and it started when she started to drink and hang out with rough people.  She was first physically abusive and would hit and threaten to have people beat us up or something, but after getting physical she was arrested once and now resorts to emotional and verbal abuse. She attacks all of our insecurities and emotional flaws and physical traits, she makes it very personal and gaslights every single day.  We used to think she had bipolar disorder and had trouble controlling her anger, but we know from her friends that she is able to control her mood swings and they arent even mood swings, she gets triggered very easily and lashes out on everyone around her, including her son which ill get to later. My family was physically, emotionally, and even sexually abused by my father, I got lucky by being so young so I didn't get any, and we've all got depression and some other issues to work with and fix and we've all seen therapists and gotten help for the family. She alone has refused all help and stays secluded, attacking anyone for trying to help or just leaves and disappears for a few days with friends and comes back high or drunk. We believe she has some issues from the past she isnt working out but she also warps reality and makes lies up and believes them, so I honestly dont know what is wrong with her at this point.  3 years ago she had a child with an abusive boyfriend who is now out of the picture, we've been taking care of her son on the most part especially when he was young because she was consistently in and out of jail for periods of months. Now she uses him as a meat shield literally and tries to hide behind him when she causes fights or issues and plays the mom card when authorities or legal rights come up. (Before i forget my mother/his grandmother has rights as well, got them while my sister was in jail.) She's had times where she'd lose patience with him and start arguing or yelling at him like he's an adult, tells him to leave her alone while he's calling out to his mom, he just turned 3 a month ago btw, or when he'd have fits like all kids do (his are pretty rare), she'd sometimes put him in her room n close the door till ""he calms down"". We'd intervene and try to help anyway we can but then she'd have another fit about trying to control her and intervene in her life, its her son so she can raise him however she wants. We've had DCF involved before and she would play the sweet mother long enough for the case to be closed and nothing to be done. Also im sorry if this story jumps everywhere, im really upset right now so im kind of unfocused. She is currently looking at potential prison time because she had an altercation last year the day before Christmas where she assaulted me, my sister, my brother and my mother. The court date keeps being moved back, and she wasnt supposed to come home but she came back for a shower when she got out, never left. I think my mother doesn't want her to leave because she has no where to go, she burnt all her bridges and has no friends, no family members even cousins want anything to do with her. The rest of my family is done though, me included and we dont want her repeating what our father did to her son, he's already become so used to her starting fights and yelling over stupid things.    
Im sorry im kind of ranting at this point, but does anyone know if there are any legal actions I can take or any resources that help in sibling domestic violence if this counts? I have checked n called multiple places but they only help in intimate domestic violence typically. I just want her out of house and/or my life and away from my family.","Really violent and emotionally/verbally abusive older sister, any help?",DepressedChickenNug,2019-12-26 17:33:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/efy8vy/really_violent_and_emotionallyverbally_abusive/,5,0.75,2,9,740
domesticviolence,"As I have reflected over the years, I think that my family life growing up primed me for a relationship of domestic violence later. My mother was extremely emotionally abusive, neglectful, and maybe mildly physically abusive. When I was 12, she died and my brother who is 1 year older, took up the mantle and became very abusive towards me. He was extremely controlling, manipulative, and threatening. Memories I have of him include locking myself in my room to try to get away from him while he smashed my door in, and him dragging me by the hair and throwing me down on his floor in his bedroom. When I was 21 and 5 months pregnant, my brother hit me so hard that I had to go to urgent care and get stitches.

My dad's role in all of this was to try to be passive and pretend it wasn't happening. On the occasions that I told him about my brother's abusive behavior he would tell me that I needed to stop fighting with my brother and we needed to make up and get along. Getting married young was an attempt to escape all of that. Of course, it didn't pan out and led to a marriage characterized by domestic violence. Later I escaped the marital violence and dysfunctional family through academia. I moved away with my baby who I got sole parental rights over, and completed two BAs, then worked for 3 years before completing a master's from a top university in another country. It was really tough because during my first semester my aunt (my dad's sister) who had been in a domestic violence situation, was found dead in her home. I took it really hard and found it difficult to find the time to grieve between academics and motherhood.

On 12/24 I arrived at my dad's house with my son who has just turned 9. We need to live at my dad's house for a bit while I figure out what's next. My brother and his wife live in town but not at my dad's house. My brother has been pushing for a while now to have a relationship with my son, which makes me uncomfortable. But we have already missed most of the family Christmases since my son was born, in an effort to stay away from my brother's toxicity. This time I tried to tolerate my brother's presence so we could have Christmas together. But my brother kept calling my son names. He would do it like he was being playful or good-natured and not accompanied by a display of anger. I was not okay with it, but took some time to contemplate it and observe that it was in fact a pattern. 

The worst name he called him was ""jerkwad."" It made me angry when he said that, but it was what started me contemplating and observing rather than immediately reacting. Yesterday we all went to a family friend's house for Christmas dinner. My brother addressing my son said ""You little..."" and then stopped himself. I told my brother that he needed to stop calling my son names. He asked what name he had called him. When I explained the pattern citing examples, he stated ""If you don't like it lump it."" I then said, ""My other option is to keep him away from you."" My brother replied, ""Have fun."" So I felt at that point that my best option was just to leave, as I can't tolerate my brother continuing to call my child names and put him down. My son, however, desperately wants family around, so I feel really bad that we had to leave, and that I keep feeling that our best option is to stay away from my family. And it makes me angry that my brother gets to stick around and enjoy lasting friendships and family holidays and community while we don't get those things because a) he is abusive so we have to leave, and b) everybody tolerates him which allows the situation to continue in his favor.

Am I in the wrong to have left the Christmas celebration? Because the silence from friends and family on the matter is feeling deafening.",I moved back home after 7 years.

Due to my deteriorating mental state At my family's house . The inability to say no to any demand . Depression shutting downs and anxiety . I couldn't save Enough to immigrate but I did have enough savings to move out in Kuwait and hire a lawyer. And I did, I learned to choose my self my safety and happiness matter . It's no longer my job to fulfill Thier expectations . Honour the dead opinions of how we should live 
I choose myself . And I prevailed.
In my good bye voice note message to them , I had the upper hand .there is no law against domestic violence but there is a social price 
I used to care enough to protect Thier reputation from my Western lifestyle. 
Thier abuse eroded my love for them slwoly 
They become people I am related to and happend to be born Thier . So in my message I said if you ever cross my path hurt me or stop me I will announce it to the world . I will use social media and newspapers to tell the world what you did and I can do it 
 Don't hurt me and I won't expose you .
Got death threats for two months and then it stopped . They got over trying to fix me or discipline me.
I never got a real apology from them 
And the one brother that said sorry while crying managed to step on red lines again so they are all blocked expect my mom

I  traveled I saw the world 
I found love . A partner that understands cares and loved me in a healthy way . Healthy love 

I was loved more in one year then I did in 25 
I am learning about myself .
I am correcting bad habits I accumulated to survive
I am happy now yes there are some setbacks 
I even fell to depression this year 2-3 months apart 
And all of it relate to emotional wound oozing 
Its a process 
In my worse days now I am still safer and better off then a regular day back with them 
I am happy 
I am.hopful 
I actually wanna live

domesticviolence,"Before I begin I would like to apologise if I'm just vastly overthinking this situation. I really don't want to undermine the suffering endured by people on this sub. 

My mother is sleeping downstairs and my father is sleeping alone in the master bedroom. My sister was reduced to tears and I was left shaking with anger on christmas evening. 

All 4 of us are in the living room. My mother is sorting through the recordings on her DVR. There's a show that we just watched that she recorded so she's about to delete it to gain some space. My father intervenes and orders her to keep it. My mother asks why in a completely non aggressive tone. My father begins to raise his voice at her ranting towards her about hogging the TV. He starts aggressively and repeatedly demanding the remote from her in a deep assertive tone. She eventually surrenders it where he deletes some of her other recorded shows out of spite. My father continues to verbally abuse and gaslight her until she leaves the room crying. He storms upstairs to his bedroom. My sister is in tears and I'm shaking with rage focusing on not following my father and throwing all my strength at him. 

Tonight he singlehandedly turned a peaceful christmas evening into chaos. Something from nothing. There was no preexisting motive behind this. Low amounts of alcohol. It just came out of the blue. This has happened more than once before. 

I've been left confused as to how I should react. Is this a warning sign for further more serious abuse? Am I completely overthinking this. I have aspergers syndrome so I apologise if this post if complete garbage as a result of my potential overanalysis. I just want to keep my mother and sister safe and stable.

I know he abused the girl before me and two of the girls after me because they reached out to me and last I heard he moved to FL and got engaged. He‚Äôlk never change and I don‚Äôt doubt he beats his fianc√©.

domesticviolence,"Hi everyone, I'm new to reddit so let me know if there's any mistakes and I'll try to correct it. Sorry it's so long.

I want to preface this by introducing the concept of intersectionality. It's the idea that I'm in my current situation because of a mixture of identities (only child, female, Asian but born and living in New Zealand, 20yrs old, and Christian). Because of these things, the solution isn't really an easy option of just leaving home and cutting off contact with my parents.

Back in the summer of 2017/18, I had one of the worst periods of my life. At the time, it was the end of my first year of uni and 18 years old. My parents didn't want me to get a boyfriend until I was in my final year. I met a guy, fell in love, and my parents found out. That summer was horrible because they made me break up with him, confined me to the house for 2-3 months, and took all my devices away. I was almost completely isolated from everyone and had to suffer lectures/rants about what a bad Christian I was. At one point I was going to pack my things and leave home but my mum cried and asked me not to leave so I didn't end up doing it. I felt so hopeless, was depressed, and vowed to myself never to feel that hopeless or controlled again. 

After that period, we kind of came to an agreement that as parents they could give me advice but I would have the final say in what I do. Our relationship mended and things have been pretty good until now.

Fast forward, so a couple months ago my mum was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. She's been getting chemo and doing ok. On Mon 23rd she told me to do the dishes at 11pm. I wasn't really happy because it was late and she had been cooking so there were more dishes. I did most of them until the drying rack was full but left some. If I really wanted to, I could've washed them and put them in this other container to dry but I didn't.

Tue 24th morning was my mum's last chemo session and the night before she told me she wanted me to drive her. The night before I was kinda whining about the whole thing because I was washing dishes really late and my mum wanted me to drive and do all these chores without spending any fun time together e.g. playing scrabble. I had been bored out of my mind since the university is closed for break and it kinda felt like she was taking me for granted. 

So she was probably mad about some dishes being left over and that I was whining about driving so assumed I didn't want to go. I didn't mind going but just wanted my dad to drive. Anyway on Tue morning no one woke me up and they had left by the time I got up. She sent me a passive aggressive text saying she was disappointed with me, how she'd never do it to her own mum if she were my age, how I'm not showing Christian love, etc. When they came back, I could tell my mum wasn't happy from her tone of voice when she told me to bring the groceries inside so avoided her.

Wed 25th, I told my dad I was going to church then there was an event so I might be back around 3. In the past, my mum had said I need to tell at least one of them where I'm going and what time/ when I'll be back. Had a great time and came back at 4:30. Last night I got more texts from her saying I'm out of order, how I MUST tell them if I'm going out, how she expects to hear why I was late, and next time if I don't tell them, then I can't go. Then I got another one saying how I need to remember the rules otherwise I can get cursed (wtf?).

I was pretty shocked and asked my dad about it. He seemed pretty shocked too and said try not to take it to heart because she's disappointed with me not coming to chemo. Turns out he had forgotten that I told him I'd be back around 3 and didn't tell my mum. So last night I told him about my plans for today, Fri, and Sat so he'd have all the times.

 Then this morning my mum went on a rant and was yelling at me for so many different things that had happened- dishes, missing chemo, not saying in advance I was going out then when I said I did tell dad, she said it was unusual and that I usually tell her so it's because I'm going around her and getting the green light from him instead, said I was a sh\*tty Christian, etc. (In the past, she said I just needed to let one of them know.) Then she said I can't go on the trip today. 

The texts and rants I can kind of ignore but I swore to myself I wouldn't let anyone control me like that horrible summer I had, plus we had that agreement where I'd have the final say/ control over my life. Saying I can't go on the trip was like undoing all of that. I tried talking to my dad but he's useless at talking to my mum and suggested I leave it so I didn't end up going today but I think I'm going on my planned outings Fri and Sat (hopefully fingers crossed).

The thing is, I didn't fully realise until recently that what they were doing (verbal abuse and controlling where I was going) is counted as family violence. It kinda seemed normal in Asian families and that it was a fight but not abuse. Today I submitted an online non-emergency police form because I wanted to know what my options were but then got a phone call saying they wanted to send police to my house to get my statement or for me to come to the station. I kinda panicked and withdrew the form because it seemed like too much action too soon without knowing what the processes and options were. 

I don't want to be controlled (I'll see how my planned outing tomorrow goes) but at the same time, I can't afford to leave home (I could afford it financially if I wanted to but it's the time and effort it would take). I've just finished my bachelor's and I'm doing honours next year. I live for free at home and if I left, I don't know if I can work part time since honours is intense. Not to mention how much work it would take to find somewhere to live and learn to live on my own i.e. do all of my own chores. Also I don't know what belongings I can legally take since they bought almost all of my stuff (would def need my laptop and clothes). Apart from that aspect, I think family is also a big part of being Christian so I don't really want to cut off ties or ruin the relationship. 

I think I'll have to endure her bad mood until it blows over. I'm very academic and highly involved in uni life so I can't afford something happening this coming year. Maybe if something bad happened after I had a job (after honours), I can consider moving out. At the moment, I've emailed a couple organisations to ask about counselling/advice so I can find out about my options and explain the situation without it getting out of hand. 

Any suggestions and advice are very welcome! I would love to hear if you have similar stories where it's almost 'tolerable' or it's not obvious/ hidden by culture etc and how you dealt with it.","Not sure what to do, advice please",hannah52354,2019-12-26 05:21:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/efrbrh/not_sure_what_to_do_advice_please/,3,0.67,1,7,1333
domesticviolence,"So, I got the call no Mom wants to get at 5am this morning. My daughter called because her boyfriend beat her up. He was drunk, fighting with his friend. She tried to stop him and he turned on her. He hit her in the head. Blood everywhere. She kicked him out, called the cops. He's arrested. Her son and his daughter were there. He's in jail. She's filing a restraining order after Christmas. His daughter is still there. My daughter is fine with that. I think we should send the daughter to her grandma. I feel like that's the safest option for both the child and my daughter. My daughter kicked him out so he's jobless and homeless. He'll most likely go back to grandma when he gets out anyway. It's just a convaluded situation. I'll be honest. I don't want there to be any reason for him to come back to the house. I'm a survivor myself and know how bad things can get. Maybe I watch too much true crime. Sending the daughter to grandma means sending her out of state, so that could be an issue. She's 13. I'm willing to pay for the plane ticket to get her there.

A year ago my ex held me down on the floor by my throat, choked me, punched me in the face almost dislocating my jaw, and then held a knife on himself threatening to slit his wrists in front of me. When I read what I typed those voices of ""Oh it wasn't that bad you need to stop being so dramatic"" still ring out ... and to be honest it's still a struggle to remind myself that no ... it actually was THAT bad and I have every right to my emotions. After that night I left the next morning and my ex started smear campaign to win people to his side before news of what he did got out. A few weeks later after attempts to frame me for damaging his car I decided enough was enough. I filed a restraining order and a warrant was issued for his arrest. We went to court about two weeks later and that very quickly became one of the most difficult and trying days of my life. I remember standing in front of him and his lawyer in a courtroom and right before going up he was taken aside and told to turn himself in. He went to jail and after that I left straight from the courthouse to go to the airport to celebrate my friends birthday in NYC. I remember shaking constantly for the next 8 hrs.

Flash forward one year later and sometimes memories of that night still come flashing back. It all happened at our Christmas party, so sometimes seeing Christmas lights or commercials or hearing holiday songs takes me rushing back. I'm trying to take back the holidays for myself and for my family and friends but I'm not going to lie it can be tough. I finally got out of the city I was living in that I hated so much and moved to my dream city. In the past year I've traveled all over the world and I made it a point to do it completely on my own. No friends, no partners, just me in completely new and unfamiliar places where I knew neither the language nor anyone there. It was in all those countless moments of walking down a street alone, connecting with kind strangers thousands of miles from home, and crying in the street and then brushing my shoulder off, standing up and keeping walking that I rediscovered all the little parts of myself that I realize he was never able to completely take away and that stayed hidden, protected deep inside me. 

I've started seeing someone. I don't know where things will go, but I know that he makes me feel safe and valued and happy and I'm trying to take it slowly one step at a time. There are definitely moments where I feel so much anxiety being with someone new and giving love another shot that it makes me feel sick. But he told me I should take all the time I need and to be honest that's pretty dope. I'm trying to teach him to love me the way I want to be loved and treated and just remain open with him ... but gd do i feel insecure and anxious sometimes. I talked to him some about that too and he reminds me that I've been through a lot and he wants to win me over the right way and I think that's pretty cool. 

I know this is kind of a long update and i dont want to spiral into babble, but I just wanted to say how magical and how much of a roller coaster this past year has been. I've discovered strength in myself that I didn't even know was there. I know for some of you still in abusive relationships or recovering from recent trauma that it might seem like the road ahead is dark and bleak, and I'm not going to lie to you there are shitty days and sometimes recovery really fucking sucks, but it really does get so so so much better. And each of you, all of us, deserves to live a life of joy and peace filled with authentic, irrefutable love. Happy holidays to all of you and sending you all of my love &lt;3

In 72 hours I had to leave my career after a huge promotion, leave a place I just started calling home, and spend every last cent to my name to get back to my family. For a brief moment, I was ashamed. I felt like I failed. I felt like my life was ruined. But I was so wrong. I feel so empowered, and I finally recognize my strength. In the time I had in this relentless city: I found my passion, adopted and saved a dog at risk, and solidified faith in myself. 

In about October, i was being abused by a partner. 

Well. It happened again. And now that the cloud cover is gone, I see things were a lot worse than they really were. 

Before I start my story, I‚Äôd definitely like to give a trigger warning****

We started dating in late June, and moved in together almost immediately. Starting August I noticed that he was getting very aggressive with sex. Asking me to explore things I‚Äôve already tried and haven‚Äôt liked. He‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúOh well, you haven‚Äôt done it with me.‚Äù He pushed and pushed and then guilted and guilted. 

Then the pestering got worse. He would legitimately poke/jab at my vagina or asshole when I would get up or sit down. Any time we‚Äôd cross paths in the house I would get grabbed at, poked or pinched in my most sensitive areas. I was never really embraced when getting into bed or to sit down to relax. Poke. Pinch. Grab. I tried to stop this as quickly as possible and brought it up immediately. He‚Äôd apologize, agree that it was wrong, then start back up a couple days to a week later. 

As I am a disabled woman with am invisible disease, I didn‚Äôt always outwardly show I was in pain. My sex drive got really low from not only the poking and prodding, but my illness as well. So, a lot of times if I had free time, I‚Äôd be trying to relax or sleeping. Our sex life went from pretty frequently to almost nothing. Rejecting him was hard because he would get so angry. Then when we would have sex, he would go three to four rounds.... I would always be the one to stop everything because it would almost always get to a point of pain. He would get to angry if I had to stop him and Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt get him to stop so I‚Äôd just let him finish to avoid the conflict. He seemed to always be proud of sending me to work on Monday after a whole weekend of plowing. 

At first it was kinda fun and hot. But then the teasing got fucking worse. He‚Äôd got public with the poking and prodding. Reading his hands down my pants or skirt at the grocery store. Or ‚Äújokingly‚Äù pushing my head down to his dick. Or ignoring the pleads to stop. I felt like if I wasn‚Äôt serious enough. When the teasing would happen it‚Äôd make me jump or jolt or squeak or even laugh. I should have just screamed at him right there whenever it happened. 

December 8 was my escape. We went to go get a Christmas tree the day before despite all the fighting, we agreed to continue trying. We finished getting all our decorations up. And something clicked. Our fighting got to the point of me getting into survival mode. I shut myself and my dog in the guest room for a few hours. He continued drinking (he ended up finishing one six pack of 8% cider and one of 6% cider, a half of a fifth of my special occasion rye and whatever cocaine he had in the other room) he was banging at the door and calling me just so we can have a ‚Äúdiscussion.‚Äù I said no. I‚Äôm done. We both need to cool off. We both have work in the morning and need to talk about this when he‚Äôs sober. He ended up kicking the door in, breaking the latch. Grabbed me by the neck to bring me outside. I fought back hard. He grabbed my dog and threw her across the room. (A 50lb year old Pitt Bull that i just LITERALLY JUST rescued.) she ran right to me and I got her behind me. We got into another room as and I called his mom for help. 

I didn‚Äôt call the cops because before when I‚Äôve seen him this bad he threatened to hurt himself if I called the cops or left. 

She talked to him and he came back to the locked door I was in. Banging on it and screaming at me. I started trying to get somethings ready and get my dog in her leash. I was able to get my phone charger, tablet, wallet, dog necessities like poop bags and some trainer treats I had. I at this point heard his gun cock. He kicked in the door I was behind. I had a straight shot to the front door and to my car. Just had to go through him...

Calmly tried to get him to give me the gun and that wasn‚Äôt necessary. He took my car keys from my hands, and something just clicked in me. I swung my backpack at him as hard as I could and ran for the door. He grabbed at the leash, but luckily my doggie is strong as hell and pushed through with me. We got right into my car which was always unlocked. It‚Äôs not quite a run away car... it‚Äôs old and carbureted and it was around 35 degrees outside.... and also 5am. He grabbed my door and kicked it open. Then he yanked down on it and bent the hinge out of the door. I just kept my eyes forward, calm... trying not to flood my car... cold start.... i reach over and lock my passenger door where my dog is sitting, and then car finally starts. He runs to the front of the car and I was able to get my door shut. 

Almost free. I maneuver backwards and out to the street. (Because I am a fucking badass behind any wheel. Hahah, super proud of how I flipped my car out of the parallel parking spot I was in. I‚Äôm a practiced rally driver and professional auto mechanic.) 

I start driving. I‚Äôm free. Just don‚Äôt know where to go. I park a couple miles away to plan. During the escape his mother had texted me:

 ‚ÄúYou okay? He‚Äôs just mad that I know (which I already did), and he can‚Äôt pretend he‚Äôs fine, and I won‚Äôt idly by and pretend it‚Äôs not all on him. He‚Äôll calm down, but he may have already done the damage to you. I‚Äôm so sorry. And PLEASE get that dog out of there. He‚Äôll beat the crap out of her.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt home at the time but I went to her house to park for a few hours before I could get to work. My mom and I began planning. I was already about to fly home to visit for Christmas in a week and a half. And I decided I wasn‚Äôt returning to that state.

My mother calls me 20 minutes later. She had booked a flight and would be there at 10:30am the next morning. We decided that my dog and I needed out.

Got to work at 7:30. I told my boss that I‚Äôm planning on leaving for my home state in 72 hours for mine and my dog‚Äôs safety. My boss(who has known me for four years and him for ten) called a police officer and encouraged me to press charges. Because his two other marriages ended this way as well. Abuse the wife. Beat the dog. And they leave. The truths of his past relationships and past dogs started coming out. About 10:30 the cop and I were done and I left for the court house. 

My job is a mile and a half away from our house and by 11am I got call from my coworker saying to avoid the block because he was standing outside my work across the street just staring.

Got a court order restraining order for myself and work place. 

Five days later, I‚Äôm on the road with my mama and doggie - 1,192 miles away as I write this. Still haven‚Äôt slept much. I‚Äôve been doing most of the driving because it‚Äôs a good distraction. 

2,000 miles away is where I start my healing.",A long one. I just want to heal.,eat_m3,2019-12-23 08:14:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eehrit/a_long_one_i_just_want_to_heal/,5,0.92,18,8,1423

domesticviolence,"hello, I am thinking crazy thoughts today - my therapist influenced me to get a restraining order in April. Then my ex filed for divorce a week later. The past few weeks I have been so super depressed because of the holidays and my family of origin is crazy and dysfunctional. My ex has my kids today and I get them back this afternoon. I am debating going to the court to lift the restraining order and fire the lawyers because I don‚Äôt want to go through with this I want to be a family my kids are ages 7,6,3 and it‚Äôs honestly too hard I won full custody of them and he is clean now but dear god I am praying for help to see clearly. Also his ex died a month ago so he has custody of his 15 year old daughter. I want to be a family. I am so depressed. I went to my priest yesterday he said you can‚Äôt put a band aid on dysfunction but we have been together for 10 years I‚Äôve already been through so much like a nervous breakdown and depression and whatever I don‚Äôt know if I can handle this I‚Äôm not suicidal but I can‚Äôt believe like the restraining order just stopped everything in it‚Äôs tracks we have had no closure and life feels too real and too hard and too tough and too lonely not to be together I fought so hard to be a family and I fought so hard to make everything good and I wanted my children so badly! I think my therapist was evil and now she‚Äôs telling me to go on psych meds to get through this time and I don‚Äôt want to because I was on meds ages 14-22 then had a nervous breakdown when I got off of them. So my ex is a high functioning addict who makes a lot of money. The gaurdian at litem was appointed and he said it was the worst verbal emotional and psychological abuse he has ever seen. My dad thinks he‚Äôs a sociopath but I don‚Äôt I just want my family back. Please help me god get through this time. I need so much help. I‚Äôm so sad and sick of being sad I want my life back. I wish my therapist helped me think this through. Matt and I broke up in 2011 and it was the hardest year of my life because I was pregnant and he wouldn‚Äôt speak to me then we reconciled because I got a restraining order back then and then dropped it when I found out I was pregnant. Does this make sense? Anyway he said he wants to divorce me ASAP and would never reconcile with me but we share these 3 beautiful children together please help me. My family of origin is crazy and I‚Äôm seeing them later and don‚Äôt even want to. Ugh. But my dad has heart issues and may die soon so I want my kids to be around him. thanks for reading this jambled mess it probably doesn‚Äôt make sense if you have insight or questions please let me know I feel wild today and I don‚Äôt see that therapist anymore because I don‚Äôt want to go on medication",‚ÄúChristmas miracle‚Äù,cbdlover123,2019-12-23 15:10:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eelr67/christmas_miracle/,1,0.67,1,2,548
domesticviolence,"a friend made a post about being pressured into sex on fb. It was just a meme about it not being real consent if someone gives in after a lot of pressure. Some guy then made comments about how HE would never give in no matter how much pressure and people who did were WEAK and FAILURES. He then made a second comment sayng ""this post is lame as fuck"".

I made a comment saying that ""pressure"" didn't just mean being asked over and over again but could involve threats of them doing nasty things and other psychological abuse. I didn't want to get into it more as I felt I would be wasting my time and making myself vulnerable but his attitude made my blood boil.

People who haven't been in abusive relationships don't understand the dynamics at all. My ex was really nasty when he was drunk and after we had a baby together he would try to bully me into anal sex (or just regular sex). He would threaten to leave the house and go down the road and either have sex with a prostitute or with a girl that he had been flirting with. Like literally just leave and go a few houses down and do these things. He would also say horrible things about me. If I said I wanted to split up he would tell me that I would end up homeless as my housemate was his friend, and the housemate would pull out of the house. In the end, after he tried to kill me and I called the police, that is exactly what happened so it was a realistic fear. 

I'd just like to see how mr ""YoUrE a FaIlUrE"" would cope with dealing with an abusive alcoholic at 4am with a tiny baby and an insecure living situation, on a regular basis.

I also know I've read stories here and elsewhere which have been much, much worse and I feel so bad for those people. That guy obviously thinks it's all just ""normal"" sex and someone giving you the come-on and maybe getting handsey and pleading a bit. Even if that was what it was it can grind you down when you're sleep deprived and it happens again and again.

Anyway I just wanted to rant a bit. Thanks.

Edit: my friend spoke to the guy who made those comments and apparently he thought that the post meant when a guy sends a girl a lot of messages on facebook and then they meet up and have sex. Oh to be so innocent ... Apparently he agrees that if someone pressurises yu to the point of feeling unsafe it is rape. I couldn't even begin to describe the psychological abuse and bullying that can be involved so I just called it good and accepted that he's not really a dick after all, just a bit ignorant!",triggered by facebook post about pressure to have sex and consent,easilypersuadedsquid,2019-12-22 23:17:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eebycz/triggered_by_facebook_post_about_pressure_to_have/,2,1.0,9,11,480
domesticviolence," 

TLDR: I don't even know because it's all over the place. I'm just trying to heal in my own way. But he put his hands on me and he doesn't like that I'm being distant as I try to get over it.

My (30F) boyfriend (26M) is... I don't know how to start. Last Wednesday (18 Dec) we enjoyed some wine together. I was a bit buzzed, but he also had a shot of rum and then more wine after. He was definitely pretty drunk. Anyway, we end up in bed and start debating (if you even want to call it that) about the military (I'm ex-Air Force). Well my boyfriend gets riled up. He starts talking loudly and at one point, yelled at me as he walked away to retrieve more wine which caught me by surprise. It was something to the effect of ""THAT'S RIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT,"" which rubs me the wrong way. Whatever. He comes back to the bed with more wine and downs it. I forget how we start back on the topic (which was something he said, drunkenly, ""The reason we haven't had a war on the American soil is because civilians are armed with guns."" Me, being ex-Air Force, of course sees differently. There are also things I cannot tell him about my job because he does not have the security clearance. He says to me that I think I'm so important and that I don't really know anything. Anyway. The back and forth goes on for a bit. I'm getting sick of it, he just won't let it go. He asks me a question, I answer it and then he tries to turn it around on me. Calling me dumb which made me snap. I got in his face and was yelling at him that he asked me to answer a question and I answered. I repeated it a few times. Now, I'm not saying the way I reacted to him calling me dumb was the best way (which has been ""dumb bitch"" in past arguments) but I cannot stand when he does that. Especially when I never resort to calling him out of his name. So I expect the same respect. He gets out of bed at this point and is standing up next to it (he's 6'2 and I'm 5'1) and then stands up on the bed. So we are both now standing on the bed and I don't exactly remember what is being said but he must of called me a dumb bitch because I proceed to snatch his necklace (that I just gave him hours before) off his neck and throw it on the ground. Again, bad on my part.

The rest happens so quick. He shoves my head down into the nightstand, and pushes it into the floor. I have a tiny welt on my forehead from it still. I get up and tell him that I'm leaving and he proceeds to try and stop me, blocking my path. Ugh... it's all too long to go into detail. Basically, he puts me into two choke holds, throws me, pushes me, and snaps my nail off (i'm wearing acrylics and now a good top of my nail is gone. took some real nail with it so that's fun) as he tries to take my phone from me for fear of me calling the cops or someone else. I have bruises on my arms and my lower back. My elbow still hurts from that night. If I reach from something too quick, I get a twinge of pain that makes me retract my arm. My throat was sore the next day from him choking me. It hurt to swallow. I slept downstairs with scissors under my pillow. Oh and the verbal abuse for when he wasn't physically abusing me. Calling me a dumb bitch and a fat bitch (I had a baby and have a little baby weight and have been struggling to get back to my pre-baby) so he knows I'm self-conscious about it.

This is the first time it has gotten this bad. The choking has happened before. Apparently he didn't remember because he was blacked out drunk. I forgave him as he promised it would never happen again. The verbal abuse came first though. Countless times during disagreements he would call me a dumb bitch. I have never had anyone talk to me this way. I have had many talks with him about how that is not okay to do and that I don't do that to him so he should give me the same respect. He has a temper. An Alter-Ego that his friends have named Lenny (who comes out when he drinks). He told me about bar fights he would always get into because of this Lenny and sounded proud of it. I didn't think anything of it until Lenny started targeting me as we got further into the relationship. We have been dating 6 months and moved in together at 4 months (that is a whole story in itself and was much sooner than we were expecting).

I feel like I'm all over the place with this post. I don't know why I started writing. I think I'm trying to heal from that night but I don't know how. I can't talk to anyone I know about it because I don't want them to see him as a bad person. He's very loving, kind, considerate and amazing to my son (who is not his). But these instances where he isn't the man I fell in love with scare me. And so I guess I came to reddit because I don't know where else to go. He hurt me and I'm trying to heal from it. I've been distant and he's been so apologetic. He promised to quit drinking. It has only been 4 days and I'm not over it yet. Am I wrong for that? I'm a bit cold to him when I answer his questions. He doesn't like it and we get into an argument because of it. I've been keeping to myself (playing FFXIV and FF13). He feels the need to call out that it's tense in the house. There's just so much more, but I'm just tired. He has anxieties that I'm going to leave him because of what happened. I told him I won't, but that I'm trying to get over it in my own way and that it won't happen as quick as he hopes. He's also very impatient. And if I do not answer him or react in the way that he is expecting, it becomes a whole thing. Oh and he also turns everything around to be about him. How me being cold to him is making him feel, how the way I am trying to heal is neglecting him, how we should heal together. What makes him think he has the right to criticize how I'm healing? I'm not doing anything mean. I've been very cordial. I just haven't been lovey dovey and I think that is understandable. I just like to be left alone but he keeps pushing the subject. I don't know.

She would try to talk to her friends and he would make her cut off any contact with any guys ( including me ) that weren‚Äôt her family and then he would go on to constantly mock and belittle her for having sympathy and empathy for people. He after a few months would slowly start to stop her from having opinions, thoughts, ideas and emotions. She couldn‚Äôt wear what she wanted ( even stuff that wasn‚Äôt even revealing or anything like that ) she couldn‚Äôt listen to music she liked or watch movies she liked. He then wouldn‚Äôt even let her hang out with friends unless he was there and he wouldn‚Äôt let her talk to anyone without him going through every message even when it was stuff sent to her parents and family members. Then one incident is he went around telling his ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù that she was a slut, ugly, stupid, and horrible at doing sexual things. He once hit her hard enough to leave a black eye because he had given her a choice to go to her fathers funeral or to stay at his house and just get high and when she decided to go to the funeral he hit her to the point of a black eye. He at this point hits her regularly and has almost convinced her to the point of her being afraid to speak or to make mistakes and when she does get beat by him she tries to say that she deserved it and that it was fair. He know beats her regularly and will almost always leave bruises and marks and she‚Äôs essentially being forced to not talk to anyone because of he threatened to shoot her and kill her whole family. I‚Äôve recently just learned about this and I‚Äôve been trying to help her and whenever someone says something about it his excuse is ‚Äúthey are just trying to get with you‚Äù. So at this point I don‚Äôt know what I should do or who I should call or where to go because I don‚Äôt want her to get hurt badly and risk anything awful.

domesticviolence,"  

Dear Reddit community,

I‚Äôm writing this post because I have been searching and searching myself for resolution to my recently ended relationship and I am not finding any peace around it. After being physically attacked for the 3rd time I kicked my ex out of my apartment just 6 months after she had moved in. The violence of the attack was not physically damaging, but it was clearly emotionally triggering. 

Maybe the most emotionally intense component of the last attack was that it happened in public and that was clearly too much for me. As soon as I was able to reign in her excitement to the point where she wasn‚Äôt screaming at me in the street I told her ‚Äúthis is over‚Äù. We went into the apartment and I grabbed her suitcase and her set of keys and told her to get out. She eventually recognized that the harm I felt was very real, and became deeply remorseful (just moments after she was blaming me for her violent response).

She left after six hours of me telling (or shouting at..) her that I wanted her to leave, and her apologizing. Three days later after having some space from the excitement of the situation my nerves were still on end and my anger was still very resonant. We planned to meet in public to talk about whether we could work this out, but I was still very emotionally raw and I was even afraid of seeing her because I didn‚Äôt even trust my ability to not respond violently to her. That didn‚Äôt happen.

Instead, I officially broke up with her and walked away. She moved her stuff out the following weekend without me in the apartment and my dad there acting as an intermediary. 

I‚Äôve read so many posts on this thread that lead me to believe that I did the right thing. All of my friends and family tell me I did the right thing. My (new) therapist tells me I did the right thing. The domestic violence hotline tells me I did the right thing. But, every single molecule in my being tells me that we could‚Äôve worked it out. And even as I write this, four months later, I still wish we could. 

I‚Äôm not claiming any sort of innocence in this scenario. I certainly recognize that my actions triggered her into (what is likely) a traumatic response. But, even in that recognition of responsibility, I can‚Äôt pretend that all of these things were not happening to me in this relationship that are listed as symptoms of dv on most websites:

¬∑ Humiliation

¬∑ Isolation

¬∑ Jealousy 

¬∑ Physical Violence 

¬∑ Blaming violence on me 

¬∑ Coercion

I think I just felt like I had to post now before I try something stupid like texting her, or giving her money to lure her back to me.",Four months later and still no peace,matt_onfire,2019-12-22 19:04:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ee8rpi/four_months_later_and_still_no_peace/,11,1.0,5,7,474

domesticviolence,"This wasn't the first time.

The first time was when I lived with my parents and he was accusing me of messaging some guy, who was my relative and it was completely innocent. We were moving out to a new country and my cousin was marrying a woman from that country. Excited, I asked him about it (we had not talked in many years). I am Pakistani, so my cousin was someone who in the very distant past had shown interest in wanting to marry me to my parents  (I said ew no obv). Anyway my then-fiance was very mad and saying horrible things to me while I talked in a calm tone and he yelled in my room and I felt embarrassed my whole family was going to hear. Then finally I think he called me a slut so I back slapped him and I don't think it touched him only his glasses fell. He proceeded to punch me multiple times in the head and told me never to hit me again. I was devastated. Growing up with my parents abusing me I didn't think my partner would ever do the same, knowing how it has affected me growing up.

That fight was awful I started crying hysterically and trying to push him out of my room and he beat me up completely and then I went to my parents crying and they took his side. Infact my parents screamed at me for yelling at him while I was hysterical. 

It took a lot for me to forgive him but I did. He had no remorse in the begining but eventually broke down and said he had a lot of growing to do. I asked him if he ever hit any other woman in his life he said no.


Fast forward, we moved out and we are living in a new country. I don't remember how the next fight happened but it was similar and he again aggressively held me down. 

The third time I was running and crying because of his horrible things he said about me being desperate to meet my friends (all girls who had invited a guy to hang out with them and they wanted my husband to meet him). I ran into the other room saying I wanted to die and he ran to hold me down from hurting myself then I pushed him away and begged him to just leave me alone. He wouldn't so again I pushed him and he punched me hard in my rib cage. 

This last time was very bad. It was a stupid argument over him being illogical about driving somewhere and I got upset because he used his friend as an excuse and I said its not right because he listens to his friend (who makes no sense) but who also listens to his wife more than anyone else. I got really upset and told him to just leave and stop. He kept following me and getting in my face and I stupidly slapped him. I didn't mean to... But he punched me hard in my head multiple times and it still hurts. I spent all evening crying and he still had the audacity to blame me for stopping him from meeting his friend. I still cooked him dinner and he was trying to be goofy and I told him to stfu in total disbelief as to why he was so happy after that even though he had said sorry it didn't seem right. He said it's because I slapped him first.",I slapped my husband and he punched me in the head,Kimiya12,2019-12-22 11:28:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ee3xtp/i_slapped_my_husband_and_he_punched_me_in_the_head/,12,0.79,8,11,593
domesticviolence,"I know a lot of people will say to instantly break up. 

So my boyfriend has had a history of medical issues resulting in him never learning to drive. He's great in so many ways, cleans more than I do, etc. 

But tonight I was out Christmas shopping with family. Basically I was driving from town to town til 6 PM. I was tired and just didn't want to drive anymore. He got really mad when I asked him to Uber or bus home. 

I'd made dinner (pork roast, potatoes and carrots) and when he got home he was mad that I didn't pick him up. He ended up slapping my face which knocked my glasses off, and later grabbing me by the throat. 

I know he pays all of the bills, and takes care of me, does honestly way more housecleaning than me,  but I feel like a taxi cab. I'm the one to drive to the grocery store, to pick him up, to run any errands etc. But the one time I don't pick him up (it's a 30 min drive going 70 mph most of the way) I'm a major asshole. Advice?

TLDR my boyfriend got extremely mad because I didn't drive 30 minutes to pick him up after Christmas shopping all day, and slapped me and grabbed my throat

EDIT: also Tuesday I had got a flat tire. I ended up walking home at 10 PM alone, and my teenager brother skipped school the next day to help me change my tire while my boyfriend stayed home alone.

depression,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

i never asked to wonder if i was a normal person. but i now realize there is no such thing.

i never asked to spend countless hours in school crying myself to sleep because i felt that i was worthless. but even though my family was with me the whole time, i didn't seem to notice.

i never asked to be taken to that mental hospital. but i needed it, and somehow, not even that helped.

i never asked to lose my friend after she was forced to relocate to NC after her mother died right in front of her. but i suppose she didn't want that either.

Depression is a lack of energy. 

Lacking the energy and motivation to do the most mundane tasks. From doing dishes, to even personal hygiene like taking showers and brushing your teeth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is Wanting to maintain relationships but also, not wanting to maintain relationships. 

Relationships involve energy. You want to have people in your life but they want to do things like hang out and text and call. Depression makes you not want to socialize. Depression makes getting dressed and ready to go out somewhere like its a grueling task. Even the thought makes you overwhelmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression makes even the smallest inconveniences feel like the end of your world. 

forgetting that a subscription was taking your last 15 dollars out of your account, puts you into a whirlwind of downward spiral. It's not the thing itself that makes you want to die but its what brought up all of your suicidal ideations again.

 

Depression is the everyday longing of not wanting to exist.

Most of the time you don't want to kill yourself. But you sure as hell don't want to be alive. You imagine crossing a road and a bus accidentally wipes you out, and it brings a glimmer of hope that maybe that will happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is needing someone to talk to but not wanting to burden your loved ones. 

You wish you could tell someone all of your deepest darkest thoughts but everyone in your life is dealing with their own issues and you wouldn't want to add yours to theirs. So you stay quiet. Letting it eat you a little more inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is actively telling yourself it will get better. 

When you're in your deepest depression, even thinking ""it will get better"" makes you feel sick, like its some joke. How could anything get better? I'm stuck. There's nowhere to go from here. But you have to think it will get better. You're brain, your innate instinct to survive, tells you to just hold on a little longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meds. They might work some day. You might get the right dosage, the right meds, the correct combination. You might. But then the depression says it takes too long to try. It's so much effort. So much trial and error. The doctors say it takes roughly 30 days for an anti depressant to tell if it's working. That's a month, every time you get a new med to try that ultimately doesn't work... Again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is exhaustion. physical but mostly mental. 

It's being tired of trying. Tired of the fight. Tired of telling yourself the meds might work this time, you're feeling a little bit better. but that turns into false hope and you're right back where you started. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you continue on. Smiling every now and then. Maybe even feeling happiness once in a while. But it's always there. It's always lurking in the background. Waiting, stalking. But you'll get through it right? You have to get through it. Too many people rely on you to be alive.

depression,"TW: suicide, child abuse

It's funny, despite all the hullabaloo about 'mental illness awareness' you see these days I have never felt more alienated. People just simply do not care, in fact, a lot of them think your suffering is funny. Remember Chester Bennington? He put how he felt into his music. People's response was to mock it and make a meme out of it. ""Haha crawling in my skin, amirite?"" What a melodramatic pussy. Nevermind that Chester was molested as a child, an act that causes severe psychological damage that someone will have to deal with for the rest of their life. Obviously Chester did not know true suffering, like when that bitch Becky wore the same green dress as me despite the fact she knew I wanted to wear it, or that time some asshole in front of me was only going 5 miles over the speed limit instead of the 20 I wanted to go. You know, real world problems.

Of course, when he ended up taking his life due to his pain suddenly all these same people were fans who got through hard times thanks to his music. Absolutely sickening. Completely and utterly fucking fake. It's amazing how fake people are. Not long ago they were mocking how he felt, now they were getting those sweet likes and retweets off of his suicide.

People do the same to you. They read your statuses talking about how you're not feeling well and they roll their eyes. But if you were to shuffle off this mortal coil they would have no problem using your death for that sweet dopamine, and, of course, they would be so shocked! There weren't any signs at all. How could this have happened?

depression,"

In 2019 I left an abusive relationship for good. In 2019 I left my toxic home environment for good. I went abroad and found myself ‚Äì outside of abuse and harm. I spent the year learning and growing. I made new friends and had new experiences. I got my first tattoo. After I left such a toxic environment, the skills I had been learning for the past 7 years finally began to work. I could finally comfort myself, appreciate myself and feed myself without hating my body. I finally developed relationships with real boundaries and genuine care. 

In March of 2020, I moved back to the house I never thought I would be in again. I began to hate myself. My own thoughts drowned by the mindless shaming that I experienced. My family filled my room with their unwanted items. I began to feel swallowed with the feeling of being forgotten. Surrounded by unwanted items, I began to feel unwanted. I woke up in pain and I fell asleep in pain. I cried until my head hurt so badly that I couldn‚Äôt move. I watched my dad welcome my sexual assaulter into my home. I listened to my mom as she told me that they loved me, and that this ‚Äì the toxicity ‚Äì was all in my head.

depression,"Hey y'all. This is going to be one of those long-ass posts I don't expect anyone to read; I'm writing this to get my thoughts down without the expectation of an answer. But if you do finish it and have something to add, some words of encouragement, a slap in the face, etc. I would warmly accept that. 

A few things about me, since I'm quite new to this community: I am living in Los Angeles, 29 years old, married, and have a baby daughter. I completed my teaching credential in February but am currently unemployed after an aggressive job hunt this year and several failed interviews. My wife works from home and makes OK money, but we're barely getting by after her post-lockdown pay cut. 

I have been battling depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old and have considered suicide many times but have not carried it through. In March, when the lockdowns first started, I was turned down for a job and had a breakdown. That was the first time I had ever called the suicide hotline and began to take my mental health very seriously. The reality is that I have a family now and can't fuck around with my health anymore. 

I did carry on and got into a daily routine that worked for me. The last couple of months have been challenging, but it wasn't until the past week that I started to get that ""I don't see the point in waking up today"" feeling that was so prevalent throughout my childhood. And I've been trying to figure out why that's happened.

The crux of it, I think, is that **I don't think people really care what I have to say about anything, nor do I suspect they ever will**. The older I get, the easier it is to picture a future where I accomplish virtually nothing of value in my life and have no lasting impact on the world. Which is to say, I'm losing hope.

As I already mentioned, I want to be a teacher. With everything going on in my country, I'm more certain of that than ever. Kids need good teachers with passion and something to say. But will I ever get hired? I don't know. The interviews so far haven't given me reason to hope. I look in the mirror and I see a spindly, weak, boyish-looking 29 year old with bad teeth that can't grow a decent beard and I wonder why *anyone* would want to put me in charge of a classroom. God, it seemed like every fucking day when I was student teaching, someone asked if I was a student. My supervisors thought I did great work and gave me glowing recommendations, but I don't feel like it matters. And I *know* that's part of the problem. It's a cycle of defeat.

The other thing that's beating me down, and I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible, is that a project I've been working on for years - my dream, really - suddenly feels pointless. To me, anyway. 

Four years ago, I got off Lexapro and went into a spiral, so I started re-evaluating what mattered to me. I rekindled a silly dream I had as a kid: I wanted to start my own cartoon show. I contacted an artist friend of mine at college and we made a lot of progress. In fact, we've turned the series into a graphic novel and I'm trying to find representation for it so we can ink it and make some money. The work that has been done on this project has been a major source of pride for me.

But, all of a sudden, with current events being what they are, I don't think anyone wants the story I'm trying to tell. Crucially, the cast is largely white and male, set in a rural portion of America that is often forgotten. It's kind of a...King of the Hill meets Daria kind of thing. I wanted to tell my story growing up in a small town, how the youth of America can overcome racism, sexism, poverty, domestic violence and alcoholism in their communities to become good, upstanding people. How the cycle can be broken. That middle America can be a place of hope, not an anchor dragging everyone else down. 

On paper, maybe that sounds promising. But when I look at how painfully *white* and *masculine* this concept is, coming from a white male, I feel embarrassed. I see what's coming out and just want to shelve the whole thing. Like...who the fuck cares? 

And I suppose that gets to the heart of the matter: I'm not proud of who I am and I don't feel like anyone needs to hear from me right now. My wife and daughter need me, yes. I'm not going to kill myself. I'm going to stick things out to the end. I shudder to think what my life would be like without them. But do I feel strong, meaningful, valuable in a greater context? No. I'm a just a guy, who can't even get a job after all the education in the world, and whatever ambitions I had for the future seem frivolous and wildly unrealistic now. More so every day.

I think that's enough about me for now. If you read this entire thing, thanks a lot. It helped me out just to verbalize some of the really dark, hopeless feelings I've been having lately.","Feeling irrelevant, unmotivated and hopeless",traviud,2020-06-20 09:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcj0lb/feeling_irrelevant_unmotivated_and_hopeless/,6,1.0,7,5,913

depression,"Let me try to explain what makes it such a piece of shit. 

I was born with Fibromyalgia, I was in an accident in 2013 that left me with a broken back, major head injury and hip issues. Since then I have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. They are not sure if I have always been schizophrenic or if it was brought on by the head injury. Since I don't remember most of my childhood now, I can't be sure either. 

Why does it matter? Because every day I wake up in immense pain. Live a 7 on the pain scale. I'm exhuasted and I never sleep. I am confused more often than not. I can't remember anything. Can't hold on to knew information well. I have multiple voices in my head and I hallucinate regularly. 

I had a relationship when I hit my head. A relationship of a solid 7 years. And then all of a sudden I was a different person. He stayed. He tries. But I can see this life takes a toll on him. I'm not the woman he married. How could he love me? I am so different and he now has to endure spending time with my other sides when they decide to take over. (Yes I am aware this is Atypical for schizophrenia, but I have been informed that I do not have D.I.D as when they take over I do not black out, I just cannot do anything to control my movements or speech. )

Over all my life is shit. I can't get a job. My doctor is an ass hole who thinks a 29 year old female with xrays of her broken fucking back is too young to be in pain so he refuses to prescribe me anything go help. Instead I take 6-8 over the counter back pain pills (basically rpbaxacil) and tylenol when I can afford it. Said ass hat doctor won't fill out the disability forms because I'm 29. According to him, it's my period. I live very rural and I don't have any money to travel anywhere. My partner was disabled when we moved in together and is on a fixed income. 

It just feels like Im going to be starving, tired, in pain and broken forever. I just don't feel like life is worth living like this.

depression,"I‚Äôve been dysthymic all of my life, and now coupled with possibly the worst MDD depressive episode I‚Äôve ever experienced, I‚Äôm struggling.

My best friends (we‚Äôre a group of 3) that I‚Äôve known since I was 13 were one of my main support systems. To be honest, I don‚Äôt approach anyone else other than them and my clinical psychologist to talk about my depression. 

I‚Äôm always worried that I‚Äôll become to negative to the point that they have to distance themselves from me, or until they hate me as a person. Still, they always say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be sorry, we‚Äôre always here for you, don‚Äôt feel bad about it‚Äù, and so I tend to take them for their word and reveal my negative feelings to them.

Maybe today they gave up on me. They left me on read. They don‚Äôt fucking care anymore. 

I‚Äôm trying so hard not to be too bothered by it, and not to lash out at them and say something I regret, like ‚Äî ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm sorry I overshared‚Äù, or ‚Äúi guess you guys hate me now‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to be THAT asshole. I know I shouldn‚Äôt expect my friends to be there for me 24/7, and that I shouldn‚Äôt blame them if they need to take a step back. But it fucking hurts and I feel so alone in my despair. With everything else going on, it all feels so overwhelming and I feel like a fucking terrible person. 

I want to fucking hurt myself to get all of this despair out of my system. I want to die. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm struggling. 

1) How do I control myself from lashing out? I‚Äôm literally physically hurting myself right now to stop myself from ruining my friendships / support systems. 

2) What am I supposed to do when my support system doesn‚Äôt want to support me anymore because it‚Äôs all getting too much? What if I‚Äôm too fucking depressed for them?

depression,"
They think I‚Äôm just quiet because I want to be. They don‚Äôt realize that I just don‚Äôt like being around people and THEY‚ÄôRE the reason for that. One of the biggest symptoms for social anxiety is thinking that people are making fun of you all the time. Well I must not have social anxiety because they are making fun of me. Even the people I call my friends. I am nothing more than a joke. So all this leads to me not enjoying being around others. I hate being around other people so much but I do it anyway. Why? Because sometimes I think maybe, just maybe I could have some fun. And it seems that maybe I just wasn‚Äôt ever meant to. It‚Äôs been like this for over a year and a half. I just can‚Äôt be myself (not that I know who that is) and since my life is ‚Äúgood‚Äù to someone looking in from the outside there‚Äôs no way anything can be wrong with me so therefore I must be quiet and antisocial on purpose.

depression,"Recently broke up with my gf of nearly a year. I didn't realize how much I liked her until I got dumped.

I can't stop trying to make light and jokes about things and acting like I'm okay or like I'm a chad who doesn't give a fuck. I can't control it I just lie and retreat into this fuck boy like persona whenever my break up comes up. 

My ex was always shy and pretty tsundere like, almost never expressed her affection in words but usually in the form of a rare grapple to my arm as we study. Always had a fear that she didn't REALLY like me but i kept burrying it because of the joy i had just being with her at the time. 

She was almost asexual making me also feel like she didnt like me, and now that i dwell on it she probably didnt. It wasnt until 3 months of us being a couple and spending the nights together until took her bra off and bit later give me a blow. It was probably out of pity. She never took her pants off and would refuse to change in front of me unless i looked away. I'm more of one to want to give pleasure and this kinda threw me off but i knew she had a lot of insecurities and i always wanted to make sure she was okay so i never pushed her on it. This lack of sexual desire from her led my already low confidence even lower and maybe i was just not good enough. I just wanted her to be happy.

She was an exchange student and eventually she had to back to her home country and I was commited to stay with her and meeting this summer. With covid i couldn't fulfil that and as the months went by i could really feel her distancing herself from me. My messages would be met with short answers and long waits. I even thought that maybe i should break up with her. 

One night she asks if im free and we call as usualy and she says how she feels like she doesn't like me as much as i like her and that makes her feel bad so she wants to break up. Atm i was also thinking the same thing and this is probably the best option and we left off and friends.
Since then no contact but she seems to be the first person to see my stories SMS but maybe thats just my brain. Being broken up and looking back at evrything made me realize that she didn't love me. She never once said ""i love you"" without me asking or saying it first, to which i would just get ""i do"" or ""me too"". 

It really pains me that it seems like I'm always in a one way relationship, maybe im too clingy.

To everyone i act cool about it, but i can't control myself. I'm not okay, I want to feel loved. 

God, when did i become so pathetic. What happned to me. I just want this to end.
I'm leaving a lot out and I really dont want to post this but i can't sleep.

Among other things I've just been extremely anxious about other life events.

depression,"So today I started my day very bad. I was very unmotivated and anxious about all the work I had to do today. Most of my day I was so sad I was just sleeping most of the day even though I had so many things I had to do. I just didn‚Äôt care. I did the usual. Think about suicide and convince myself not to do it, and then think of how happy I used to be and the feel like a piece of shit. 

Then my mom told me today I was going to go out and eat with my family. I didn‚Äôt want to but I didn‚Äôt have much choice. I showered and no joke, a few hours after being with my family made me feel a lot better. It‚Äôs not like I was instantly cured from depression, but I went a few hours without suicidal thoughts and without motivation to live. Granted I still feel sad but much better than before. Especially because when I got home I had the motivation to do my homework. I did days of work in a couple of hours. So in conclusion, be with family and friends even if you don‚Äôt want to. Or do things you like even if you don‚Äôt feel like it.

A term people use to hide and get rid of the evidence of them hurting someone: to hide from them from the thoughts of thinking that they caused it for another person.

depression,"Suicide often comes a feeling of a lack of control and a despair about the seemingly impossibility of recovery from depression. Trying to calm down someone extremely suicidal by saying ""it gets better"" is one of the most tasteless things someone can offer in face of someone's extreme suffering &amp; agony. It's like telling someone on fire that it might rain next month.

However, by affirming the other's suicidal impulse, it gives a sense of control over one's life and genuine acceptance and understanding of the pain one is going through. This actually helps calm down people and get them out a ""fight or flight"" mode. It shows that the person/friend truly understands and empathizes/sympathizes with one's internal torment and that is far more comforting than being told words that a stranger online or on a hotline could easily have reiterated soullessly, or selfishly.

But currently mainstream suicide prevention sums up to ""don't do it.""","The irony is that affirming others' suicidal ideation and being supportive of their right to personal autonomy is a more effective measure of genuine suicide prevention than mainstream ""suicide prevention.""",emilylinhla,2020-06-19 22:29:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcaae9/the_irony_is_that_affirming_others_suicidal/,5,0.98,32,30,153

I could go on a long unnecessary self-centered speel on regrets but I won't, the parts of our past that make us are the ones we give the power to. I gave the wrong parts of mine that power. In short I never really got over you. Not in the since I love you or anything, god we havent talked in 6 years we probably don't even know each other. Hear me out, its more in the sense I never grieved and healed. I never forgave myself for not telling you or anyone how I felt and I think in order to regain my sense of self I need total honesty with myself and the people I talk to. I gave your memory too much power. Im sorry i have to send this, it sounds pathetic even in my head but again its not for you. Its so I can let go of never telling you back then(even tho it was never subtle). I think I fixated on it after we stopped talking because you were the last thing i felt strongly about, which is completely fucked up honestly. Anyway the only sentence that needed to be said here was that back in the day l I had the biggest crush on you, good god you have no idea, honestly it was bad. Sometimes I wonder if I still do and then I remember I can't even tell if I'm sad or happy about something so what the fuck do I know. Its definitely 90% nostalgia and 10% rose colored glasses.

depression,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this. Im scared of missing out and being left behind too. I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I believe that i won't ever have kids or a wife like everyone else . I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls. Most people i know are in relationships and i want one with all of the good stuff that comes along with it because im sitting her fucking lonely, upset , jealous, sick to my stomach 24-7, LIKE WHY DO WOMEN ON TINDER AND IRL HATE SPEECH PROBLEMS???

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours on some nights). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

depression,"Hi. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm depressed now, but up until recently I had been for years. Like all of middle school, high school, and most of college. 

Probably the most noticeable aspect of my depression for others was just how silent I was. I remember sitting in lunch rooms in high school and not speaking a single word even as I sat at a table full of people I knew. This went on for years. I think I now have social anxiety just due to being completely unused to speaking up and sharing with others and being in the spotlight. This exists in every realm of my life. On reddit I hardly post or comment, I never actually tweet, my instagram account is like 6 years old but has 4 pictures. Its not that I don‚Äôt want to use these things. Or that I don‚Äôt want to talk to people and be social. I do. I just don‚Äôt think the things I have to contribute are valuable enough, or I don‚Äôt want the attention that comes with speaking. 

But I‚Äôve been working on it, and I‚Äôm becoming much more confident. So much so that recently I have been talking a fair amount. It‚Äôs felt really nice actually. But that‚Äôs where the issue is. Last week I was talking to my best friend and I knew she wasn‚Äôt listening to me and I pointed it out. She simply said that I talk too much for her to be able to pay attention to all of it. That might be fair. I get that I can‚Äôt have someone‚Äôs complete and undivided attention. It still hurt though. And I‚Äôll occasionally bring up things I‚Äôve talked about or told her in the past few days, but she‚Äôll always say I never actually told her that. But I did, she just doesn‚Äôt listen to it. A person I dated last year literally asked me if I had ADHD because they thought I talk too much. I was just excited and telling a story. Today I was talking to my sister and I could tell she wasn‚Äôt listening to me and I told her about how I feel like no one ever listens to me. Literally as I was saying it she interrupted me and changed the subject. 

I get that its not a huge thing, but it just kind of sucks. I was miserable for years and now that I‚Äôm finally feeling like I‚Äôve made some progress, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs unwanted. It‚Äôs like everyone is used to the depressed version of me and now that I finally feel like I‚Äôm finally making progress I‚Äôm too much. So I guess I talk too much and overshare. Which just feels like no one cares about what I have to say which really feels like no one cares about me. So now I‚Äôm talking less. And I‚Äôm getting worse. And it feels like shit. I guess there‚Äôs not a huge point to this post I‚Äôve just literally ran out of people to talk to about things.

so i am a 14 year old girl from the USA (Georgia)  and I am so tired and depressed because of a few things

1. i am a closet atheist to my Jesus freak christian family (that is also raciest and homophobic btw) and i don't want to come out because i am afraid my family will kick me out and disown me, just leave me on the streets to die   
2. i am also a closet pan-sexual that is in a poly relationship (3 other amazing people that are the only reason I haven't went through with killing myself yet) to my family (my friends know i""m pan but only one knows i""m in a poly)
3. i also sometimes do self harm due to my sever anxiety and depression. I have confessed the anxiety and suicidal thots(heh)  to a therapist  and got meds. i have been getting different kinds of meds and different therapy for a wile (its a year in 2 weeks yay) and none of it has worked so now all i feel is........just sleepy
4. i have migraines that come on with sound, stress, and sometimes i just wake up with them in the middle of the night sooooo... that hasn't been helping my mood at all

i just need to know what i can do to make it a bit better because the thots (he he i'm funny) are getting to be to much and i don't want to leave my partners or my friend (she is more like the sister i never had tbh) i couldn't care less if i left my family (i might do a r/entitledparents post on them) so any advice on if i should come out to my family or other things i can do to help my anxiety  and thots(lols)

About a year and a half ago I tried to kill myself. When I say ""tried"" I mean I got right up to the point of doing it, lost my nerve, and had a breakdown. Many, many rounds of therapy and antidepressants later, I started to feel better. About 8 months ago I quit the antidepressants. I was never great at taking them when I was supposed to anyways, and I was no longer feeling the constant dread and sadness that had crippled me the past few years.

What I didn't realize was that in place of those feelings came nothing. I don't feel. I don't care. I dropped out of college (on the recommendation of the school due to my mental health), and I'm having a hard time getting out of my current low paying job. But I don't care. I don't care about my future.

I went to Europe for the first time last year. Didn't leave an impression on me. I have family members who have died or got put into hospice in the past few months. I don't feel a thing. I've hung out with friends online to stave off my cabin fever. I feel no different during or after our meetings.

So here I am, awake at 3 AM, same as every night for as long as I can remember, unable to sleep and unable to feel.

depression,"It all started last Summer.

I was 19, had finally escaped from an abusive and toxic relationship, and found myself working a new job at a small, failing cafe.

This is where I met Stuart (Not his real name.)

He was 21, charming, funny, handsome, everyone adored him, and - he was my supervisor, and he made it clear that he had the power to fire me (Not to mention the owner of the cafe likely had hickeys on her ass the way Stuart kissed it).

Stuart became my de facto shoulder to cry on as my ex boyfriend continued his attempts to abuse me after our breakup and I struggled with the aftermath of experiencing years of emotional/physical/sexual/financial abuse.

I detailed to him every cruel word, and every violation of my boundaries. Typically, I‚Äôd make jokes about my pain and trauma, quoting ‚ÄúI laugh, because I will cry if I don‚Äôt‚Äù, so I‚Äôm not sure if he took it too seriously. Humor was my coping mechanism.

He was willing to listen to my stories and offer comfort and support, but would occasionally discredit what I said, accusing me of making it up, ‚ÄúOh, he didn‚Äôt really say that‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou make him sound like a villain‚Äù, I remember him retorting.

I also admitted to him my issues with my physically absent father, my body image issues and past struggles with anorexia/bulimia, and low self esteem.

I always have had a problem with oversharing, and looking back I really regret opening up to Stuart the way that I did.

He opened up to me too, about his GAD, his toxic relationship with his ex of five years - their constant verbal and physical fights, their drug use, and their mutual cheating on each other.

Stuart also opened up to me that he, too, endured sexual assault at a young age. He assured me that not all men were like my ex, that he was a nice guy, the exception. I believed him.

Stuart was a big promoter of mental health awareness and therapy, and would constantly spout his insights and what he‚Äôd learn from being a psychology major, and when I told him how I felt quite miserable and hopeless after escaping the abusive relationship and didn‚Äôt know if I was truly depressed, he said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have depression. That would mean you can‚Äôt get out of bed‚Äù. I hid the fact that I felt quite suicidal from him because he talked shit about a girl he had slept with because she cut herself. I don‚Äôt even feel like I deserve to call myself depressed now, because it‚Äôs not like what‚Äôs happened to me was a big deal.

We flirted, I sent him racy pictures in a desperate plea for validation (My ex would body-shame me and I struggled with an eating disorder my entire adolescence). He repeatedly asked me to ‚Äúhook up‚Äù with him. I told him, however, that I could only have sex with someone I was in a relationship with.

In between his declarations of my beauty and sense of humor and intelligence, he would pepper in a few insults he‚Äòd call ‚Äújokes‚Äù after seeing how they offended me.

He would make fun of me for having an unathletic, underweight body, how I had a weird laugh, how I showed signs of autism, how I‚Äôd make mistakes at work, etc.

Although he picked on me, he‚Äôd insist on skipping his lunch breaks because he liked spending time with me at work.

I thought ‚Äúhe‚Äôs so much nicer than my ex‚Äù.

When he stood me up for a date to see Midsommar, he texted me days later that he wanted to just be friends, that he was dealing with a lot, and that he was in the process of being diagnosed with bipolar.

He told me that he knew I had a crush on him. That was true. I did.

Despite my crush, I agreed with staying platonic friends, and tried to avoid flirtation as best as I could, though I did send him the occasional picture or talk about sex if he mentioned it.

He would still shower me in a delicate blend of compliments and thinly veiled insults disguised as ‚Äújokes‚Äù. I knew if I wanted everything to stay normal at my job, I‚Äôd have to play along.

A few months later, Stuart admitted to me that he was going to rehab for an addiction to painkillers. The night before he was scheduled to be admitted, he asked if we could be ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù.

I said ‚ÄúI thought you just wanted to be friends‚Äù

‚ÄúFriends can have sex‚Äù, he replied

I told him no, with my body image issues and struggles with past assault, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable.

He attempted to convince me he could make me feel comfortable with men and sex again. He mentioned that we both found each other attractive.

I was confused, as friends with benefits implied no feelings. He knew I had feelings for him. Why would he initiate this type of relationship with me?

I felt so pressured, the way he‚Äôd been asking me for such a long time. I was scared of what would happen if I kept saying no. I was never able to tell my ex no.

A few days later, he was out of rehab, and we made plans to go to the movies after our shift together. I wanted to cheer him up and support him because of his substance abuse problems. 

We didn‚Äôt go to the movies. We went to his house.

Fooling around on his air mattress, I asked ‚ÄúDo you have a condom?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, no‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have sex without a condom‚Äù I repeated every time he got a little bit too close for comfort.

Eventually, he ignored me and stuck it in. It hurt.

Stuart didn‚Äôt pull out until a few seconds after I started hitting him. I was so shocked, I acted like it didn‚Äôt just happen. 

Driving me home, he asked ‚ÄúRemember when you said you‚Äôd only let a boyfriend fuck you?‚Äù

My mind was racing. My self worth was so tied up in my ‚Äúnumber‚Äù, my self esteem was in the gutter, he technically already had sex with me, I still had a crush on him, and - we still worked together; he was still my manager.

So - I continued to have sex with him. I hate myself for doing so.

He complained that his Zoloft prescription made it impossible to get hard while wearing a condom, and bitched and moaned that I was the only girl to make him wear one. I felt pressured.

I thought ‚ÄúWell, if I were to catch something, I‚Äôd have already caught it‚Äù.

I quit making him wear condoms.

When I had a flashback from a past assault and cried during sex, he complained that I made him feel bad.

He kept trying to stick his finger in my ass when I told him not to until finally, I let him, to make him happy.

He spat on my face and, when I was visibility upset, said ‚ÄúYou told me you were into that‚Äù. I never told him that.

Sex was excruciating for me, so he‚Äôd force me to be quiet when it hurt, because he still lived at home and didn‚Äôt want his mom to hear.

When I jokingly mentioned the time he fucked me without a condom when I told him not to, he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making me sound like a predator‚Äù

I let him film me occasionally with the promise of not recording my face. He recorded my face in the videos. I overlooked this at the time.

He wrote a song for me called ‚Äú(my name) is a whore/When she comes over/I know I‚Äôll score‚Äù

Pathetically and regrettably, I thanked him for being ‚Äúmore respectful than my ex‚Äù.

Looking back, that‚Äôs like thanking your cat for shitting on your tile floor instead of your white polyester sofa, when your cat should be shitting in their litter box. (a classy simile)

Despite all this, he‚Äôd tell me how beautiful I was and how he adored me and how he quit talking to other girls because he was obsessed with me.  He‚Äôd ask me for more racy material as he said I ‚Äúruined porn‚Äù for him. Even though our relationship was sexual, he told me he could play Monopoly with me fully clothed and not have sex and he‚Äôd still be perfectly happy, because he loved me as a person. 

I thought ‚ÄúWhatever happened to no feelings? He‚Äôs being more affectionate than my ex‚Äù

Eventually, I left my job because, as it was a failing business, they couldn‚Äôt afford to give me more than fifteen hours a week.

Yet, I continued to have sex with him. I was so desperate to prove to myself that he was the good guy that he said he was. I wanted to believe that he really did care - that I wasn‚Äôt cursed romantically and sexually.

I‚Äôd praise him for being such a wonderful guy in an attempt to convince myself that he really was.

I thought I was empowered and having sex on my own terms, because when I told him to stop, he‚Äôd stop most of the time, unless he said that my ‚Äústop‚Äù confused him, because he didn‚Äôt know if I was being serious or not. 

When I tried to break things off with him because I equated sex with love and our ‚Äúno feelings‚Äù situation was confusing me, he said he was obsessed with me, but couldn‚Äôt commit because I planned on moving away for my career, and he didn‚Äôt want to set himself up for heartbreak. 

Towards the end of our relationship, he mentioned several times that his ex was trying to contact him, but he assured me that he was done with her and was ignoring her.

Then he stopped texting me, when we used to text each other daily. Weeks went by.

I asked him if he could return the DVD‚Äôs I left at his house (Several rare, expensive copies that were valuable to me), and he blew me off and ignored me.

I saw a photo of him with his ex on social media. I was enraged. He didn‚Äôt even have the guts to tell me directly that he wanted to end things.

I angrily texted him to give me back my DVD‚Äôs, to delete the photos/videos he had of me, and to never talk to me again. I told him that I couldn‚Äôt believe that I thought he respected me.

Sure, I overreacted, but I felt so hurt.

I should mention I was very upset during this time because my grandmother had died after a long illness where I was her part time carer, and I had lost two close friends of mine recently.

‚ÄúI hope we can be mature enough about this to stay friends‚Äù, he responded, after emphasizing that he was ‚Äúalways respectful‚Äù towards me.

When I told him I thought it best if we didn‚Äôt speak to each other anymore, he replied ‚ÄúJust trying to be nice‚Äù

He added that I was too emotional and that‚Äôs why he got back with his ex without telling me, that I ‚Äúwas always upset about something‚Äù so he didn‚Äôt want to tell me, reminding me that it was nothing but casual sex with no feelings, that he never really liked me, and I was delusional for thinking that he did. Every nice thing he said to me, he remarked, he only said because he was high.  

He complained that I never shut the fuck up, despite having ‚Äúsuch an easy life‚Äù. I know my life is easy, it just stung. I felt invalid.

He argued ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an adult, you wanted to fuck, so we did. You‚Äôre emotionally immature.‚Äù

The whole time, I believed he liked me, because that‚Äôs what he told me. That‚Äôs how I justified what I did with him, despite him not being my boyfriend. I felt deceived. Lied to. Even though it seems like everyone who has casual sex doesn‚Äôt feel the way that I do.

He refused to give me back my films, telling me to come get them myself. Note: I don‚Äôt drive after a traumatic incident with my ex, and it would‚Äôve been humiliating to ask my mom to drive me to his house.

After back and forth arguing and insulting each other, (I brought up how he cheated on his ex and abused drugs - which was so mean of me to say, and he brought up how I was a slut for sending him him racy material) he gave up and agreed to return them.

I texted him ‚ÄúThe first night we were at your house, I told you I didn‚Äôt want to have sex without a condom, yet you fucked me anyway. Why would you do that?‚Äù

Stuart became defensive, arguing that I only brought that up because I was upset at him, that he didn‚Äôt remember that night, that I told him myself that he was respectful towards me, that I was ‚Äúalways down‚Äú to have sex without a condom.

To be fair, I did only bring it up because we were arguing. Besides, what kind of girl has feelings for a guy who assaulted her?

Answer: Me, twice.

After my accusation, he blocked me. I felt terrible for what I said during our argument. 

Not to mention - he possibly lied about deleting the pictures/videos he had of me on his phone (he kept his former ex‚Äôs photos over a year after the broke up). Those would ruin my career plans. He could get in contact with my ex who might try to hurt me. He could shit talk me to our friends/old coworkers. I couldn‚Äôt have him angry with me.

He also was charming, popular, everyone liked him. I was introverted and awkward. I rationalized that I had to be in the wrong, because he was so perfect and put together on the outside.

To add to this, during our argument, he said he pitied me for painting myself as a victim all the time. I did not want to be a victim anymore. I didn‚Äôt want the only men I was sexually involved with to have both assaulted me. I didn‚Äôt want a complete stranger to have assaulted me. I wanted to believe that he was a good guy who wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. After all, I had thought that I really liked him.

Since he blocked me, I used a fake number to apologize to him (my ex used fake numbers to harass me after our breakup, that‚Äôs how I got the idea. Crazy, I know). It was a lengthy apology about how I overreacted and that I was the one in the wrong. 

In further attempts to mend the situation, I sent him a gift card and apologized again for my behavior. His girlfriend found out and asked me why I did that. I don‚Äôt know why I did. I was just desperate. I lied and told her I was a platonic friend sending him a small gift. I‚Äôm sure she assumed I was a girl Stuart was cheating on her with.

Stuart probably thinks he‚Äôs some hero who cured my trauma with his dick. He probably thinks I‚Äôm a crazy bitch who only pointed out what happened the first night I was over because I was bitter. He doesn‚Äôt know that what he did is eating me alive.

I‚Äôve given up on romance. All I‚Äôve gotten from it is pain and self-disgust. I took a chance, and I want to die because of it. I never want to have sex again.

I quit therapy because he was the one who recommended that I try it again in the first place. My therapist told me that I likely had depression and PTSD, but I feel like I‚Äôm just immature and too emotional, like Stuart said I was.

There‚Äôs nothing I can even do about what he did now. No one would believe me. As far as anyone‚Äôs concerned, it was just a relationship gone sour.

I‚Äôm worried he already talked shit about me to our old coworkers and friends, because none of them really talk to me anymore. 

I hate the fact that every man I‚Äôve ever been close to has assaulted me or at least attempted to. I feel like a piece of meat. I feel like I deserved it. All of it. I‚Äôm so disgusted with myself.

I wish I could call him and scream at him for what he did to me. Then again, I feel like he didn‚Äôt really do anything to me, as it was just ‚Äúcasual sex‚Äù, and I apologized for accusing him of rape. I can‚Äôt take it back.

He got what he wanted, and I‚Äôm left to suffer with the questions I ask myself every day, questions I don‚Äôt think I will ever have a definite answer for:

After all this, do I even have a right to call it assault? Rape? Abuse? Or, did I deserve it?

It was so easy to recognize that my ex boyfriend was abusive. I was able to talk about what he did to me days after our breakup. With Stuart, even months after our friendship ended, I have doubts on what really happened between us.

depression,"Part I

First of all, I would like to apologize as this is going to be quite lengthy. Buckle up, because what I'm about to say is some pretty wild stuff.

I guess I will start at the beginning of this long and sordid tale. Like so many others, I found myself at the hands and mercy of a family member who decided to teach me the finer points on how to pleasure men when I was 8 years old, and yes I am a male. This abuse happened on a regular basis for quite some time, though this many years later I am kind of fuzzy on the exact length of time, but it wasn't short by any stretch. 

The very first fucked-up thing about this is after a time, I began to like it and look forward to it. I should also mention that during this time my seven-year-old sister was also the focus of some of his attention. Sometimes he even made us play so he could watch, though I only remember this happening a few times. After a while it mainly seemed he was interested in me maybe because after a time I was more receptive than she was.

This went on for a time, and then I remember one day me and my sister were outside playing with these dangerous metal battery powered helicopter toys. Some of you may remember these, it had a red cylinder that you held onto and you put the batteries in with a silver button. This was attached to the little helicopter by steel wire which was very thin, and when you pressed the button the blades would turn quite fast if it had fresh batteries. I learned that you could really tear some shit up with those things... üòÅ

Anyways, we were just sitting there playing and she all of a sudden just said I think we should go tell Mom about what is going on. For some reason it struck me as being a good idea so after sitting there for some time we went in and we told our mom.

She literally laughed at us.

It took some doing, a bit of screaming and crying on her part, to get my mom to actually start to quote-unquote take this shit seriously. Well, little did I know that she was already cooking up some bullshit. She decided the first thing to do was to take us to the doctor. She did this by lying to my dad and telling him that she thought we may be coming down with the measles. Did he question her? No he did not. Did he go into the examination room with us? No he did not. Did he bother following up with my mom about this? Not to my knowledge. What I do remember, is having a strange doctor shove his fingers up my ass, and then give me a balloon and a piece of candy for my trouble. 

I changed.

I remember the time before all of that happened, and I was a sharp bright brave little boy. I never had trouble talking to the girls, and was well-liked by the other children. And then, through no fault of my own I was scarred, grievously injured in such a way that my young mind could not understand it. I became withdrawn, scared to engage people, lashing out with horrible bouts of rage and anger.  I immediately went to the status of ""that kid."" Did anybody at the private school I went to stop and ask themselves how such a rapid change in a person could occur? No they did not. I began to almost immediately fall victim to bullies, and I became the staffs favorite whipping boy when anything happened even if I had nothing to do with it. I was an outcast, and this had a huge effect on my social skills and development. 

By the time I reached my teenage years, things were very very bad. My social skills were stunted, and had the vitality of a fallout ghoul with a severe case of alopecia. Of course, this shit followed me into adulthood, and wreaked severe havoc and caused even more damage to my already damaged soul. And as logic would dictate, this shit haunts my soul to this very moment, which is also why I'm here. I am genuinely hoping that there is one soul out there, somebody who can help me, because I am very tired now. Do I want to harm myself or others, hell no, I might have my problems but I don't roll like that. Now in the past in earlier years did I consider suicide? Oh yes I did, got close a couple of times too. 

Now we come to the present.

I'm just going to spill it as I see it, because I have no other way to organize it, so I apologize for the monolith of text, but it is necessary because I have to get everything out. And I will also say that I am most certainly willing to answer any questions anyone may have, who knows, it may be helpful.

I'm going to stop part one right here, I think I may be getting close to the post limit, so I will immediately begin part 2 as a reply to this one.","I need help, bad.",UnluckyEditor,2020-06-20 04:20:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcfm92/i_need_help_bad/,10,1.0,8,4,885

depression,"I‚Äôm sorry that this is going to be a long and messy post . It‚Äôs my first time posting. I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Also, I‚Äôm not actually clinically diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness because I haven‚Äôt went to seek help and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm feeling and experiencing. 

I come from a society which places a huge importance on education and where there is a huge stigma on mental health issues. I‚Äôm 18 and all my life I‚Äôve done extremely well in my academics and people have high expectations of me. Not that anyone forces their expectations on me and makes me stress or anything but I just know they all expect me to do well because I‚Äôve been getting good grades all along. I also have a huge and rather loving family. Amongst my friends, I would say that my life is sort of more ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù in a sense because I don‚Äôt lack anything. I‚Äôm not exceptionally close to my family though. To add on, I have few friends in my life and I feel that I can‚Äôt actually keep friends. We all seem to just drift apart after some time, especially when we move on to different paths in our lives.

There is absolutely no reason for me to be depressed and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually depressed. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling and I‚Äôm just really confused and helpless. I don‚Äôt know how long it has been, maybe 4 or 5 years, but I‚Äôve been feeling super unmotivated to do anything and I‚Äôve always blamed it on me being lazy.  I procrastinate a lot and always find it hard to complete tasks even though I so desperately want to. I find myself to be an extremely sensitive person and I‚Äôve actually been really shy most of my life until these recent few years. 

I‚Äôve always just brushed it off but recently I‚Äôm just super lost. I find no purpose in living. I have no goals in life and I have nothing to look forward to. However, i don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm suicidal and I would never consider taking my own life but every single day, I just wish to no longer exist. I wish for my life to be taken away and I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. Living just seems so boring and so tiring. I‚Äôm tired of repeating the same cycle everyday and I just wish to never wake up. I‚Äôm not afraid of death but I‚Äôm afraid of feeling pain. That‚Äôs why I have never considered taking my own life.  

These past month was super mentally draining to me especially since school started again. Every single day, I dread going to school. I just breakdown every night and cry for hours for absolutely no reason. During my breakdowns, I feel absolutely helpless and trapped. I feel so suffocated and my mind is just filled with so many things. School drains me more than anything and I find it absolutely tiring. I just don‚Äôt want to deal with anything. To add on, I don‚Äôt understand why but I‚Äôve been feeling anxious and uneasy every single day for the past few weeks. Maybe it‚Äôs because exams are nearing but I‚Äôve never felt this way my whole life. I just feel on the edge all the time. 

I hate that I breakdown and cry every night and I hate feeling anxious all the time. I hate being so unmotivated and I hate that I don‚Äôt have a purpose in life. I hate that everyone seems to think I‚Äôm okay but I‚Äôm actually not. I hate myself because even I don‚Äôt understand myself and why I‚Äôm feeling like this. I hate that I can‚Äôt tell anyone about this because I‚Äôm afraid of being an emotional burden. I hate that I‚Äôm slowly destroying my life because of my lack of motivation. I hate that I was born into this world. I hate myself for being so ungrateful for all that I have. I just hate the way I feel and I just hate myself so much.

I often wonder what would happen if i was out of the picture, maybe they would be content at the least and still married. Ive been debating running away and killing myself so that they would never have to worry about me again, but then i remembered suicide hurts, and i dont want to hurt anymore. Ive gotten good at hiding my emotions, the most i show is sarcasm and i try to not involve other people in my problems because i dont want them to be sad or cry, i never want anyone to feel how I feel, but i guess now im not too good at that either.. Im writing this because i want to show the, well presumably small amount of people reading this how bad it feels to hurt others, even if its in ways you dont know, Be kind and appreciate all your friends and the people that trust or look up to you.",I dont know what to do anymore,Slavic_Wizard,2020-06-20 08:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hciqlh/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,3,1.0,3,7,243

depression,"Hello folks, I've posted here before a few times if I remember correctly, but wanted to share some more recent ongoing concerns. Often when I post here, I like to preface the main content of it with a bit about myself and how this is relevant to the current situation. I graduated university with my bachelor's degree in psychology back in 2014, excelling academically, making Dean's list consistently and earning 'magna cum laude' distinction along with my degree. Up until the end of my time in university, I struggled with a number of mental health issues, including severe social anxiety (to the point where I had to commute instead of staying on campus in student dorms) and depression. Despite all of this, I was always motivated and perhaps a bit too idealistic that all of the hard work I put into my studies would pay off. Needless to say, I was taken aback by how challenging it was to find and secure work in my field after graduation. I had applied for a number of clinical research positions to no avail, as they were seeking someone with prior clinical experience. I had to settle for retail work for some time to make ends meet   before finding a position as a ""counselor"" at a major psychiatric hospital in my area. I use the term loosely, as my position didn't require any formal training (master's degree, etc.) to obtain. In fact, you needed nothing more than a high school diploma to have a fighting chance at this job. With that said, it was a position relevant to my interests so I figured it would serve me well. Unfortunately, I let my anxiety get the best of me here again, as I opted to work overnight shifts, with minimal exposure to patients and aspects of their treatment (exposure-response prevention therapy, de-escalation, check ins about individual well being and so in). And when tasked to assist with helping patients, I would often allow my coworker to handle the task while I completed paperwork at my desk. There have been times I pushed myself outside my comfort zone to connect and offer support with patients, but I found it emotionally draining and overwhelming almost every time. I began to second guess the career path I had chosen, but have great insurance and benefits associated with this job that I just couldn't give up. I've been in this position for just about 5 years now and I think it would be best to move on now, but I simply don't have the motivation or inclination to put forth any more effort. I've resigned myself to the idea that this likely will be my reality for some time to come. I spend my days off sleeping all day as I don't have the energy to confront my situation. I don't even know where to go from here. I was accepted to a master's of counseling program at NYU two years ago, but these plans ultimately fell through as I felt I just wasn't ready. I'm 28 years old, turning 29 next month (in July) and I don't know when or if I'll ever feel ready. Looking back on all of this, part of me questions whether I really put in all this work to get here just to feel validated and accepted or if this was what I truly wanted the whole time. I think my time for introspection is running out and I may be screwed, for lack of a better word. If you folks could provide any feedback or suggestions on how I might move forward from here, it would be very appreciated.",Unsure What Steps to Take Moving Forward in Life,SirBeardsAlot91,2020-06-20 04:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcftif/unsure_what_steps_to_take_moving_forward_in_life/,5,1.0,6,9,610

So now my friend act like a little off, he would smile to anyone who visit him and ask if they are ok. And in one occasion, someone spotted him calling his wife using his hand as if it were a phone.

I read online that this condition is normal for people who had traumatic event. Do you have your friends or family who had this? how are they now? are they ok?

depression,"She was EVERYTHING to me and I really only developed a spark of interest ( love ) for her on our 2nd month of friendship. She always helped me through my rough times and chases away the people who've hurt me, me and her made a promise almost 7 years ago that we'd never fight or hurt eachother. 
So recently I've noticed something odd about her since she doesnt really respind to my texts anymore.
One day I asked her ""why weren't you active yesterday? Its not only yesterday, you've been like this for 3 weeks now."" She then told me and explained that she already started dating someone else for 3 weeks now so she couldn't really spend time with me on texting and talking to eachother.
I then pretended that I'm supporting her on her first relationship, I replied with ""Im so proud of you!"" Next to a red heart and she responded with a blue heart saying ""Thank you Yuri"" I then understood the situation more clearly back then. I really miss her
Its been 3 weeks since we last talked and I dont want her to hate me, I'd rather not be involved in her relationship than for her to really stop talking to me and leave me.

depression," I feel pathetic. Everyday. Every damn day. I can‚Äôt help it. Most of the times I don‚Äôt have a reason as to why I feel disgusting and pathetic and I feel even more sick if I don‚Äôt have a reason. I‚Äôm tired. So so so so so tired of life. Im tired of living through each day, looking at the same things, sometimes new things but they don‚Äôt bother me ‚Äî all I get is an empty/blank mind. I‚Äôm tired of things and people around me as well as myself. I hate the body I was born in. I look disgusting. My skin looks disgusting. My eyes, my hands, my stomach, everything.
Why was I even born? My parents could have had better lives without me: no financial, physical and mental burdens. I feel sorry for them. They fight pretty often. But on the other hand I do sometimes feel annoyed. My father always is shoddy. He is great in terms of work but with family stuff? No. He always uses the excuse: ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get rid of me soon, since I‚Äôm already old.‚Äù Or ‚Äúif you dont like me i‚Äôll go away.‚Äù Whenever he starts treating me like a straight up baby which doesnt even know the basics of common knowledge. Thats NOT THE DAMN POINT- why can‚Äôt he improve to be a proper father? I tell him stuff of the fathers of my classmates who are always volunteering with chores and actively supporting their child. My dad doesn‚Äôt  even know what grade I am in with this stupid piano exam. And I have been doing it for years now. Speaking of piano, as much as I love it, I hate it now. I hate everything about it. I hate how I suck at it even after 10 years of practice, i hate how i have to do these STUPID piano exams when I don‚Äôt even want to study music, i hate how im always being compared to with other people, etc. I despise it. So, so, so SO MUCH. Apropos my mother, I can never... NEVER cry in front of her. She scoffs and treats me like a delusional, weak person. I had a breakdown with my graduation exams and she looked down at me. Laughed at me and turned her back. ‚ÄúGet yourself together. Stop crying, you‚Äôre so weak‚Äù is what I was told. Now I subconsciously tell myself the same thing. I can never open up my true feelings. They won‚Äôt understand. And trust me I have told them‚Äî nothing changed.
I‚Äôm sick and tired and pathetic. I‚Äôm scared too. I‚Äôm scared of dying. I always think: ‚Äúif i just die... i won‚Äôt have to go through this embarrassing life of mines.‚Äù 
I work so hard to be good academically but in the end, its all worth nothing. Im not capable of doing anything. Im just a frail, weak child who cried at everything in secret. I‚Äôm always comparing myself and being compared to other smart and younger people. I wish I was good at something. But no, I‚Äôm not. Im just horrible at everything. I thought that after graduation life will get better but its getting worse. I used to cut and I gave up due to fear of death but now I started again. Im scared. But when I grab the cutter I start crying again and I can‚Äôt let go of it. I feel like I deserve it. I deserve all bad things. Nothing good will come out of anything anymore. Its just no use. Nothing helps. When I do cut I feel even more pathetic, like I didn‚Äôt cut deep enough.
 ‚ÄúI should cut deeper, this isn‚Äôt enough pain. I deserve more pain, I‚Äôm a pathetic thing.‚Äù 
I try so hard to not talk about it because no one understands.  Sometimes I am happy but it just keeps crawling back to me and reminding me that I‚Äôm pathetic and stupid. I don‚Äôt want to die yet I still want to kill myself. The main reason I don‚Äôt want to leave is that in my next life I will have to go through the same thing again and I don‚Äôt want that- I hate this. My mother told me a story that people who commit suicide will be bound to do it again in their next lives. I don‚Äôt want that. I want my next life to be happier so I try so hard to be a good person even though I know I‚Äôm not a good person. I go out of my way to help people but in the end I still feel disgusting.
I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry for not having a real reason to be like this. I just can‚Äôt help it. Living is just a pain nowadays and being seen as a happy go lucky person makes it harder to keep up the role, especially if your parents think you have already healed after a childhood where you were bullied.",Im an idiot for being like this,kurekkun,2020-06-20 06:21:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hch2v7/im_an_idiot_for_being_like_this/,3,0.84,4,7,829
depression,"For years I've dealt with suicidal thoughts. They haunt me when I'm in my good days and are scarily comforting when I'm depressed and thinking I'm worthless. From checking other people's posts I now think is a ""common"" thing, but it doesn't make it any less disturbing.

I'm a suicide survivor and I think I deal with depression in a somewhat healthy way now, but still haven't been able to keep the good days rolling for more than a couple weeks without thinking of ending it all for good. Can't lie, freeing myself from the mood swings, hurting the few people that are still around me and the thoughts of a better life that I will never have are things that drive me towards suicidal thoughts again. 

With time most the friends I used to relay upon when I needed it simply stopped being there for me, and the few that remain just don't understand it. I think that having to deal with things by myself taught me that no one will understand your problems better that you, and advice may be comforting at times but in the end it's just you.

I'm 24, am not very social, have only had a couple of jobs, and have lost all sense of enjoyment that used to be in my life. I've lived to see the world only get worse, to see my peers somehow handle this better than me, and to feel like a total failure over that as well.

Nothing I have tried in order to turn myself around works. Exercising makes me feel a little better, but it doesn't solve the fucking problem.

depression,"Hello, i am 16 years old from Charleston West Virginia and i think i am struggling with depression. I have tried to think of happy things when i get depressed but nothing seems to work. I was hesitant about coming to reddit with this because trolls and stuff but i honestly don't care anymore, my life honestly couldn't get any worse. When i was about 9 years old i was taken from my parents because they were using meth,heroin and Xanax but life seemed pretty good to me because i was only a child. My brother, sister and i were taken to my grandmother house to stay for a while and we were having visits with our parents but then a couple of months after we were living with my grandmother my sister and her got in a argument ending in my grandma slapping my sister down on the floor, so we went on another visit with my parents and told them and our ""visit guide"" Laura who was a total babe and just a cool person to be around lol all about it and we were then moved to my step grandmothers house. She wasn't the best person but she sure as hell didn't slap us. Life was alright living with her and eventually my parents got off the drugs and soon enough we moved back in with them. But to this day they still do Xanax sometimes which tears me the fuck up and i kinda want to fight my dad sometimes but anyway now im in high school and the depression has hit me harder than ever. The only thing that seems to make me happy anymore is my niece who is about 5 months old now and i love her to death and back. I would do anything for this little girl. Before she came along i had thought about suicide every day of my life. I still think about it sometimes but then i see that baby and think how it would make her life in the future, i would never do anything to hurt her but i hurt all the time, i think im slowly losing my mind. My uncle killed himself and i still think about that all the time. I also can't get this girl out of my head, i won't say her name because i don't think i am aloud to, to be honest. But she is perfect in every way, her skin is light brown and as soft as a feather, her hair is puffy like cotton candy and her smile is as beautiful as the sky is blue. I am head over heals for this girl lol. I have been thinking of telling her but i am not sure if she has a boyfriend at the moment. We have flirted back and forth in guitar class a lot. But I'm not sure if she was being serious or not, It wouldn't matter if she really has a boyfriend because im not like that, cuz i know if i had a girlfriend and she cheated on me i would almost certainly commit suicide but that is beside the point. I also hate entitled assholes who have muscle and get nudes by the daily and then go on snapchat and bitch about how they don't get girls, its like no bro that isn't your role. They don't know the struggle, i haven't had a girlfriend since sixth grade and you haven't had a gf for a week and then you come and cry on the internet like honestly stfu. I once posted on snapchat how badly i wanted to die and somehow my school found out, they told me to go to a doctor or something. Im not gonna pay someone to sit in a chair for a half hour and not do anything about my fucking crazy head. I really do think im a psycho sometimes. I have fantasized about taking a gut to my school during a pep rally and making everyone sit down and listen to my problems then i would tell them all to leave and as they were doing that i would shoot myself in the head. I have no intentions on killing anyone for the record, it just doesn't seem interesting to me and it honestly makes me sick, i would never take another life unless they did something unspeakable to my family or my friends.

So since I was a 4 I‚Äôve never been allowed to act like a kid or a be myself I‚Äôve been ignored or had to act like a fucking parent in some regards. Dealing with this with someone who destroys your house, smears shit everywhere, constantly needs to be the centre of attention, and has absolutely no empathy for anyone weres you thin mentally and physically. This being exasperated by a mum who‚Äôs constantly getting involved with drunks who beat you mentally and your brothers and sister physically, emotional manipulators, and just general fucking scam artists doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve never had friends I‚Äôve always been the outcast, bullied in school, ostracised by every one be them adult or child. My whole childhood was just an exercise in not killing my self I spent from 12 until 17 either locked in my room with basically doing nothing or looking after my brother. I‚Äôm just invisible and no one ever cared. I never achieved anything at school and as a result I work at amazon, the worst company in the world probably. I‚Äôm basically a machine that stands for 10 to twelve hours a day with my legs being crushed by my 27 stone body with basically no break to speak of. I wake up work and sleep cause if I move my body hurts cause it can‚Äôt take it I literally have no free time. On top of that I have heart and back problems which prevent me from even trying to lose my weight which is just getting worse everyday cause food is my only comfort. I‚Äôm close to a mental breakdown honestly. I‚Äôve tried therapy so many times I‚Äôve lost count it‚Äôs definitely but nothing ever helps. Even now at 21 I‚Äôm living with my mum dealing with my brother still, with the additional responsibility of looking after my crippled mum who can hardly move. On top of this I‚Äôve got neighbors and such threatening me weekly cause of how my brother acts. At this point I‚Äôm just to far down the rabbit hole I don‚Äôt know how to sort anything I‚Äôm in debt I barely make enough to survive, I‚Äôve got my employer breathing down my neck with the threat of getting laid off. I‚Äôve got physical threats against me cause of my brother, and I have no life at all or any relation to anyone who isn‚Äôt family.

depression,"Well my life isn't a downward spiral. I am not alone. I have a girlfriend a good job, an apartment and friends and family.

I still feel sad and overwhelmed all the time. I feel like I see all that free space in my schedule for becoming better doing something. I can't even tell you what.

It is like I feel meant for something but I don't know what it is. Everything else just doesn't really feel like anything honestly. I just see my goals and then feel and think through every grueling minute it takes to get there.

I want to lose weight and do sports and learn more shit and develop and socialize. I even know how to get there. But the actual getting there the ""hustle"" isn't at all fun to me.

I have friends and they enjoy doing things. Not just products and outcomes. They like the process. And most things in life just kind of happened to me to lead me where I am now. But I feel like to get further from here I'd need drive and follow through and I don't even know where to conjure that.

I am bored out of my mind. I feel lost and confused and I want a million things but I am paralyzed to start actually achieving anything.

I feel empty and purposeless... Pointless.

I am 30 now and I feel like a failure by my own standards. My standards that measure myself against knowing what I could have achieved if I where capable of putting the work in.

Now the truly horrible thing is that I don't know how to get myself out of it if I am unable to follow through on these promises I make to myself.

How am I supposed to get better when Will itself escapes me?

I am looking for therapy but it's not easy. I have a supportive girlfriend who is good and kind and patient with me.

I have family and friendsi could count on, yet I feel I cant talk to or them bother with how I am feeling. I have a job but it feels horrible because I am deathly afraid of not outgrowing this job quick enough by my own standards or just that I am beneath my own potential. II am afraid that potential is a lie. That I am just not smart or strong enough.

I feel overwhelm with the life I've ""built"" so far and am so afraid of going forward like this.

I feel trapped and hollow and ashamed. And most of all I feel guilty for being so fucking useless while I have some many good things and foundations I could use to better myself.

I hate myself for having so much and not being able to enjoy any of it and seeing no way to feel better.

Now I guess  Ill keep on trying in hopes I start to feel something.

depression,"Hi there, thanks in advance for reading :)

My husband is a highly educated professional in a demanding field he has always excelled in. The job has high expectations and long hours but he has always liked his work. He has worked so hard and because of this he was offered an exciting new job a few months at one of the big companies in his industry using some connections and we were really excited about what the future held. 

That being said, my husband has been suffering from mental illness since he was a teen and it has always been something he was in denial about, but for some reason these issues hit him especially hard since beginning this new job.  This has had a major impact on his performance and turned him from the driven, dependable all-star he has always been to a shell of his former self. He misses important meetings, is chronically late due to oversleeping and takes an unreasonable about of time to complete tasks, often missing deadlines altogether. He also has a very negative mindset and sees every day as being terrible. Every single day I say ‚Äúhow was work, what did you work on today?‚Äù And every day the answer is something along the lines of ‚Äúit was shit, I got nothing done‚Äù or ‚Äúit was shit, I made a bunch of mistakes‚Äù. If I am anything other than boundlessly positive and optimistic about these comments he becomes angry and cold.  If I voice my concerns he gets more and more upset too which is understandable. 

This has been heartbreaking to see, but after years of encouragement from me he finally agreed to start seeing a therapist. I set up the appointments, paid for them, reminded him of them, etc. All he had to do was show up, which I know is a BIG DEAL, and he did (I am so proud!). There have been 3 sessions in total now and I am so proud of him for taking this step, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be making a whole lot of difference and I am starting to get really worried. He says he doesn‚Äôt find it overly helpful?? 

Anyways, he told me he had a meeting with his boss today about some recent deadlines he missed and basically the theme of the meeting was that it can‚Äôt keep happening. They are aware of his mental health issues and are willing to accommodate him but he doesn‚Äôt know what help to ask for and I think their patience is running out. 

I am terrified he will be fired due to this poor performance. Mostly I am extremely afraid his self esteem will never be able to recover and he won‚Äôt get another job and be even more miserable, and we truly cannot afford to lose his income either. And if he is fired for poor performance he will not be eligible for benefits where we live. This puts our financial security at risk (we live somewhat modestly but do have a mortgage etc). 

I want my husband back. I want him to feel fulfilled, confident, satisfied, and proud of himself. I would love for him to be happy. He is an amazing person who deserves this so much. 

A relevant fact here is that he is pretty much estranged from his mother but she is extremely mentally unwell and has had several suicide attempts in recent years, including this year. His best friend is also depressed and has had countless suicide attempts, also in this current year. I live in fear of my husband trying to hurt himself. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation and could offer some tips from the other side? Should I try and convince him to try a new therapist or make more sessions with the current one? Is there anything in particular I can do to be more supportive?

I can‚Äôt sleep at night because I am so worried about his health, wellbeing, safety, happiness, and our financial future. He is such a good man and deserves all the happiness in the world. We also want a family but obviously we need to be in good health first, but I am afraid that will never happen. 

Truly any tips or guidance would be endlessly appreciated, thank you!!!

depression,"My issues are all about abandonment, and feeling worthless blah blah, so this one was rough. 


Back when we all went into quarantine, my therapist and I emailed a few times back and forth, to see about setting up sessions online. Things were nuts with work, and with getting my kids set up with school at home. I didnt see how, for that week, I could have an online session with any privacy with my whole family running around. So I said, let's get settled and try for next week. 


A few days later, I was sick in bed with coronavirus. The next 6 weeks were gross. I dont recommend it. When I was okay again, I went to email my therapist and realized he hadn't checked in, at all. I was a little mad, but mostly sad and also exhausted and also going into a major depression episode. Now its been 3 months, and I never heard anything from him.


I emailed him earlier this week, and kind of said, what the fuck, except a little nicer. His reply was, thank you for telling me how this made you feel. We spoke on the phone and he gave some super lame excuse like, I sensed I needed to be careful with you. WHAT. what does that even mean? 


Therapists, don't be like this therapist. At least send a one-line email, like, hey, are you alive?  A patient who is in communication regularly and then abruptly stops communication? Check on them. I didnt ditch this dude. I just wasn't capable of getting out of my bed for almost a month, and then for 2 weeks after that could barely walk down the block. I didnt know what day it was half the time.

depression,"I am sort of at a loss.  I have dealt with depression for most of my life.  I am 46 now.  I see a counselor, but the one thing I cannot seem to get past is my regret of my decisions... all I want is a time machine to go back and do it differently.  To the point I get so depressed I don't want to do anything ever again. 

So right now I am struggling with two points.  I changed jobs and I regret changing jobs.  This one is more secure, but I like the people and work of my other one more.  My wife says if I didn't change jobs I would simply be regretting staying and wishing I would have taken the job.  So.. no matter what I would be depressed and sorry.   I really don't like the work I do... but wonder if I will ever like any work I do.  Then I just don't want to do anything, but I have four kids to take care of.  So I keep moving, but only for them and because I feel I have to. 

The second thing is stupid, but it underscores how bad things are.  I was trying to make some bushes that hedge my front yard to the street and are 30 years old look nice.  Instead it didn't go well and now I have to take them all out.  They are junipers that were big, apparently if you cut them too much they don't fill in.  So I thought I would make them look like nice little trees and failed miserably and now they have to be removed.  I lost my hedge and the old bushes.  So by the time I came in last night all I could think about was how bad I messed up yet again.  Then all night all I could think about is how I wish I could go back in time.. do something different with my life so I didn't mess this stuff up all the time. 

I feel like I always make the wrong decision and do the wrong thing.   I am blessed and yet feel so unhappy about my life.

Tonight, out of no where while laying in bed with my husband and admitting that I havent felt connected to anyone or anything in so long I started crying. I havent cried like this in years. Like everything was coming out. 

It was one of the single most painful cathartic moments in my life. I switched between feeling happy about having feelings, to feeling sad there was so much pain, to being happy I could look at my husband with emotion, to being sad I've been trapped all this time.

I cried for an hour. It felt like it lifted something. But not everything. Like it was a glimpse into how I used to feel.

depression,"I think my ""true self"" is in deep conflict with the person I perceive myself to be, and hence I can never express my true feelings. I am very self conscious, with zero self esteem.
Loneliness caused me to feel sad and crave for attention, and low self esteem has pushed me away from people apart from immediate friends and family.
Im 18 and I waste all my days doing nothing.
This behaviour of mine has made me pity myself, and I dream about situations where I would wish to be all day. Turns out this trait has made my cravings for attention and validation shoot through the roof, and as a result it seems like I want to make my self miserable so that someone notices me and helps.

I have so many things that I have to get done and I haven't really started anything.  I'm afraid that no matter how hard I work or how much effort I put in it won't be nearly enough and I'll end up behind again.

Today the fear of losing the woman I love overcame my fear of not being good enough. I spent the whole day being as productive as I could be. As soon as I got home from work I went to help relatives with things I had been putting off. I did some repairs around the house. I spent almost every available moment trying to get something done. I made progress and I was proud.  I had spent the entire day trying to improve things for the people I live.

When my fiance got home I was excited to show her what I had done.  She was underwhelmed to say the least. She spent the rest of the night pointing out everything else that I need to do. She complained about all the other things I have been putting off. I just wanted acknowledgment of the days accomplishment. I just wanted a job well done. I planned to spend all day tomorrow getting more done, and I still will but my heart just isn't in it.

I told her how I was feeling and she was supportive for a whole half minute. Then it was back to my failures. Why should I try so hard when doing nothing gets the same result?

Now I‚Äôve got my own place so I‚Äôve asked them to come down to visit me and see the place. It‚Äôs been over a month now of them saying they‚Äôd come down but then not doing so.

depression,"Been having sleepless nights for a long time now. Can't seem to sleep, brain feels way to active just thinking..

About how much better everything would be if it wasn't me who was born. What if someone more talented, smarter, more hardworking than me was born instead. Someone who could reach great heights and achieve so much more. My mom would be so much happier.

I want to just disappear, everything feels so stressful, I don't even have a single friend i could chat with, just working so hard to put up a fake and tough front and pretending like I have a few different groups of friends so that ""my friends"" wouldn't look down on me. So that I could even feel a little elevated. But in reality, I'm constantly alone everyday. Everything i do started feeling meaningless, like what's the point when there's no one to show it to or enjoy with.

I want to die but I can't bear the thought of leaving my mom like that, after all her hardwork to raise me. Just feels terrible and wrong to do something so selfish just because I can't handle the stress.

I didn't live an awful life, I'm not particularly poor, I do have quite an asshole of a father but I have an amazing mom who does everything she can to make it better.  

I'd do anything to make it up and give it back to her but I don't see how i could, I'm fucking stupid, doing horribly in school and barely clinging on so that I don't retain a year. I have no talent,  I don't look like some natural supermodel, I'm neither funny nor creative nor charismatic.

depression,"I didn't mean for this to sound funny but I've been trying to find a way to describe how I feel. 

My life feels exactly like I'm a NPC. For those who don't know a NPC is a character from a videogame that is not controlled by a player but has no freedom whatsoever. 

A NPC does the same thing over and over, so much that sometimes doesn't feel like a person but more like a robot. A NPC might be sad or angry but it feels unnatural because he's just following a programming code, he/she is not really sad but just doing what is more acceptable in the specific situation. 

That is my life most of my days I'm not even sad or angry, I'm very neutral to most things. I don't even stress about things because I never leave my routine, I never do other things because I don't think about them. 

I'm breathing, living and that's it. 

I'm not resentful with life or with anyone, and I might even say my life has been good. 

But then it happens something that isn't part of the routine and I just push it down. I haven't cried or been sad enough for the ones who parted before me. 

My promises, my dreams and hopes are nothing but an illusion of something that never existed. 

I'm living day by day but that's it, I have a tunnel vision that doesn't allow me to see the bigger picture. 

I'm not sad or depressed because I haven't allowed myself to even get to that point,

depression,"I'm very tired. And I see no changes on the horizon. I'll be 50 July 1.  I've been back and forth with suicidal ideations and actual plans for suicide, going as far as choosing a date and collecting materials needed. I had hoped that my current relationship with a woman I am completely compatible with would help me. It hasn't. My iron-clad defence against suicide has always been my daughters. I love them so. I would never want to put into their head that my suicide would be their hereditary fate by nature or nurture. But even this is beginning to wane. As I said I'm tired. I've had countless therapists and medication regimens. I'm cure-proof. I'm almost 50. I've had enough. I don't want a birthday. I don't want to celebrate. I just want to blink out of the universe. I want to disappear from the information and causality of reality. I'm done. 

I receive no physical affection. I never have. Even as an infant, through a series of unfortunate events, I think I received very little physical affection. 

This continued through childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood... To this very day. No hugs for me. Even in my current love with Elaine...I have to beg her to pet my face. I just want to be held and loved, for real... Not obligatory, not for pity, not because I'm human... because I'm loved. I don't even really get this from my daughters. I get obligatory pity hugs from them.  

I'm done. I'm tired. I'm not at the stage of setting a date and collecting materials but I'm heading in that direction.

Every 4-5 days a new ""trend"" comes out, that causes the nation to become obsessed with the smallest details.  The media gives you only enough in each paragraph to your demographic that takes you into a forest of predetermined links to give you barely the information to satisfy your knowledge cravings.

Though you're still hungry for more, you take up bouts with peers to either learn more, or fuel that adrenaline from a petty debate of who's article worded it to fit your 'feelings'.

We're getting stuck in this loop, this is what's causing the divide.  Our addiction to the rage.

It doesn't stop here, because even thinking along these lines fuels the addiction, and still requires you ""take a side"".

Well, as a country how can we stop?  How do we stop being pitted against each other by flashy graphics, and auto-play articles that shove a narrative down our throats?  

People are dying over false information and it only leads to more confusion and demands from the same people who ingest the damaging content in the first place.

depression," (Not only has my processing speed and short-term memory declined rapidly since my start on what was initially Zoloft, but my transfer to Prozac is seemingly producing the same injurious effects that I procured from Zoloft, enticing me to believe that I am mentally deficient; further accentuating my depression. However, despite that, my OCD's symptoms are now not at all relevant.

I am incredibly tired all of the time, my attention-span has decreased in such a way that I am now unable to read, which was a general engrossment of mine prior to this upheave of pernicious, adverse effects; and I am more suicidal than ever. Assumingly, my sudden spurge in suicidality probably has to do with my spontaneous decrease in cognition.

My psychiatrist does not want me to stop taking the SSRI; I am also unwilling to call the emergency services come the day when my suicidal thoughts get out of hand for reasons that might seem idiotic; therefore, I will not elaborate. Though my mother's insurance covers nearly every psychiatrist we've contacted, yet none of them are accepting appointment requests at this time for reasons unspecified; however, it is safe to assume that either (one), coronavirus is affecting their schedules or (two), they are very meticulous when accepting minors.

Though dichotomous with my previous statement, I feel as if going to the emergency room might benefit my desire to get another opinion.)

I can feel that I am slowly pulling into that deep and dark well. This had happened before. I was young then. 18. 

I woke up one morning. It was 8 o'clock. I decided to take some spare clothes for myself and leave the house. I couldn't breathe. When the garbage truck approached our house, I opened the heavy iron door and left for no reason. But I needed to. 

I would go to a remote city and commit suicide. I was just walking around for a few days. Purposeless. I bought myself a bottle of vodka and two boxes of sleeping pills. I rented a cheap hotel room and drank them all. Then something happened and I gave up. I got up and vomited everything. 

I went back and forth between sleep and wakefulness for three days. then I returned home as if nothing had happened and went to university. 

I feel it again. Slowly. I feel like I felt when I woke up that morning. Except It's 2 in the morning. My husband didn't even come to bed. Because instead of fucking me, he wank and film himself. I don't know why.

depression,"
Its effected the way i look at life

That why im kinda okay with it


It makes me so self aware or something




And ive always found life

And the world unimportant


Like there are like


Spiritual things way more important


And like the universe

And eternity shit

Time shit

And mind shit

Im probably talking bullshit

And probably bc im mentally ill

But i don‚Äôt care

And it will maybe change bc borderline make you change the way you think alot

I feel like

I shouldn‚Äôt believe this

Bc I actually think

There is nothing more to than just this

But something makes me believe this now

And I don‚Äôt care about life

So im just gonna believe en do whatever i want


Bc all of this isn‚Äôt worth anything

Like actually psychical life


And even if there wasn‚Äôt spiritual things


I don‚Äôt care bc life isn‚Äôt worth anything
  

Its just how i feel


Iknow it sounds crazy

Iknow 

I am aware 

But idc


The way i see life


There will never be a reason to think otherwise


Im doing the things i want


Bc i don‚Äôt care

Even if thats doing nothing all day


Bc it doesn‚Äôt matter


Bc doing things I don‚Äôt want isn‚Äôt living the life the way i want


Bc nothing really matters and is i guess good enough for me everything is boring


Everything feels empty sometimes 

I just found out i have alot of symptoms of dissociating  i never realized it wasn‚Äôt normal 

Sometimes i kinda feel things and i forget, im distracted of how i feel

And when i‚Äôm alone i can understand myself better and that feels good i hate being around people sometimes 


Especially lately maybe its just a bad few days but thats how i feel now and i feel it very deep 


It must mean something 


I just wish i was never born


These feelings are very complicated and weird 


Its just not worth it to even live while this is how i feel bc nothing will ever be fun


But i also never want to feel different bc i feel this so deep its kinda comforting 

Also when i feel and think alot about this i forget any other feelings and forget how i felt before this 


But iknow I feel this way all the time but i just kinda forget about it bc im distracted and than i forget about the feeling I actually feel or something 


I have to do so many things i need to be in a different mind state for but I can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt want to bc i would hate it either way

There is no way out


I need to go to school and work at the daycare don‚Äôt think i can handle that. Its something I don‚Äôt want to do but i have to do so i wish i wanted to do it and they deserve it bc they are people who want to help me but i can‚Äôt have help 

I can‚Äôt ga any other way bc i will hate life everyway 


There is now way out for me bc I don‚Äôt want to think any other way but also i need to think different bc i will fuck life up and it will be boring and then there isn‚Äôt anything to like about life there still isn‚Äôt anymore but later it will be even worse 

Bc i give no effort bc im lazy and i don‚Äôt think its worth it bc i don‚Äôt want to i do things I don‚Äôt want to do and i know that sounds so dumb but I can‚Äôt think any other way bc nothing matters so why would i even do things I don‚Äôt want


I  can‚Äôt explain it 


Its just too much or something but i need it and I don‚Äôt want to have help with not thinking this way bc I don‚Äôt think its worth it I can‚Äôt help it 



The only way out is dying 


But i‚Äôm too scared to kill myself 


Iknow this sounds stupid but I decided to believe a few videos its so stupid iknow i sounds stupid but nothing matters and if those videos give me a little hope for dying i guess i will take it 


So I won‚Äôt be afraid to die or kill myself 


 But still afraid to kill myself 



i wish i wasn‚Äôt 



I know i sound maybe so crazy for people who don‚Äôt look at it my way and im just crazy but I don‚Äôt care why would life be important to me


You die there isn‚Äôt really anyway of it even ever meaning something and I don‚Äôt even need it to mean something bc it just doesn‚Äôt either way




I wished i wanted help to think otherwise 


But I don‚Äôt want to bc this is actually how it is nothing can change my mind 



The only way out is dying 


But im too scared 


Im living in a endless loophole of agony

depression,"I apoligize if there is a better subreddit for this but I need help.

I will do my best to make a long story short.

I am 26, I have struggled deeply with depression and anxiety. It has hindered me severely and I just finally started to get my shit together. I take medication, I (before covid) saw a therapist weekly, I was finally able to face the day and handle my depression (yay)

My mother however, has not. She has severe depression and is too stubborn to take care of herself. She has been in and out of the hospital since I was 19 for alcohol related diseases. Got sober for 2 years, and started drinking again. Today I called her (I call my parents every day. I live 30 mins away and visit about every 2 weeks) to tell her how proud I was of myself that I did very well on my accuplacer test to go to community college after 9 years of being out of school and having shitty dead end jobs and wallowing in my own self pity. But she sounded very fucked up. Perhaps drunk but more
... opiate downer type of fucked up and she informed me she has pancreatitis again and the doctor wants her to go to the hospital immediately but she refuses.

My father had never gone to a doctor since before I was even born. Last year the pain got to be too much and I convinced him to go. He did, and he has been a trooper ever since going to his cancer treatments. He starts radiation next week. 

There is much more to this but I'm trying to not write a novel.

I love my parents but I feel so alone in this.
 They are both very ill and I know through therapy that they are grown adults and I have no control over their decisions if they refuse to hear my input. However, perhaps I'm being selfish, I am trying very hard to overcome depression and live my best life but I feel that phone calls and visiting is not enough. I dont know what to do anymore, my depression has come back full force today and my thoughts will not stop racing with thoughts of how my parents will die before I get married, have a baby, yadayada. I dont want to lose them. I dont know how to take care of them. My head is spinning. I need help.

depression,"My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.","My life has been a mess for years and I don't know what to do anymore, please help me.",scor6879,2020-06-20 02:27:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hce2sj/my_life_has_been_a_mess_for_years_and_i_dont_know/,1,1.0,2,19,1131

depression,"Usually when bad things happen I can turn my brain off and give it time but tonight was a little rough.  I'm best friends with a guy who has lots of other friends.  Generally we game and he wants to make sure he has time to hang out with everyone because he has kids and a difficult job.  We play lots of games together and some nights my friend would get off but in order to try and be friendly I stay on and continue playing with his friends.  I handle the ""Bro"" humor and locker talk and the jokes about race that don't always sound like jokes as much as I can but eventually the trend became that my friend would get off and they would all talk about how his wife is a freeloader and a ""C\*\*\*"" who only got pregnant to ""lock him in"" so that she wouldn't have to get a job.  It got to the point where they had a conspiracy theory that his wife was using her pregnancy as a way to get her friend a place to stay at there house as a nanny.

I abruptly stopped hanging out with the other guys and told my friend that I'd only be able to hang out with him because I don't want to stop him from associating with the people he likes, but I can't keep having myself mentally drained every weekend just so I could hang out with my friend.  

It came to a head tonight when he mentioned us all playing together again and I said no again and listed off all the reasons above for a 4th time and was told ""I'm always being so weird about these things and I don't know what context those things were said in"" and ""they've never said it to me"".

It's just really challenging because I want to hang out, and I want to remain friends because when we hang out alone and in other friend circles (cookouts, our mutual friends) we get along great.

I've been feeling crushingly lonely, feeling like I'm not a real functional adult, calling myself a retard because of my mental health issues, having no hope for anything to get better and honestly some days I've been wishing I just wouldn't wake up the next morning. 

The thing is, the last couple of days, due to being extremely busy with college work and me just being my forgetful self, I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication. And weirdly enough, with me not taking my meds, I've felt...better? I've realized I was maybe being a bit too hard on myself, and I'm feeling a bit more optimistic and hopeful than I have lately. 

I'm on 100 mg of sertraline daily for OCD and anxiety disorder. It's interesting to me because according to Wikipedia, sertraline is a serotonin inhibitor. I was wondering if this might be contributing to the depression I've been struggling with. I do plan on talking to my doctor about this the first chance I get, but I was just wondering if anyone else has had issues with anxiety meds or any other type of medication making depression worse?

After high school, I became a little more open just because the college that I'm at forced me too. After the Corona Virus had shut everything down. It was almost as if I had returned to the same spot that I was at in high school. Like there wasn't really a change in routine. 

I think that even when I was in grade school I would use video games as an escape from life. I still play video games now but I have been shying away from them because whenever I play them, all they ever seem to do is make me angry.

Earlier today I watched the losing a battle video from game theory and it inspired me to open up about my depression. I watched it and I had never heard of Ronnie oni Edwards before but after hearing his story I feel like I need to talk about this. I have been very, gloomy over the past few days. It all started when I texted this girl and we started talking and then she started calling me baby and sending hearts and stuff. I felt like someone actually liked me and I was hype. The next morning she said she liked someone else and only liked me a little bit. It happened again with someone else a few weeks later, they were just easier and nicer about it. Then, someone said they liked me, said yes when I asked them out and blocked me on all social media as soon as I went to bed. Now onto my parents. They are supportive and they buy me tons of stuff like video games. But as soon as I mess up, they yell at me and call me disrespectful and everything. They don‚Äôt know about what happened with the 3 girls and I‚Äôm afraid to tell them because they most likely won‚Äôt understand. I play bass btw and they are incredibly supportive of that. Too supportive, when I‚Äôm playing video games my dad says ‚Äú you should play you‚Äôre bass‚Äù and I already did that day. To be fair they have toned down pushing bass. But now onto the insecurities. I am insecure about my looks, my weight, my voice, and my everything. I have self harmed however it was very minor and I only left one mark for around a week.

depression,"It feels dramatic to say this but more and more I realize people don't have sympathy for mental illness.

When people yell at me or are disappointed in me for various reasons like not living up to expectations, I try to tell them my problems and worries. But then I end up in this endless loop.

If I don't try at all, or people perceive me to not be trying, they get mad. Because ""only you can solve your problems."" So it's random suggestions like exercise, hobbies, sunlight, lots of self help type things.

But as soon as I try to cope with my situation and seem slightly successful, people automatically assume that I'm fine and that gives them carte blanche to push their expectations back on me and subject me to the normal flow of life and stress.

I've talked about things like memory issues, focus, stress, obsessing over mistakes, mental fog. And I get this generic ""everybody makes mistakes.""

And yh would be writting all of these things to my friend but yh probably fcked that relationship with her aswell, i helped her get through alot of hate and probably made her trust people again but at end of the day i am the only one left in my own hole, for some time it was fun and useful for me to talk to her and stuff like and when i mean useful i mean for my mindset useful because i think there isnt a person with which i feel the same and at the end of day that person wouldnt leave me. I can talk whole day about alot of things which are on my mind but who cares. Simple to say believe and you will be okay hearing that shit for like 5-10years nothing changed i mean it kinda did but in the bad side. Worst part that i can relate to basicaly all the depressed songs i listen to. I wont do shit to myself bcs or i am to strong or i am to scared who knows and who cares right? I mean it will be one person which would say i care yh it might help for that moment and thats it... have a good day or night might some will have it  but definetally not me",Dont read it waste of time,Vorkarth,2020-06-19 23:29:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcbbok/dont_read_it_waste_of_time/,1,1.0,2,6,459

depression,"First time making a thread on Reddit, let me know if I did not follow any rules.

My friend that had depression for at least 5 years just recently told me about his visions brought on by his depression.

These visions included seeing a face appear in front of him while watching a movie. The face appeared closer to him than the screen so he knew it was not part of the movie. His father was also present and did not see the image. 

The other hallucination he had was during his sleep. His vision included a demon-like figure that was hovering above him and his body was jerking up and down rapidly. A very supernatural seeming experience by his description. 

I recently heard of someone's daughter that had depression related to her auto-immune disorder and she had visions of her family members faces transforming into scarier faces.

I had pretty severe depression for about 6 years but never had any sort of hallucinations. I had worries that included me thinking I may hallucinate but never did.

How common are these types of visions? Has anyone figured a way to get them to stop or at least help them?",Vivid horror visions due to depression,EmperorIngB,2020-06-19 23:23:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcb7z4/vivid_horror_visions_due_to_depression/,0,1.0,2,6,195

depression,"I [26M] have been battling my depression since I was young, diagnosed when I was 16 and got on meds when I was 19. Stayed on the meds for 2 years and what I learnt was, I could control the depression when I saw signs of it coming (like the really bad states, you know?). Things like; elevated mood in the morning followed by utter disgust with myself and my life because I spilt some coffee on my shirt, the normal stuff right? Well, a lot of this changed when I met my wife to be. I do NOT promote codependency as I believe we all should learn to love ourselves, but wow did she save me. The overwhelming positivity she has for life seemed to counteract my relentless pessimism and depression. 

A quick aside: I moved from Australia to live in England which is where I met my wife. After dating for a short time (3 months) she informed me that her family was moving to the US. Young and in love I decided I had no reason not to join her, so I moved over to follower her. I started studying college here which allowed me to stay...for now.

Well fast forward, we got married and soon after started a family, a beautiful boy. This was all seemingly fine as I had a good job after graduating from an A.S. But alas, will all steps in my life it seemed to be fruitless. I couldnt qualify for a work visa and so I had to either leave the country, or reenroll in school. I chose the latter obviously and sadly we had to move back in with the in laws. 
If there is anything worse for depression, its stripping someone of all their I dependence, their privacy and freedom to use money. 
We are now expecting baby number 2. I know what you're thinking, ""idiots, why?"" We had it a planned out believe it or not. She was about to receive citizenship and then I could legally apply for my permanent residency. Then...covid. Now throughout this time my mental state has been gradually decreasing. I slowly isolated my self, lost the ability to smile and joke around and then finally and most detrimentally lost my sleeping and eating patterns. 

When I wasnt a parent, this behaviour was unacceptable. Now that I'm a parent, it's a fucking joke. I am so stressed, so petrified that I am going to mess my children up. Not only because their father is unable to care for himself, but he snaps at them and expects way too much. 
I am so shit that I get mad at my 16month old son that he doesnt listen to me....he's a fucking infant, what's wrong with me? 
People are now commenting on my behaviour all the time, like I control this fucking disease. ""Why not have fun?"" ""Why doesnt he talk?"" ""How does he sit in the room all day?"" Because I'm fucking depressed!!! 
My wife asks me to describe why I can't try harder and don't blame her, but I replied like this. ""You know when your shoe gets caught in the mud, you try to pull it out but it begins to pull your shoe off? Well inside my mind is the depression (the mud) pulling all the happiness and rational thought straight off/out (the shoe). You cant just rapidly pull out of it, or you're left without a shoe. So, you stand in it and wait and hope slowly pulling it out will fix the issue."" But this time...it hasn't fixed it. 

To cap this all off. We think we now have to move back to England, which I'm happy about (the US is not for me, no offense) but I am scared to death. How am I going to provide for my family? How can I afford rent? They basically wont give two shakes about my US degree, it's not useful to them. How have I done this? How have I messed it up this bad. Why am I always such a friggen failure? How can I fail my family like this?

depression,"I'm just gonna write this down without thinking about it, I can't take this all for myself anymore

I've had depression twice in my life, one diagnosed and one that I've took alone, and I'm 19y/o

I know I shouldn't give any importance to this problems, cause a lot of worst things will come in life, I try to focus on that but I just can't anymore.. all I want is for everything to fucking end.

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years now, and her parents are the only people I've ever felt hatred towards in my life.. they treat her below shit, they have all life, she has dozens of scars on her body because of everything she's been through.
We both live in a small town in Portugal, she lives on my street, 3 houses apart, and she doesn't enter my house in almost an year at this point. We have to have sex in abandoned homes, or find any other crazy solutions at the little time she has alone. 
She works for them in a small cafe at our home town, she's been there since summer 2018, and things have just gone worst every single day.

They never paid her 1 cent. She opens the cafe every single day (no days off, last time she had one was last summer.) at 7am, alone, cleans, prepares everything for the day, does everything til the hour her parents wake up (they never set up an alarm, they sleep how many hour they want), that's usually close to 10:30/11:00AM, they go down to the cafe, she has to prepare lunch for the 3 of them, always, no chance for switching, while they sit on the fucking chairs doing go knows what. When a client shows up they call her (this also happens while their behind the counter), so she has to leave the lunch, come from the kitchen, do their job at the counter, receive the payment, and go back to slavery.

She can't get out of the house. She stays at the cafe from 7AM to 11PM (only because of Covid-19, before it was close to 2/3AM, without breaks in between) all she wants to do afterwards is to sleep, she doesn't even look at her phone while she's at home, this has been going on for an year. She can't get another job because they threaten to kick her out and she has absolutely no money, place to stay, anything in her name, anything, she's a complete fucking slave.

I don't know what I can do anymore, all I can see everyday is their face, happy, laughing, eating the food she makes them, making jokes about the situation, all I want I wanna do is kill them.
I got a job for this summer, If I rationalise my money at the point of not buying anything except food and hygiene I'll have close to 2k by the end of the summer (have some money I gathered from random 1 day jobs and last summer's job) but how will I get her out of this hell, of this fucking town with 2k? I'm completing high school in a couple of weeks, I have dream grades, no going to college with the opportunity I have would be a crime.

I just don't know what I can do anymore, I've been drowning this in drugs, alcohol, anything I can get inside to forget that I'm still here, only because she couldn't take it if I did it once and for all, I think about it more and more every single day, I lost so many people because of these thoughts, of this situation, from life friends to family, I can't remember most of this year cause I was sober from everything only for a couple of weeks, I don't even know myself anymore, I want the old me, I want everything back, I wanna talk and not explode, I wanna be sober from everything but I can't

depression,"Hello Reddit.

(M/17) Yesterday, I visited a psychiatrist who said that I have probably a Bipolar Disorder with a current Severe Depression. (I had 1x ""Hypomanic"" episode  and a Severe Depression in 2018/2019) My last ""Hypomanic"" episode was a month ago and after that my mood was getting worse and worse. Mostly I lay in my bed, watch some videos, look on reddit or sleep. My problem is, I always compare my current state with my in 2018/2019. Because it was much much worser than. Because of that I have thoughts like ""Im faking it"", ""I just want attention"" ""Others have it much worser than me"". This thoughts increased after I felt pretty okay yesterday, rather said better than usual. I was still unmotivated and did absoluty nothing, but I didn't felt so empty than before. And now even though, I know that alcohol is not good while your depressed. I have the urge to drink it, so that my depression gets worse.

Is this normal or do I have a big problem?

(I apologize if my english is not that well, it's my secondary language and I often make mistakes because I'm overthinking everything)

Edit: One more thing, I had a suicide attempt in my last depression. I tried to kill me with some fucking Ibuprofen and it was not even close to a lethal dose. I'm feeling like a fucking stupid loser because of that. I tried a suicide and failed so miserably. I feel like the doctors laugh at me because, I was not smart enough to kill me...

Edit 2: I'm being honest with you, I drank now my  first glass of Vodka and Energy. And I give up, fuck everything, I'm such a messed up person. I deserve to be depressed. Nobody should be wasting he's energy to be around some person who is so exhausting and annoying.

Edit 3: Uhh, Sorry. I apologize for oversharing myself. I hope I bothered no one. Sorry for making so many edits, sorry. I'm really sorry.",Is it normal to have the urge of doing things thats worsen your state,sewersfevers123,2020-06-19 22:29:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcaanp/is_it_normal_to_have_the_urge_of_doing_things/,2,1.0,2,14,334
depression,"When I was younger, I used to always go for pieces of media that would give me knowledge or provoke critical thinking. Watch things about ancient history or myths, true crime, how the brain works, different countries and it's cultures, etc. I would be excited to read books and go through them like it's nothing. On top of that, I'd speak so eloquently and have such vocabulary. I'd go out of my way to do things that would spark my imagination or get my brain working.

Now, I'm 29. I just watch stuff involving comic books or figures and statues. True crime stuff gives me anxiety. I just read comic books. I stutter, not understand certain words or use them incorrectly. I just refresh social media over and over again. I spend money to feel something and then be hit with regret immediately after.

I'm genuinely depressed in realizing the vast differences between then and now. It's like I failed myself.

depression,"A friend of mine is now 20, she has depression since she was 15. She is on no meds as she hopes to get better without them. I grew mushrooms for her, she now takes .1g every third day and it does not seem to help. I made her visit a psychiatrist in the past, he just gave her some meds that she never took because he seemed to be careless, and she really hates everything that looks like a pill and sees only flaws in each med... 

I need someone to elaborate on this with me. I'm seeking some real change for her other than her waiting for it to get better. She talks to me about it, but only when she gets really bad, she does not want to bother me, she wants to solve her problems and not bother anyone, but I'm the one who she messages or calls when she gets really bad. Today was an another such day. She has a boyfriend and spends time with her parents, she is not lonely.

She has panic attacks,  is afraid of herself and afraid in general. If there is someone with such experience: Would you, my fellow human, go for full blown psychedelic trip (I'm sort of psychonaut, done some trip sitting, not to anyone depressed so far, I read books to get better at it) or make her go to a psychiatrist again and start taking the damn pills (it takes a while to make her go to a doctor, but I can make her go there if it is needed)?

She is not totally passive, she wants to get better. She just attempted to go keto to make her mental health better, but she failed as the initial phase is just too hard for her mentally. She has similar symptoms that Mikhaila Peterson had, just not that severe.

depression,"Last week I did well on the 2nd interview for a job that could be really good for me, and soon I'm supposed to find out if I got it, but in the meantime I've been worrying and feeling scared about what might happen to my mental health if I don't get it. 

I've been going over the interview in my head and wondering if there was any little thing that the interviewer might hold against me. I made sure to be polite and enthusiastic, do my research, go the extra mile by familiarizing myself with a program the company uses, reiterate my flexible skill set and desire for growth, and nail all the objectives while dealing with the sample client, but I'm afraid that I somehow did something wrong or I didn't quite make the right impression on the interviewer. It also doesn't help that I don't know how just many positions are being filled or how many candidates there are, and during this pandemic it seems really likely that someone more qualified or more experienced than I am might have made it this far, too.

Doing well on the interview boosted my mood a bit for a few days, but now I feel it dipping back down again, and I'm worried that getting rejected will cause another spiral into suicidal thoughts.

depression,"A few weeks ago I had one of the worst depressive episodes of my life, to the point where I don't really know how I'm still here. It lasted about a month and seemed to come about for no reason and then seemed to leave suddenly with no warning. Only thing that's changed in the last week was that I had regular contact with a few more people than I usually do. This has me wondering if one of my triggers is a lack of social contact.

This doesn't make sense though. I've been an introvert my entire life and I don't like being in groups of people because I'm worried I'll get judged for whatever reason (i know it's dumb but that's where my brain goes) and the only time I don't feel like that is when I've downed a bunch of vodka for pre drinks or something. For me to get depressed without a bunch of people to talk to while simultaneously feeling uncomfortable around people because I think I'm weird feels like a cruel joke.

depression,"I'm just rambling because today has been a very tough day for me mentally and I cannot open up to my friends since they are the kind to not want to hear depressing shit but still message me to vent. It's my fault I allow them to but I like being able to be an outlet for them. Anyways...I grew up in a very strict Muslim home and from a very young age I've been questioning religion and at the age of 23 I decided I'm not going to follow religion. Parents don't know but can clearly see I'm not a fan. Yet they keep forcing down religion down my throat. Not to mention I'm a closeted gay so I've just been holding an entire part of me back for years. It's fucked me up mentally just not being able to express myself how I genuinely want to and always having to think how I will come across. I honestly feel like I'm still mid teens even tho I'm mid 20. They allow my brother to be free but always force this Muslim shit on me. Always making comments how I'm looking like a sheikh or like I'm an Arab trying to force this ideal on me to want to be like that. My dad is like a ticking time bomb with anything always ready to pop off and argue about anything. He has never apologized about anything he's said to anyone in this house. He literally told my brother that he will cut off his head because he tried to stop my dad from fighting my uncle. I've literally gotten beaten up when I was a teen because my dad didn't think I put enough effort in a project about religion even when I scored high on it. He's just a piece of fucking shit. Loves to act like he's not an ass when he's with other people. I don't have friends near to my home so I'm usually on my PC talking via a call or something. And my dad had a huge problem with that. He hates to see me on my computer even though he lives behind his phone 24/7 and only uses his earbuds when he watches porn like if he's fooling anyone. I have horrible sinus allergies. This morning I woke up feeling like shit because I slept with my fan on a speed higher than one because it was hot last night. I just ate and took some meds and went back to sleep. I didn't even realize today is Friday and we have to go to mosque. Had I known I would have just toughed it out because as I said he's a time bomb and you know he's a saint in his eyes because he prays. I woke up to him shouting at my mom because she saw me sleeping when it was time to leave and he went off on this huge argument about how I'm always on the computer late at night and why don't I love to pray one a bunch of other shit. It's so fucking depressing to be surrounded by people who don't and will never accept who you truly are (meaning in the house not my friends) and I get so fucking jealous when I see gay kids and my friends being able to live how they want and not have to be forced to live a certain way or follow a certain religion. Everyone just wants me to be my brother. They want me to be muscular and handsome and look like a Muslim and have all the girls after me and have a job and be charismatic. I know everyone will say I'm 26 I can leave but it's not possible for me right now. I've fucked up my life and I'm trying to un fuck it but it's not getting better. I've spent my day so far thinking about my life and what I've accomplished and I've come up with nothing. Every night I fall asleep wishing I don't get up, when I'm out I hope someone comes with a fucking gun and blows my head off. I really don't fucking understand how I can be brought into this world and not be able to be my own person. I didn't fucking choose to be here and yet it's my fucking fault for everything bad in this home. Note made the mistake of telling my mom I'm depressed the last time I tried to commit suicide and she told my dad who told me I'm like this because I need to pray. The fucker didn't even ask me how I'm doing or if I need to see a therapist or anything. Killing my self the last time I tried really didn't help anyone especially myself.

depression,"I apologize if this isn‚Äôt the perfect place for this post. I need help and if anyone can give me guidance, I appreciate it. 

Ive been diagnosed with a digestive disease called Ulcerative Colitis. It has made my life hell. Long story short I‚Äôve been shitting blood and having so much stomach pain in the past few months. 

Today, I finally managed to find a place that would do an exam called Colonoscopy. That is there they send a camera up your rectum to find the cause of the bleeding.

The problem is they require someone to sign me out of the hospital. I HAVE NO ONE. No friend. No family. 

I want to emphasis just how hard it is to:

A). Find a place that does it at an affordable price

B). Just how badly I need this exam

Therefore, I cannot cancel the exam. That‚Äôs out of the question. Question is, how do I find someone to sign me out of hospital?

Obviously there‚Äôs a reason behind this policy (for the smartasses who‚Äôll be commenting). But, this really puts pressure on people who have no one to help them.

depression,"I woke up in a terrible mood, still suction cupped to my bed until I absolutely had to go to work.

On my walk there, in and out of panic attacks, someone almost hit me with a car on the sidewalk.

Got to work shaking, feeling slightly manic, not sure if I should even be into work today.

I got right into it - sanitizing everything, cleaned the bathroom, swept all the floors and started organizing part of the store I haven't touched yet - the utility closet.

I'm the new manager here so the utility closet, the smoke room and the basement are still places I want to whip into shape (and one employee...oh well).

Suddenly the person that owns a live music place next door offered me a job. I won't take it - last time I worked at a place that served alcohol, I ended up picking glass out of a co-worker's skull. He had to get 18 stitches and my ptsd just can't take it but it was really nice that he thought that I would be a good fit.

So after that confidence boost (cuz people see the work I'm doing and want me to also work there? that's so nice) I found purpose in bringing up all the old furniture in the basement that everyone else is afraid of.

I've made $15 already for the store and found a huge mirror that I gave myself a pretty good deal on.

Then the person that took most of the furniture happened to live upstairs from the shop. He said that he runs several businesses and can already see that cleaning his giant apartment is going to be a problem for him.

Boom, scored a job I'd do once every few weeks for a little extra cash and/or weed. I also freakin LOVE cleaning. That's all I am going to do tomorrow at my own place.

I suppose these instances themselves didn't turn my day around. I realized whilst typing this out that I am in such a place in my life and mental health that all the little things I do for myself day to day really helped to boost my happiness over the last 24 hours.

Every time I'm doing well, I do everything I possibly can like premaking something simple to warm up over the next few days, etc, just in case depression hits and I can't take care of myself like I should.

Idk, I guess I just wanted to post an update because yesterday I thought this bout was going to last for weeks the way it felt. But I think I'm breaking free from it already.

Remember, even though it sounds empty until you can feel it for yourself but things can get better.

depression,"So these past few weeks I've been getting extremely frustrated with my girlfriend, every time she opens her mouth I hate what comes out. It's usually something she thinks is funny or something. She ALWAYS says stuff but then like changes it later, but then she said I should never listen to her, but she gets mad when I say one or the other. Like she never takes care of her teeth, and every time I say she never brushes her teeth she gets offended but sometimes says she doesn't. But today she finds out she had gum disease. She is immature and irresponsible, but I know I am too, I am irresponsible, but I feel more responsible. Sometimes I feel like our relationship is bad, but I don't know what I'd do without it. She can be suicidal and I feel like If I left her she'd do something. But I love her, but I need her to grow up. I need her to keep myself from cutting, I need her for comfort, I need her because she is everything I have, I need her because she is my best friend. I know I'm a shit person for feeling this way, but I have trouble caring when my girlfriend talks about why she is sad because it doesn't make sense to me, it's not rational, but I know that that's not nice. she sometimes tells me that she and her parents 'notice' something I did that was rude, but lately every time she opens her mouth I get pissed. She had amazing parents who she could talk to and they'd listen. She is always sad but only because of me. I get so jealous of her life even though she had depression longer. She is the one who tried to commit suicide many times, several during our relationship. I get angry and feel like she is selfish for not appreciating the good she has. My parents are divorced and my mom is a bitch to my dad. My mom leaves every day to be with her boyfriend, and my girlfriend knows my mom is bad. She hates her more than I do  


Last week I got the news my grandpa passed away. I was told it was swelling or a clot, but during the funeral, I found out he shot himself. I found out he was struggling with the same problems as me. He was annoyed at his wife, he was annoyed at the world. I know I am just like my grandpa, he wrote down every symptom, every medication he took, and every problem it had, he would be horrified of every shot he got, ask his wife if it was red or swollen, or crawling bugs.... when I learned that, I knew I was just like him. I write down all my symptoms, I write down the concerns I have about my relationship. I wish I could have talked to him before he died. I could have helped, we could have helped each other. My dad lost his dad and now his wife (my stepmom) is in the hospital barely hanging on. She had a few seizures earlier this year but the doctors overlooked it. When they got to TN to be with my grandma, she had non stop seizures and is in the hospital. She missed the funeral and her kidneys are starting to fail. They don't know why, and my dad is worried. My dad won't be back for another 2 weeks or until she gets out of the hospital. I lost my friends when I moved with my girlfriend to another school. I feel like our relationship is extremely toxic but I can't let her go.

I talked to the crisis text line and pretty much just said the same stuff, but even after repeating it, I feel no better. I can't afford any more doctors or psychological help.

Furthermore, I‚Äôm not very good with this sort of thing because I have a very low emotional intelligence.

depression,"I think about death every day now. EVERY DAY.  My depression is getting out of control and I can't even think coherently anymore.

I have been depressed since I was a teenager.  Grew up in a oppressive and restrictive family (couldn't make new friends at school, play athletics, which I excelled at, date anyone, participate in any extracurricular activities, etc). Attempted suicide at 17, and now as an adult, I feel more and more suicidal every day. 

I'm married, but our relationship isn't real.  We get along fine, but no sex, no real communication (we were both married extremely young and naive, and have grown distant).  She's in a religious cult, which has driven a wedge into our relationship.  As much as I really want to, I can't formally leave this cult or I'll be shamed and hard shunned by my entire family as well as hers. I'll lose everything I have in life. I'll be further made to look like a villain. My kids will be weaponized against me (already have to an extent, thanks to the fucking cult indoctrination, ie. the cult comes 1st in life, family, including dad, is 2nd). So, I'm stuck.  Thinking about death EVERY DAY. 

Have a steady, decent paying job with a medium sized company, but the President of the company called me mentally crazy for even thinking about leaving my wife's religious cult which he is also a member of (ironic).  So I'm trapped. I feel like I'm in a death trap.  I have started drinking heavily to cope and escape.

Single income with a mortgage, two car payments, 2 kids, so a divorce and life reset isn't an option. I'm fucked. Death seems like the only way out. Super selfish, I know. I love my kids so much, but I can't take it much longer and I can't help the feeling of wanting to blow my brains out.

For a while I thought I had it all under control (my depression, anxiety, ADHD and, bad coping mechanisms) but is was just the meds. I just hated how numb they made me so I stopped taking them. Then things got crazy. Virus, protest, violence, just crazy at every turn...

depression,"My experience with doctors, medication, and therapy have all been negative since I started trying to get help.

Every time I see my doctor, I end up waiting an hour. When I finally see him and try to explain what's going on, he cuts me off and says that he only has five minutes. All he needs to know is if I need a new prescription. I tell him that the medication isn't working, that it's making me too drowsy and I'm feeling worse. He just tells me to take more before leaving the room. I'm not his target demographic, and it shows. He only cares about seniors, babies, and women who want children/are pregnant. There are times where I think he's getting paid by companies to promote certain medications. He always tries to push the newest brand name products on me that cost hundreds of dollars.

Every medication that I've tried doesn't work. It doesn't change anything for the better. They just make me drowsy to the point that I'm a zombie and even more mentally fragile because I'm even more tired 24/7. I get withdrawal symptoms every time. More headaches. More irritability. More exhaustion and despair.

Every therapist that I've been to has made me feel like I should just end it and save everyone time. The drop-in therapists that I've seen all told me that I don't have real problems. They told me that wishing people cared about me is selfish, and that they all have bigger problems to worry about rather than me whining about non-issues. The multi-session therapists I've seen just tell me to be grateful for what I have, which just translates into me being ungrateful. They tell me that I should meditate and go for walks. Yeah, because I can *totally* meditate in a home environment where I have no privacy, and where trying to have some peace and quiet by myself is impossible. And sure, I can *totally* go for a walk when I feel anxious from just being in a public space, and I can *definitely* exercise when I have zero energy at the start of the day.

It's all pointless. It doesn't help. I just feel worse. All of this just proves that I don't deserve to be happy, and that I need to just shut up and accept my place in life. I'm never going to be loved. I'm never going to be cared about. I'm just someone to fill space until someone better comes along. I'm just someone for people to take their anger out on.

depression,"Hello everyone. I never wanted to talk about my life in a place like this but this is my last chance I guess. I am normally a person who can manage to throw it in and forget about it. But everything has been filled up in me to the point that I'm even crying while writing these lines haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try my best to keep everything tidy and short for you but it will still most likely be a long read. I apologize in advance. And if you feel like my problems aren't actually that big, I can't blame you, I'm also aware that there are people that goes under much more stuff and still manage to stay strong. The thing is, I'm not that strong.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next two paragraphs I will be giving some context and tell you how I got into this position. So I'm a male. If this was a year ago, I wouldn't even consider calling myself depressed or problematic at all. I was a great student in my school, I had really nice friends that would always support me and be on my side. But since the end of the last summer, my life is becoming progressively worse. I have always been a calm and quiet person. But I wasn't the socially gifted type. The reason for that is because my childhood wasn't the most pleasurable experience, if anything, it was damaging.

At the beginning of the 12th grade, everything was completely fine. All I had to do was to study for university exams, and I was keeping my grades really steady. I wasn't in a relationship, nor that I was desperately searching for one. But around December I got a girlfriend, who was already a good friend of mine for a long time. And she was perfect. I couldn't think of being with anyone else at all and even the thought of losing her was immensely painful. For a few months everything was mostly fine. My grades were still good. Our relationship was decent even though we would argue sometimes. But as time passed on, the things didn't go very well. My grades dropped fast, Our arguments got much worse, and my family was nagging me A LOT. And in the end she broke up with me, all because of my stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in a position that cannot be fixed at all.  Literally next week, I have a university exam I have been studying for a year and I am not prepared at all. In fact, I was more ready at the beginning of the year compared to now. And I don't even care to be honest. I have no drive to do anything. All the life energy in me feels like got pulled out completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationship between me and my family is getting worse too. My dropping grades was the cause at first. Then they started to get offended by my simplest actions and most innocent words (One example would be when I told my dad calmly that I didn't enter an online exam because no one else was entering either. He didn't talk to me for more than a week.). And recently I don't have any appetite, and don't feel like eating anything. This also causes my family to pressure me even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt like a person that could support other people when they need help (mostly because of my asocial background.). That's why I never talked about my feelings, since I didn't want people to provide me something that I couldn't return them back. But this never felt like a problem until this year. I was so weak at supporting my girlfriend that it would hurt our relationship more than anything. And not just that, but I also offended and hurt both my closest friends and my cousin (Who is literally like a big brother for me.) on the smallest things on multiple occasions. I should also say that this was the first time in my life that I ever offended my cousin. I tried to get better at social interactions but I f\*\*ked up really hard. 6 months passed and I only started to improve at my social skills recently. But it doesn't even matter anymore since I lost both my girlfriend and people around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel like my words don't have any effect on people unless I degrade them, swear at them, or simply talk bad to them. Whenever I apologize to people, say I feel sorry for them or say that I feel guilty for what I've done and I will take responsibility, no matter how sincere I am, they tell me that this is not enough and that they expect me to be more understanding. I do my best to encourage people, make them feel better, and make them laugh, but all my attempts seem to be unsuccessful. Due to this, I feel like everyone thinks that I'm the worst person alive. Whenever I tell someone something they interpret it in the worst way possible. And even when I thoroughly explain myself, it seems to have no effect on how they interpret my words.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I want to talk to someone about something that bothers me, either I get snubbed, or rebuffed. And when I try to make things better by saying stuff like ""Don't worry, It isn't that important actually, It doesn't bother me that much, I don't mind"" then they scold me for how I talk. I never felt much more weak in explaining myself ever before.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved life. I loved everything about it. The sounds of birds in the morning, crickets chirping at night, going for a swim in summer and drinking a hot tea in the winter... I can count lots of things that would  have made me happy. Now none of these makes me happy at all and I wish my life would just end instantly. I hate myself for saying these but I seriously want it to end. The only problem is that I am not courageous (or stupid, whichever way you want to interpret it) enough to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

This post has been really hard for me to make, and it is really lengthy despite me trying to cut most of the stuff. I apologize once again for taking your time, and thank you if you read through it all, it means a lot for me.

**TL;DR, This year has been really rough for me, my relationship with my family is worsening day by day, my girlfriend broke up with me due to how bad my social skills are and how stupid I am, my friends are slowly distancing themselves from me, I have a University exam that I'm not ready for and I started to wish that I wasn't born at all.**",I feel like my life is going downhill and I'm the only one that I can blame.,akininca,2020-06-19 17:50:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc5ag7/i_feel_like_my_life_is_going_downhill_and_im_the/,13,1.0,3,17,1132

depression,"Well that‚Äòs a long story but I am gonna tell you anyways because I really need your help. But before I start I wanna clarify that my depression is not diagnosed. I am not depressed but I think I am on the way to get there. So I am just gonna start: It all started when I had a girlfriend (her name was lisa) and I was in love so bad with her. But she broke up with me and I really didn‚Äòt know why so I kinda just had to realize it and go on living my life. Just a few weeks later a friend of mine invited me to a birthday party. I thought this could be the perfect way to get out of my fricking room and to do something. So I went there and obviously drank a ""little"". Well in the end I ended up chilling on a couch with a girl called Lilli. And she really seemed to be interested in me. So I was having hope and we did meet a few times after the birthday party. But she then somehow started ignoring me more and more and I really didn‚Äòt know why. So I went to ask her if everything was ok but she literally just turned and walked away. I shouted to her that if she isn‚Äòt interested in me she should tell me now. And all she said was ""well yeah"". And she left. My heart was broken again. I loved this girl and I fell even more in love with her everytime I looked into her eyes. I was done and I haven't really done anything with reallife friends since then (pretty much 2 months now). Do you think I need help, well because I think I do.",How it all started with my depression,RiseFX43,2020-06-19 23:20:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcb5xc/how_it_all_started_with_my_depression/,4,0.98,2,7,298
depression," My girlfriend is depressed. I feel as though I've exhausted all of our options, and I don't know what else to do. I've gotten her to make a habit of meditating, she's continuing to try medication, we've gotten her off of alcohol, nicotine, and weed, she's gone to therapy, I've now enrolled her in online therapy, and we talk at least once a day about it in addition to every night wherein it is followed by her crying herself to sleep.

I love this girl with everything in my being. She is truly the greatest person I've ever met, I've never talked to anyone who is a better fit for me. And she loves me intensely too, and she shows that every day.

Today she told me that she was upset but she didn't want me to know because she feels guilty for the toll her depression takes on me. Of course, she's right, it does take a heavy toll on me, but I feel incredibly guilty that she felt she needed to hide her feelings to spare mine.

I don't know what else to do for her.

1. Is it possible that she will never recover from depression, and that this will be our lives for the next 60 years? I can accept this if it is the case. Her with depression is a million times better (for me) than any neuro-typical person I've ever met.
2. Should I do more to help her, or do I need to step back for both our sakes?
3. If I should help her, what more can I do?

Note that I have also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but it is much more mild and I am medicated very well.","My girlfriend of a year and a half is depressed, what more can I do to help her?",WillTwerk4Karma,2020-06-19 23:18:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hcb4i5/my_girlfriend_of_a_year_and_a_half_is_depressed/,2,1.0,2,18,284

depression,"Probably in about July or August of last year I started to feel different, not terrible, but consistently only like 90% of normal. It wasn't a big deal because I just started exercising harder and more often, ate healthier, went vegan, started cooking for myself, reading more, spending a ton of time outside, doing well in school, etc. Basically every good thing you could be doing and I felt like a god.

But my parents wouldn't stop making me feel like shit about everything I did. No matter what I did it wasn't good enough and I started to hate coming home from school. I don't want to go into too many details but it culminated with my mum screaming at me as I left the house to go to a Christmas Party. It was so bad that I left an hour early and just sat on the street corner crying waiting for my friend to pick me up and take me to the party. I got completely wasted and don't remember much of the night. I could feel that I had just snapped and immediately felt like shit about everything. Since then I've just felt like garbage probably about 95% of the time.

I've lost all interest in everything I loved, and most of it actually makes me feel worse. Running, swimming, cooking, baking, eating healthy, exercising in general all make me feel worse about myself, but I already feel bad for not doing them. So I'm basically in a constant state of feeling like shit. I really briefly thought about suicide when I was feeling my worst, but I haven't thought about that in a few months.

I haven't been feeling this way for that long (6 months or so) but I hate it so much and I just want it to end. I really want to feel good about myself and life again.

I know this community isn't supposed to be used for specific advice, but I looked into anti-depressants and I just want to know if they might make me feel motivated to care about myself again, because I don't have any motivation and I really want to do those things again and be back to how happy I was when doing everything that I loved.

I've been swimming a bit with my friends, because they're the only way I can actually do anything healthy but I don't want to be reliant on them all the time just to feel good about myself.",I have lost all motivation and love for myself and the things I used to love and I really want to feel good again.,just_curious_private,2020-06-19 19:31:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc74yx/i_have_lost_all_motivation_and_love_for_myself/,0,1.0,2,24,412

depression,"When I was a kid, my mother isolated me (yes I know I was abused). She didn't let me hang out with friends except for at school, she never let anyone come over (I wouldn't want anyone over anyway the house never got cleaned), I wasn't allowed to go over to friend's houses, to their birthday parties, and I had to beg and throw a fit for her to let me talk to my friend over the phone. She told me I wasn't allowed to have friends. I would get embarrassed when friends showed up at my house out of the blue. My mom would get angry and yell and tell me to tell them to go away. 

Now I'm an adult and unfortunately I still live with my mother. I have a boyfriend and no actual friends. I always thought of myself as an introvert. I'm really quiet and can't communicate with people very well. I've been slowly but surely learning how to communicate the best I can. I never have anything to say, nothing to talk about, I can't express my feelings very well but I seem to do okay at expressing them in my relationship. I value my alone time but I would spend 24/7 with my boyfriend if I could (obviously I don't). On days like today, when I'm off work and my boyfriend is at work, I feel alone and depressed. I just spent 3 days with my boyfriend and I have to work for the next 4 days. You would think I would feel fine, but I don't. I have co workers who I have hung out with outside of work a few times. Part of me wants to see if they are available to hang out with but part of me doesn't. I only hang out with them when they invite me to and even then I don't go every time. I've also noticed that when I do hang out with someone, I'll enjoy myself for a bit and then I'll go back to feeling depressed. It's like, I want to be there but at the same time I just want to go home and lay down.

By the way, that's all I do by myself. When I'm alone, I don't have the energy to do anything. Some days I don't even get out of bed to go shower. I don't have energy to talk to anyone either. So, I have a limited amount of energy when I'm spending time with people. And absolutely no energy when I'm by myself. And, I'm really awkward around people and don't even have anything to say.

depression,"Hello everybody, 

my close relative has a serious mental health problem for years, she is functional most of the time, underwent a basic therapy and is on medication, but the problem persists, although major drops are somewhat less common (once or twice a week). There are some underlying, possibly related problems accumulated over years, both of psychological and physiological nature, but I do not want to go to details because it could derail the question I want to ask.

Basically, what I am looking for is someone who experienced similar symptoms and I want to ask what was your cause and how (if) did you cope with it. I am not looking for a medical diagnosis (can not be done online), but need a comparison and maybe it could help me to find another approaches to the situation.

Basically, she is in her 30s and experiences major drops of mood without a direct apparent cause. These are usually tied to being tired (like sleeping for less than 10 hours) or to an otherwise minor problem (like being unable to find something). Such preconditions do not launch the drop every time, it more seems like that the drop is present in background some days and waits for any inconvenience that can start it. The drop is accompanied by severe anxiety (""I do not belong here, I feel like in a trap, Everyone hates/should hates me, I am completely unable to do anything, I am doing everythong wrong""), passive aggression (""Say something, You all probably hate me, All the problems are there especially to hurt me, Do you really like living here with me etc.,) and general negativity (like refusing any attempts to being helped because of feeling that it will not work anyway). There is also a sort of tunnel vision - if an everyday problem started it, then she is unable to try a new approach to it and repeats the not working approach with increasing intensity until exhausted. The main phase, if not reinforced by any further negative experience, lasts for about half an hour, but the descent and reconvaslescence are both gradual. What is interesting is, that it is always accompanied by ache of shoulder muscles and increased sensitivity to pain both there and on other parts of body - even a slight touch is felt as painful. 
The condition returns in waves about every other hour, usually disappears for a few days after sleeping.

The medication she receives decreased length of the drops and their frequency, but seems not to work completely and it still comes too often and complicates her finding a job or raising her baby - she can not plan in advance, because any day can be the drop day. When she recovers, she is aware of the problem, but can not really recall how she felt, for example to tell the therapist in detail. She is able to discuss her problems openly otherwise, and sometimes notices that the drop is coming, but can not stop it.

everyone wants everyone to kill themselves. Everyone hates everyone. Itll be like this forever. No one will ever agree on anything and the division and hatred grows every minute. whats the point of going on if everyone hates each other. If i ever make a friend then as soon as we figure out that we have one iota of difference in opinions theyll hate me and dump me as a friend.

depression,"I don't even know where to start. If my loved ones look at me today from outside, my current life will look normal. I am going to get married to my fiance soon. We both are PhD students, earning decent stipends, have two pets, a healthy social circle and no major debts till date. I sometimes feel lucky to have my fiance who takes care of most of the stuff for both of us, like cleaning home, cooking, taking care of the cats (he has been working from home much before the lockdowns started). 

For me, there are days after days when I feel like I am just somehow clinging to this normal lifestyle, mostly because of my fiance. On the other hand, I feel sorry I have to make my fiance go through all this alone. I can sense he loves me but he definitely has some resentment. Our sex life is a mess, thanks to me. We hardly have any conversation, thanks to me. I hardly get up and do something wonderful for him. Sometimes I wish he could courage up and just leave me. He deserves way better life than one he is spending with me. I am not even courageous to break up with him because I love him too much and I am afraid if he leaves, that will be it for me. It frustrates me that I can't make him happy because of all this darkness inside me.

I didn't have a decent childhood or teenage years. I have seen my parents fight, even physically, throughout my life. I have been a victim of corporal punishment for smallest mistakes I would make because my parents themselves were depressed and frustrated. I have received beatings for which I still carry scars on my body and still have nightmares.  I have always been a bright child and would excel in academics and extra curricular activities. I decided to devote my life to academics, as it seemed to me the only way I got some validation from people around me and most importantly, validation from myself. My parents had a huge fall out during my high school and my father decided to kick us out,  remarry and send me to student hostel for preparing for college. I was low-key happy and thought this would be my way out from my childhood misery. I was so wrong. 

I hardly had any contact with my parents and my brother. I was stalked and harassed by a group of boys. Things escalated so quickly that this group kidnapped me, molested me, physically wounded me and left me to die on streets. It took me 7-8 months to physically recuperate but it messed up my academic progress, my mental health was shattered and I was in so much trauma I started having hallucinations, violent outbursts and black outs. My parents realized how much damaged I was and came to my aid. They stayed with me for next 1.5 years, tended to me, helped me recover and prepare for my college admissions. I ended up getting admitted in a good college with a major of my choice.

In college, I had a hard time scoring good in new, advanced subjects. I know grades aren't anything, but for me this is the one thing I thought I had, good grades for self-validation, and I saw that slowly slipping away from me. I got into a relationship and my ex didn't take even a year to cheat on me. I started having severe migraine attacks and soon seizures. My behavior changed, I had a fall-out with whatever friends I had made. Everyone stopped looking out for me, except my parents. But they were living in a different town, separated. I would bunk classes for days, stay in my bed for days without eating or any social contact. I was considered a relatively attractive girl in my college and that unfortunately invited a lot of rumors and false gossips on me. These small factors made things worse for me until I decided to call ot quits and run away. Thankfully my parents intervened, found me and sent me to all sorts of doctors. Medical intervention and professional counseling did help me significantly in getting better, both physically and mentally. It gave me strength for at least next 2-3 years to pull myself together and improve my life. I did. I managed to graduate with an above average grade, get a PhD offer in a decent research institution and started dating my current fianc√©. Things seemed positive and fine for me.

Cutting back to present, PhD life is not easy. Its a grueling phase of life every grad student has to go through. I am experiencing my share of failures and hopelessness in my research years. I developed PCOS that makes me suffer through intense abdominal pains at least for 3-5 days every month. I have my share of anxiety, mood swings and insomnia. Here is the deal. I feel like even smallest inconveniences in my life breaks me up. I still have nightmares from my past. I had a huge decline in my sex drive partly because I still have nightmares of what happened to me 9 years ago. No matter how much I try, I can't get over my past sufferings, always afraid that this is not the end of my sufferings and something really bad is going to happen to me that is going to shatter me. I feel so hopeless, guilty, disappointed in myself for losing my grip, scared of future and failures, scared of losing my relationship and at the same time feel guilty that I am doing injustice to the beautiful person my fiance is.

I don't feel like talking to my fiance because I know he had a decent past and he respects me for how I have overcome mine. I am afraid to open up to him, admit to him that I can't get over my past till date and that I think its highly unfair of me to expect him to share my grief and depression. I don't feel like getting professional help here in my grad school because there is just too many formalities. Its not like I get a walk in appointment and talk my heart out. I have lost my regular contact with my friends. When I try to talk to my mother, she insists I submit myself to religion and faith in God. I tried but it didn't work. I don't have faith in any gods. I am angry and frustrated that I still don't have a normal, pain free, anxiety and stress free life after going through so much.

Within 2 months of lockdown (my research suffered a great deal because of this) I could feel that feeling of emptiness, hopelessness, low self esteem, low mental and physical capacity, desire to do nothing, everything I suffered while clinically depressed few years ago, creeping back into me. I am obliged I am not interested in killing myself, but I am just becoming nihilistic. I have started abusing alcohol and Marijuana intake and hardly make any appearance in my social circle. My fiance is suffering because of all this. I know I have to pull myself back again for his sake. I don't know how. 

I am afraid I have to live with occasional bouts of hopelessness and pain all throughout my life and my past sufferings have done a permanent damage to me.",Is it possible to let go off your past ever for someone with a history of clinical depression?,dc_science,2020-06-19 18:03:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc5j48/is_it_possible_to_let_go_off_your_past_ever_for/,0,1.0,2,18,1247

my point is, do you ever have objectively good days yet still feel like a failure? like, objectively i am making good progress and you‚Äôde expect your head to be in correlation to that. my simp day didnt make it feel any more or less worst. unfortunately even in those really good days where things in hindsight are going well, im constantly at battle with myself and hating myself. what progress is being made if i cant turn my self-hatred around?

depression,"I don't know if it is depression as I just need a hope to keep things going which is an external factor . But I am feeling defeated not because I can't do things but because bad luck is not leaving me ,it has happened many times where the ball or opportunity slips from my hand.

Long story short: 
I am a deck officer in merchant Navy, joined this field due to financial hardships at home. Now, since 2015 my career growth has been tremendous slow to the point that I have cut down all communicatins with my pals as all of them are doing well .
I signed off from my ship in July-19 , I had gave readiness to my present company in Sep-19 but then they said me that I need to do some inhouse courses to join and this time they will give me promotion for 2nd officer which was long overdue.

Only thing was that course was scheduled in Jan-20, due to promotion thing I agreed ,and then after Jan-20 when I asked when I will be joining back to ship ,they said that it would be in Feb,but it would be at same rank and not promotional rank. Promotion will be subject to onboard appraisal and even then there is no guarantee this was said by a superintendent who is a captain btw, one of the most negative persons you will ever met.

Since Sep-19 I was trying for other companies , and luckily (or unluckily) My promotional thing was accepted by one of the largest ship management companies after clearing their interviews and all.

Then in Feb-19 , I did their in house courses ,gave my documents etc. ,they have already lined up for a ship where joining would be in April. 

And thanks to Covid-19 , everything got fucked up. 

But then in end-may, Government of India  started giving permissions for charted flights specially for seafarers. Most of my friends have gone back to their jobs., while I am still stuck and the new company is not even giving me any hope.

Since I had already given my documents and all to this new company, my present company won't entertain me as I haven't been keeping touch with them .

Now , I am in a very critical situation .
I am not able to pay the debts of a consumer loan which I had taken in nov-19 which is affecting my credit score and also huge interest of 36 percentage and also the bounce charges which is being levied by the bank .
 All mutual funds are in negative and I have stopped all the SIPs, Home loan is being taken care of due to moratrium but when the honeymoon period ends, I would be in deep shit. 
Many here might say ,that I should not have buy a house or taken a loan, let me tell you that that whole life I have lived in a 150 sq.ft room, and I atleast deserved to live a better life after slogging so much and then also I played quite safe and my EMI is still 20 percentage of my yearly earnings.
Every week , I am calling my new company and their response is abysmal ,now they say that the vessel which I had been lined up for has no sign off plans even for thr next month
It's not that this has happened for the first time, since I joined this field in 2009, I have been facing a very tough time both proffesionally and personally.
 I have not given up on myself ,but then it is getting very difficult to stay positive and think good when life gives you blow after blows.",Don't know If I am suffering from depression .Please hear me out guys.,damnjimmie,2020-06-19 12:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbzyfw/dont_know_if_i_am_suffering_from_depression/,1,0.86,5,13,614

depression,"So I have bad memory problems from what happened to me as a child, I blocked out a lot of the really bad things that happened as a self defence mechanism. I've had depression since I was 14 but it's only been diagnosed since 19 (when I finally moved out). I had no idea why I was feeling this way and was ashamed because I felt ungrateful for feeling that way. Recently I started remembering things that happen to me as a child. I'm the oldest of 3 girls and so I always felt it was my duty to protect my little sisters from as much abuse as possible. I suddenly remembered stuff like when my mom threw a hamper at me when I was 4-5 because she was running late for work, or when my dad and ex-stepmom we're having a fight because she thought it was unfair that her 3 year old daughters were getting less food than me 13 and my sisters 10 and 8. 
If this is the stuff that I'm only now remembering then what else happened that I don't remember? I don't know who else to talk to about this, I don't trust my parents to tell me the truth and I don't have any close friends. I've talked to my fiance about it but not as much as I would like because I don't want to sound whiny.

depression,"I don‚Äôt want to die, but a comfortable life feels like an impossible dream. I‚Äôm an 18 year old female (not sure if my gender is relevant but whatever) and I feel like my life is going to be an absolute train wreck. I don‚Äôt feel capable of achieving anything and I‚Äôm afraid to live alone. I don‚Äôt think I will ever find the right man and my standards for everything are so high. I just want life to be simple and enjoyable but I feel like it‚Äôll be unbearable, filled with things I can‚Äôt handle because I‚Äôm completely useless. 

I don‚Äôt feel a deep connection with most people, I feel so lonely, like I‚Äôm living behind a wall of glass and so is everyone else. I fear that my talents will never be recognised, and I will never be understood, seen and valued for who I really am. I don‚Äôt know if I will ever earn enough money to leave home and the people in my area and city aren‚Äôt exactly friendly.

To add to that, I dropped out of school earlier this year because I felt so incapable of doing well and panicked because some of my teachers hated me and I had no close, real friends. I learned about narcissism and realised narcissists were literally everywhere, I became paranoid. It was like the world turned black and I had no one to talk to who understood my point of view or knew the things I knew. I couldn‚Äôt handle it, it was like a crisis. I felt so alone and afraid. Now I‚Äôm even more worthless, no one will probably ever hire me except supermarkets if I‚Äôm lucky. No man will likely ever love me because he will be too embarrassed, because I carry a symbol of low intellect and status. I feel less than human because of it. I wish I knew before that some people evaluate the entirety of a human being on their status and accomplishments. I know those aren‚Äôt the best people, but I assume they are most people. I fear that no one will have the capacity to see beyond it, and my identity will be associated with the stereotype of ‚Äúdropout‚Äù for the rest of my life. It‚Äôs terrible and unchangeable. The shame and stigma makes me want to isolate myself forever.

It‚Äôs so rare to find people who want an intimate connection, and even if I do find them they probably won‚Äôt want to be near me because I left school early. I‚Äôm aware that my perception is probably inaccurate. I had such big dreams but they‚Äôve been crushed. Before I learned about the darker sides to humanity I was intensely optimistic. I was really confident and people would idealise me and I loved everyone so much. I felt so vibrant, but it‚Äôs a state I may never be in again. I was planning to earn a living as a musician or a writer but I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for me anymore. I also don‚Äôt like people very much, most of them are unconscious, self centred, deceptive and untrustworthy. I feel so hopeless. I‚Äôm honestly just annoyed at humans and the way society is structured. I‚Äôm also annoyed at myself for being so pathetic and sensitive. 

All in all, I refuse to fully accept that my future is a train wreck, my life has been good up until this point. If I had to accept that I would have no reason to live. I‚Äôm completely clueless when it comes to the corporeal aspects of life and physical responsibilities. I‚Äôm too afraid to lead my life, I‚Äôm literally incapable. I wish we lived in tribes or extended family households. I wish life as a human wasn‚Äôt such an intimidating, boring responsibility.

depression,"had a 5.5 cm brain tumor removed 2 summers ago at 21 y/o. I was left with pretty severe unilateral (one side) paralysis. After a lot of intense therapy I can walk again but I limp and have no fine motor control. I was born with a hypermobility disorder, so I have a natural lack of stability in my joints and dislocate easily. The combination of this and the lack of motor control causes me severe joint pain on my weak side. I have had depression since childhood. I've developed really reliable and usually healthy coping skills and I normally have an incredible and large support system. I started taking wellbutrin this spring and it was helping a lot more than I thought it would. 

I worked 10- 15 hours a week until COVID and it takes everything out of me. I applied for disability almost a year ago. It's a long process and is incredibly hard to get disability under the age of 45 in the US because you have to be able to prove that you can't 1) work enough to support yourself right now or
2) realistically learn to work enough to support yourself through school/work training.
The state I live in doesn't have a temporary disability program. And they do not help younger disabled people pay for the type of education that they would need to support themselves. I lost my job during COVID so I applied for unemployment 68 days ago. The status of my claim has been ""processed"" since the first week. I'm apparently one of the 30% of people in my state who have applied that are still waiting for their benefits. It's a big problem in my state and people are finding it literally impossible to get in contact with anyone for information. I've tried everything. for months. I don't even know if I'll be approved because I work so little and am applying for disability.

  I lately have had the hardest time getting out of bed. I feel like I'm rotting into the floor.  I've been forgetting to take my meds. I have no job. I have no money for gas to go anywhere with. Going for a long walk would be great if it wouldn't end up putting me in more pain later in the day. My insurance won't pay for an electric wheelchair. I struggle to propel a regular wheelchair because of the paralysis/weakness in my arm. I can do it, but its actually more difficult than walking. I feel trapped in my house. For context,  My IQ has always tested between 139 and 141, so very high.  Being this mentally unstimulated is hell for me.

My house is a mess. Not filthy but overwhelming and unorganized. I feel like I want to throw up or die constantly. The people I normally rely on for support have distanced themselves, not deliberately or with malicious intent, but because I have a hard time joining them in their activities, so we see less of eachother, or because they had a baby, or because they moved or got married and a new job. I'm not angry and they are all kind to me, but I can't help but feel very very left behind by life. I am in so much pain  constantly. Sometimes it's so bad that my own brain can't process that amount of pain and my ears ring and I go blank for a second. I used to just want to die or stop existing all the time. I still do. But now I really badly just want to dance again. I used to be a GREAT dancer. Wanting to die is BS but I'm used to it and I eventually will get to die. I will probably never dance in a way that's satisfying to me again.  I haven't even gotten started on how current events are affecting my mental health, but I just realized how long this is and its been somehow both cathartic and embarrassing. I had a point but I can't even remember what I was planning to ask of discuss. I guess I'm just hoping someone might have something to say that helps","Almost 2 years after brain surgery and I've never felt this hopeless, worthless and overwhelmed WARNING: lengthy sob story",tommy_no-shoes,2020-06-19 14:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc21ku/almost_2_years_after_brain_surgery_and_ive_never/,2,1.0,3,19,701

Life is difficult as is, I don't need to be reminded that I'm getting older and will eventually become too physically weak and fatigued to make something of my life.

My birthday is tomorrow and I'll be turning 30. I've been dreading this age because I thought I would have things together by then. Still stuck in a toxic job and still living with parents and still depressed, and still stuck in quarantine.  At least if sh!t were open out there, I could go take myself to the boxing gym, beat the sh!t out of a heavy bag, go to a bar on my bday, get drunk, listen to live music, then wander the streets of NYC.

Instead I'm going to be sitting home and contemplating my entire existence up to this point, which to date was a roller coaster of having been in depression for most of my life (since age 5. I vividly remember wanting to die when I was at that age), gotten out of depression for a couple months, and now back in it again.

I'm not looking forward to my birthday. What I'm really looking forward to is seeing my psychiatrist again to talk about my f*cked up brain and how we can fix it again.

(Addition) When I wasn't depressed, going to the boxing gym for 2-3 hrs daily was helping me tremendously, and it really helped being surrounded by respectful fighters who aren't going to ask you stupid frivolous questions (e.g. what are you doing for your b-day) that I find most people are apt to asking.",Not announcing my b-day tomorrow so I won't be asked 'how I am doing' by people who have no clue I'm depressed and am feeling hopeless,WineBunny,2020-06-19 16:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc3vtj/not_announcing_my_bday_tomorrow_so_i_wont_be/,2,1.0,2,26,288

I told him to never leave me and he said he wouldn‚Äôt do that.

We talked one time, face to face. I told him I don‚Äôt wanted to eat anymore and felt like it was sort of useless. He wasn‚Äôt of this advice so he came hanging out with me and two friends, which he was friends with one of them. We talked, only the both of us, all the way to the restaurant we wanted to. There was too much people so we just grabbed something at the gas station and went back walking to school. It was Halloween actually, I just remembered.

We texted for weeks, I was in love with him. I loved the way he was, the way he thought! I founded him so perfect. I guess that didn‚Äôt last. We were texting good night with hearts and fighting over who is the cutest between us. We were almost a couple. But as I said earlier, he didn‚Äôt trusted me.

I can‚Äôt fake to myself. And after he left me not saying why, my state became more horrible and I really started to be in depression. I kept asking myself if I was worth it or not, was I good enough? I guess not.

I tried and tried not doing anything, hoping he‚Äôll change, but he‚Äôs like that since I‚Äôm 7 (my parents broke up).

depression,"Im Curious if anybody else had ha a terrible time MENTALLY with comming off venlafaxine. 
I was taking 300 mg for the past two and a half years. And this year I decided that was it. I was tired of the side affects and I started to take wellbutrin which was working better for me. 

A bit of back story I wouldn't say I have a drug dependency issue... I've done loads of non pharmaceutical drugs, and although I would say for small periods of time I was addicted to coke I never let myself spiral past a year of using it. I experienced cravings but I was able to distract myself with weed. But never. I really mean never have I ever gone through withdrawal this bad.

I weaned off by reducing my dose until I was taking 37.5mg
I would open the caps and weigh out half that amount and make myself 18.75mg caps. I weaned off so slowly probably over the span of six months. Bu the last month I was taking 18.5 every two days and then  every four days and then I stopped. 

It's been 2.5 weeks since I've had my last dose. I have the pills in my medicine cabinet and I literally can not bring myself to dispose of them (hand them back to the pharmacy). I feel like I did when I would have coke in my house. It was too valuable of a high to destroy it. And even though I haven't taken any I feel like i want to crush up the balls and snort them and I fantasize about this atleast two or three times a day. 

This here is huge proof that the work ive been doing on my mental health has been lacking. Because I want to remove this crutch and stand on my own without the venlafaxine and I literally dont think I can. You know why? Cause life was more FUN when I was using it. Where as my life now.on wellbutrin is more stable and positive and sustainable. It's no HIGH. Not like effexor was. And part of me feels like I want to just take it cause the withdrawal symptoms are so rough. 

Any people here used venlafaxine and had a hard time comming off? 

I'd like to also say that I've tried to stop taking it at least 4 times and I was successful this time. It's the first.time since I started that I dont use it at all. 
And lastly any pharmaceutical drugs I've taken have been prescribed. These are juet about 30 or 40 left over pills i have that I cant part with.

depression,"Hi everyone, 

I‚Äôve been thinking about this recently and wondered whether anyone else has had the same experience. 

I experienced a period of depression about 4 years ago that had built up over the few years prior to that. The worst portion of it lasted for around 3 months, culminating in a few incidents of non-suicidal self harm. My parents noticed the cuts and spoke to me about it; at the time we talked about it a few times in highly emotional discussions but since then it has never been brought up or referenced. I don‚Äôt hold this against them as I know they didn‚Äôt know how to respond or help, and I didn‚Äôt know what kind of support I wanted either. But the fact that it‚Äôs never mentioned has meant that this time in my life is kind of a black mark in my memory that no one knows about or understands. Sort of like the ‚Äòelephant in the room‚Äô of the memory storage zone of my brain. Moreover, while my parents know about my self-harm, they don‚Äôt understand what the solo recovery process I‚Äôve had to get on with has been like. I don‚Äôt really feel I can talk to them about something like this, we‚Äôre just not that kind of family.

I ultimately managed to recover from my period of depression. I am now happy to say that I am an extremely happy, confident and easygoing person. I‚Äôm now seen as the ‚Äòchilled, funny friend‚Äò that rarely panics about anything (as well as being everyone‚Äôs unpaid shrink).

However, no one knows about the dark times I went through before this, or the fact that the reason I am this type of person now is because I know what unhappiness is like and therefore always try to support people and bring joy into people‚Äôs lives. My friends did not notice my depression at the time (or if they did they didn‚Äôt bring it up, and neither did I) and it doesn‚Äôt feel right to tell them after all this time, because although I don‚Äôt hold it against them that they weren‚Äôt aware of it (I did a fab job of covering it up), I know they‚Äôd feel awful if they found out that I was once going through something like that and A) they didn‚Äôt know and B) I didn‚Äôt feel I could tell them for whatever reason. 

Almost all of the time, I am genuinely happy. However I‚Äôve noticed that when I‚Äôm alone or at night, I think a lot about those dark times that shaped me so much. For a long time, I wasn‚Äôt bothered by thinking about it so much as I knew it was something I needed to process and I knew blocking it out could lead to problems further down the line. But as 4 years have now passed, I‚Äôm getting to the point where I really just want to move on now and stop thinking about it so much. 

I understand it was a formative experience in my life and I‚Äôm not trying to forget the past, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep dwelling on it forever. Online articles and blogs tell me I need to ‚Äòfind closure‚Äô, but I‚Äôm not really sure how to ‚Äòfind closure‚Äô or what that really means for me. I‚Äôve made an effort to find closure, by slowly reintroducing myself to some of the things I cut out of my life when I began my healing process, such as fiction novels, social media, and certain genres of music. During my difficult times, these were things I used as escapism rather than dealing with my problems, and so I now have negative associations with them and used to worry that if I was exposed to these things again, it would trigger old wounds to reopen. Sometimes reintroducing myself to them is hard, but overall the fact that the ceiling doesn‚Äôt suddenly cave in when I expose myself to them is encouraging and makes me realise I‚Äôm more emotionally resilient than I might think. 

However, I don‚Äôt feel that doing all these things has really contributed as much as I want to taking me further to ‚Äòmoving on‚Äô. 

What I‚Äôd like your opinions on is: Am I being unrealistic in thinking I should be able to move on after ‚Äòonly‚Äô 4 years, or is it bad news that I‚Äôm still thinking about it quite a lot? What else can I do to help myself move on and find closure from my past depression and self harm? Or are they memories which will forever kind of haunt me, and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll have to learn to accept?

Thanks very much in advance. Any support or advice is wholeheartedly appreciated.",Moving on from the difficult memories of past depression,kittylove-00,2020-06-19 14:47:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hc1zid/moving_on_from_the_difficult_memories_of_past/,0,1.0,2,9,787

depression,"Hey guys, thanks for reading this and your time

I've been dealing with a hideous descent into depression. I get these from time to time, but usually, they get triggered by events in my life. I've been suffering from depression waves since my teenage years, but they have become more apparent around my 19th year. I'm 23 now and they have become awful. I noticed that slowly, things wouldn't be fun for me anymore. Drawing, going out, playing video games, talking to people I like. These things would often give me a reaction in my brain and my brain would make dopamines whenever I did them. Slowly, they just stopped doing this to me (over the course of years). Now I either feel absolutely nothing or just plain miserable whatever I'm doing. They become the worst when I'm doing nothing or not talking to anyone, I need to constantly interact with someone to keep my brain busy, and even then I have the occasional slip-ups of negative thoughts in my brain that would snowball into me having graphic clips playing in my head where I'm either self-harming or killing myself.

The problem I am dealing with now is that I feel absolutely no enjoyment from eating. I have not eaten anything in almost 3 days or a little more. I have not gotten out of bed to cook anything (despite doing groceries) it's just not fun to me anymore. It feels like a chore when I have to put food in my mouth and eat it. I don't feel good when I eat anymore, and because of this I just haven't done anything regarding food. I used to enjoy going for big bowls of Ramen, sushi, takoyaki, and all that stuff but now I just don't care anymore and I don't want to eat anything at all. I tried to eat yesterday, I finally made a grilled cheese at around 11 pm after which I drank water and my body just literally rejected it and I ended up throwing it all up.

Right now all I eat in a day is 1 cup of coffee with oat milk, some crackers, and that's all. I usually love cooking and doing things in the kitchen, and I used to get very excited about food. But now I just feel nothing towards it.

This is terrifying to me. I'm not having fun anymore, and now it has extended to eating. My body is starving itself and I feel like I can't force my brain to eat. If I do force myself, it just feels miserable to me and I throw away my food after a few bites. I don't know what to do. My therapist says I'm depressed and yes, I believe that, but I have heard stories before of people starving to death due to depression and I'm terrified this is going to happen to me. I really value my body a lot too and I don't want to get very thin. I've now lost 5 KG in a week and even my mother notices I lost too much weight too quickly. I don't know what to do or how to get myself to eat anymore.

There is a constant hole in my stomach and it sometimes hurts, but I can't get myself to eat or feel like I /want/ to eat.

I know people will say ""just eat bro"" but it's not that easy. It's not enjoyable. Even if I force myself, it just tastes weird and gross in my mouth and I actually feel full after a few bites. What should I be doing? What's going on with me and why is my brain doing this to me? I just want to eat again.

Thanks for reading.

I guess it's only right that karma was next
And I'ma be open and honest with you, your absence is causing the stress
I wish the pain I feel would lay inside a coffin and rest
And it's only you who can soften my flesh
But still you run me in circles and lately you ain't been responding to texts
And now my only option is to act like I don't fucking need you
I bottle up the pain although the bottle's fucking see-through
I pray to God and wish that we could wash it up and re-do
Guess every love story just ain't got a fucking sequel
I just need to know if you feel the same

if you know me, you should know how i truly felt about you. if you don't know how i felt about you, than take a step back and think about why that is.


I'm sorry mom, dad, grandma. I'm sorry i wasn't enough, no matter how hard i always tried. whether sports, academics, or just personality: it was never to your liking. it was never enough. i was never enough, no matter what you think, i can tell that's how you've always felt. there's so much that happened while growing up that I'm sorry for, but the worst of them all is this moment. in this moment, this is the one thing I'll never be able to truly apologize for. 


i regret not taking another handful of pills last time i tried. i regret the night the gun jammed and i sat screaming, wishing I could just get out. i regret not being ejected from the seat when that car pulled out in front of me. all these moments spent cheating death, but I've always known it'd be by my hands. the times when i was told i should've been dead, or that it's okay because it was meant to be. ""it wasn't your time."" and ""you have so much to live for"". it was never any of these things, it was because i fucked up again and again. such a simple task I've always failed at. just another one added to the list i guess.

depression,"I've dealt with depression for over 20 years by now but it feels like it's getting worse and worse. I'm not just depressed anymore, I'm actively scared. Scared of everything, nothing, what could happen, what might happen. I've seen dozens of therapists over the years and not a single one has really helped. I've been on meds and it didn't help. The people I could actually talk to don't understand it at all. They don't get how much energy it takes to function on a basic level. They don't get that it quickly gets overwhelming on a daily basis.

The only think keeping me from being suicidal is my kids, it's not fair to screw them up like I am. But at the same time after my divorce my role in their lives is so small its just another source of depression. I hardly smile anymore, much less laugh. The brave face I put on daily is wearing thin. I have no support in this. Basically, my family just wants me to see a shrink and get back on meds.

There's just so much crap in every direction I look, I don't see a reason to even try to get better. It's pointless.

I haven't even mentioned the anger. If I'm not scared, I'm angry. Really angry. Angry at everything and nothing. For the most part I control it. But almost daily something happens to really set me off. I don't let it out. Ever. I can't. If I did it would make any situation worse and that would make my depression worse. So I keep the vast majority of it in and that makes my depression worse too.

depression,"folks on this sub (and other similar subs, where I'll be crossposting) have been really kind and helpful, which I appreciate so much. I wanted to share my experience just in case it's useful to someone else.

without getting into too much detail, I was planning to kill myself on Monday morning. but instead, I went to my local crisis center, which is free and available to anyone in the community having a mental health crisis or drug/alcohol problems.

I didn't know what to expect when I got there and was pretty nervous. but it wasn't scary at all. just kind of strange, because I'd never been somewhere like that before.

when I arrived, a security guard did a COVID-19 screening (asked if I had symptoms or had been in contact with anyone who had it, etc). then he had me empty my pockets and did a scan like they do at the airport, to make sure I didn't have any weapons or anything. he looked in my purse and said he'd need to keep it (I had headphones and chargers in there and no wires are allowed in the building, etc), but I was allowed to keep my phone.

I filled out some simple paperwork. then I saw a nurse, who took my blood pressure and asked about my medical history, as well as what had brought me in today. I explained to him that I was suicidal, gave him a basic rundown of what's happening in my life and told him what my suicide plan was when he asked.

then I waited a little while longer and finally saw a counselor.

we talked for about an hour. he was really kind and I didn't feel embarrassed or ashamed while talking to him, which surprised me. he told me he doesn't think I have depression, which was confusing tbh. but I'm not a counselor, so what do I know?

initially, he suggested that I go to the hospital for a few days, but I was hesitant, because I can't take a lot of time off work and I was concerned about how much that would cost. I said I would need more info about that process before deciding, but we didn't discuss it beyond that.

ultimately there's only so much that he could do for me in an hour. he helped me write up a basic plan for when I'm feeling suicidal (who I could call, that kind of thing) and wrote down a website where I could search for a therapist (which I'd already gotten from the person I talked to through Lifeline Chat, so it wasn't new info to me). that was it.

he arranged a time to call me the next day and check in (to make sure I hadn't killed myself, I guess), but said that if I didn't pick up the phone, he wouldn't be concerned.

that was... weirdly disappointing, in a way I wouldn't have expected. it felt almost like, because I'm ""well"" enough to hold down a job and take care of my responsibilities, he didn't see my situation as particularly urgent and he figured I'd be fine, even though he'd said I should consider hospitalization an hour before and I'd confirmed to him that I still wanted to die.

like, I could be wrong. I'm not an expert, obviously, and I'm not a mind reader. that's just how it felt to me.

after that, I went home.

he called on Tuesday, at the time he said he would, and confirmed that he'd call again at the same time on Wednesday for one last check-in. but nobody ever called. which was honestly upsetting to me, because I'd had two really hard nights and was having suicidal thoughts again, so I was kind of counting on that call. I know I shouldn't complain about a free service. it was just disappointing.

I'm still suicidal and feeling low and overwhelmed. it's been a hard week. going to the crisis center didn't change much for me, not that I expected it to. going there did keep me from killing myself this week, though, so I'd recommend it for that alone, even though I still don't really want to be here.

so if you've ever wondered what happens when you go to the crisis center... that's what it was like for me, and I imagine it's probably similar at most places. your mileage may vary.

honestly, my biggest regret is not agreeing to go the hospital when the counselor initially brought it up. I think I should've gone. maybe they could've helped me there. I'll never know for su re.

I remember sitting in the crisis center, thinking ""if I don't go to the hospital and get treatment now, I never will,"" and I still feel that way. I don't think I'll seek further treatment. I know myself well enough to know that. I missed my window, like I always do.

please don't make the same mistake I did. I know hospitalization isn't a magical solution and isn't the best option for everyone... but if you have the opportunity to get treatment, please try.",went to the crisis center,clydesland,2020-06-19 06:40:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbvref/went_to_the_crisis_center/,2,1.0,9,5,840

I was always thinking about something weather it was girls, money, work, raves something was always on my mind.

my mum used to say to me i was always ""carried by the wind""

when lockdown started it was good for a bit but then I started deteriorating, I stopped doing basic things like brushing my teeth, showering, eating (lost so much muscle mass its mad) and the worst days which were many at one pointi couldnt get out of bed and intrusive thoughts made me have a mental breakdown which broke me. 

after the breakdown i noticed something. my head was very clear, there wernt many intrusive thoughts and when they came by i didnt really give a shit. on the other hand i didnt have many good thoughts either. my brain felt quiet compared to what it was before. I think im at peace but i dont know

socialising now feels like a chore almost but i dont really feel sad, i just cant be bothered to talk to anyone. I think i feel anxious socialising now and in general.

Pretending i‚Äôm okay and remaining quiet.

Wondering why I even try

When everything always goes awry

&amp;#x200B;

Although to others I seem happy and complete

I am constantly drowning in a feeling of defeat

Unable to find a reason to live

I‚Äôve finally ran out of cares to give

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a house who‚Äôs family left on vacation

I appear to be full and active yet I‚Äôm trapped in stagnation

Left behind with only the protection of a measly garden gnome

depression,"I wasted it being an observer. I would envy the teenagers that had friends. Always wanted to have friends to do cool and youthful stuff with. Every attempt at friendship has failed.

My youth is gone and I have no memories to show for it other than pain and envy. I guess I can't say I didnt try.

I try to cope by locking myself in my own little world where nobody has friends but every once in a while media reminds me of the fact there are people actually experiencing this. And it sends me into an envy spiral. I don't think I can ever escape this. I will always be envious of the fact people experience this and it will always send me down a spiral of hell.

I'm not even suicidal but this hell won't end until I'm dead... or until a time machine is invented and I can go back and re-live all the stuff I never got to experice. Young adult love. Young adult fun. Social circles and situations. Actually feeling like you're a part of something.

depression,"So next month i'm gonna be 14, i have been always kinda depressed but i don't talk to anyone about it. When i was 8 or something like that my parents started to argue a lot and at one point it got physical and my dad went to jail for about 10 months. They got divorced, but my dad was still a big problem for us. We all thought that he was sick, like mentally because things that he put my mom, brother, sister and me through are terrible. I remember once that he got drunk and we all locked ourselves in my and my brothers room and waited for my dad to calm down. I also remember that so many times he would grab a knife in front all of us and say he was gonna slit his throat. 2 weeks ago was the 2 year anniversary of his death. We are all doing better. We moved to a place 2 miles away. Even after 2 years of my dads death i haven't told anyone about it. I sleep 3 hours everyday and just listen to music. I love games but we're not doing so good financially so i can't play games to ease my mind. I have trauma from everything that happened and it's really hard for me. This is the first time i'm talking to someone about this. And for everyone dealing with deppresion, just keep pushing through, it'll get better, at least that's everyone says to me.

depression,"I have been dreading this moment for months. Every cell in my body, if given the choice, would not have gone. Graduation took all of the pain I'd been hiding from and threw it in my face. Everything I hated about my life united to meet me at graduation. But I put on my best face for my family. All for the same family that crushed me.

After the ceremony I collapsed in my room from exhaustion. I don't remember how long I was asleep. But I do remember the anger and sadness I felt when I woke up again to knocking at my door. Great. More acting, more smiling. I put on a real good show. I even made calls and said thank you to all the strangers who I happened to be related to for their well wishes. I know it was convincing because no one stopped me from hiding back in my room afterwards.

And then I got a couple of messages. I made the mistake of answering them. It was depressing to say the least. I cut one of them out of my life on a whim. It was dramatic, and I could finally say how hurt I felt about \*something\*, at least. I feel empty now though. Well, I felt empty before, but now I think I could describe it as hollowing. I don't know how to process anything that I am dealing with. I don't know where to start or where it ends. I feel like I am creating more problems for myself to cover up the old ones.

When I remember how I got here, I just feel overwhelming despair. How does anyone expect me to try and feel happy or to do my best? How do they expect me to have hope? Why do I have to bear that weight? I can't do it. My grandfather told me earlier to, ""Keep doing what you're doing since it is clearly working,"" and my heart sank. Yeah... it's totally working.

Honestly, I don't know anymore and everything feels so empty. I'm not depressed but I'm nowhere close to being happy again. I don't think I have made a happy memory in years. Honestly, what's the point living this way if you have nothing that makes you happy anymore.

I have a loving family and a boyfriend who loves me more than I could ever wish for. I have money saved and am in a good position in life.

depression," I have been unhappy for years. I am 21 years old and I finished my only year of study in an environment that I don't even like. I have feelings that I do not understand, for example I know that I feel joy at times but it is empty inside. The few friends I have are only there when something goes wrong in their lives and they need advice or there is an interesting drama in my life and they can have the right one role. I was in the hospital but once there I was unable to express my discomfort so I just stayed for my suicidal urge.

 I no longer have the courage to commit suicide, and therefore I am only suffering but it is unbearable. I'm just changing behaviors to suit everyone, because I know they don't like the real me but the me they want. I did everything to be loved, I even made up lies that nobody discovered all that to be loved, or I influenced relationships to be able to be in the center, and I know it was bad but I just wanted to be loved and to be helped. Today I dreamed of my first true love of 3 years ago and once again I wake up with this loneliness, which prevents me from acting because I tell myself what good is it ?

 I have always lived for others, and I know that I am unable to live for others because what I want is to be loved. I have attempted suicide since I was 14 and I have been able to express my discomfort to everyone around me at least once, but everyone does not care as long as they are happy. For example my best friend was depressed for several years, I supported him, helped him face harassment etc. Today he has a quiet life with his girlfriend and he only calls me when he is bored.

depression,"Just incase, don't worry, im not suicidal, not yet anyways.

My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and I need to do like 22 packets if I wanna graduate.",My life has been a mess for years and I don't know what to do anymore.,scor6879,2020-06-19 06:47:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbvu4y/my_life_has_been_a_mess_for_years_and_i_dont_know/,2,0.86,5,16,1140

depression,"I feel very guilty. The world is growing and changing without me. This makes me feel overwhelmed. I wasted all my time. My supposed best years are gone and days keep going on with little to show. Everytime I see someone that I know, they look a little older. And I can't stop it, life just goes on. I was struggling years ago when I was a teen; I was always looking for something, even then, some sort of salvation or relief, but now life is just too far gone for me. Its been so long. And all I can do is sleep and waste the days. Wasting time on my phone, distracting myself until I get to sleep again. I can't come to grips with the reality that everyone is growing and I am no longer a child; even though I still feel like one. I'm trapped in a time that no longer exists.
This is a rare moment of expression, usually I'm too numb to care about most things. 
I can't bare the responsibility of having to work. I can't dedicate myself day in and day out, waking up early, just to work for some faceless company whose values and tasks I really care little about. Is this my destiny? Is this life? I don't know how people do it. I've worked jobs before where it was a struggle to wake up and go in everyday, but I did it, rarely missing a beat, and instead of recognizing my strength and willpower just to get my ass down to that miserable office, I was fired. I know my attitude is not helping me, but believe me, I've tried being good all my life, tried giving myself to others, tried to be kind, be a good friend, listen to others speak, be a good and loyal employee, but in the end it just blows up in my face. I'm deeply afraid of my future. I can't bare the thought of having to work anymore. I just want no part of it. I can't handle any of that shit anymore. I can't handle pretending. Most of my life I've been unknown. I struggle to express myself. All the people I cared about, didn't reciprocate, and the funny thing is, I still yearn for them. Day in and day out. Its one of my distractions. 
Its 7am here, lying in bed, having a rare moment of clarity, but I'll probably be back to my numb old self by later today. Just wanted to express myself. Maybe someone will read it. I don't know.

depression,"The thoughts are back again and I don't know what to do.

I get urges to act on them and I just sit there in the corner of my room crying my eyes out because I honestly don't know what to do with myself, I wanna act on them but I just feel it would hurt my mum too much, she was talking to me about how she was sad and cried a lot when my brother left for uni and she told me she wouldn't know what she'd do if I wasn't here with her.

I sleep a lot to avoid the thoughts and everything when I can, but I know I can't do that as often because I have schoolwork to catch up on and that's just adding on to the stress, seeing how much work is overdue just frustrates me because I know I'm failing myself.

My sleeping patterns vary from time to time, sometimes I can't sleep at all and I'll stay awake days on end and then other times I just sleep so much for days.

When I'm asleep everything is gone, I don't need to worry about anything and everything just becomes so peaceful.

I just feel, what's the point in doing anything if I'm probably gonna end up dead in a couple years?

I feel like no one really gives a shit anymore and when I think about it, I don't have as many friends as I think I do. Of course you make friends and may fall out with them, cause that's just what happens but everyone around me has that one friend that they hang out with everyday, talk to everyday and can rely on.I have no best friend and I am no one's best friend.

I don't really have any future plans, I don't know why I do the things I do.I have a few things I kind of enjoy, like piano and guitar, but they're becoming so exhausting to me now and I keep thinking, what's the point in doing any of that when there are people out there who are so much better than me at those things plus anyone could learn to do those things, doing it doesn't make me talented or special.

I just feel so useless and worthless to everyone, I feel no one really wants me around and they just put up with me cause they're afraid of telling me the truth, and I don't blame them tbh, I don't really like myself either. I'm literally everything I hate.

I make 0 difference to anyone's life, there would be no changes in their lives if I was gone.

depression,"Finally got a girl to give me a chance again, was riding a high for a year.

But as it always does, the depression came back, I started getting lazy, started getting boring. She started to feel like I wasn't putting in the effort anymore.

I seriously tried, I tried so fucking hard believe me. But other than small little gestures, I couldn't muster up the energy most days to get out of bed, let alone show her how much I appreciated her.

And she got tired of it, she got tired of me always apologizing, always having to backtrack my words, always feeling like she's the only one putting any effort into the relationship.

She literally became my best friend, for the first time in years I felt like I had someone who understood me, someone I knew I needed in my life, someone who I felt I could look up to and finally pull myself out of this.

We're still friends, but I can't do it anymore. It hurts. It hurts knowing I fucked up again, it hurts knowing I gave up the only good thing I had in my life. It hurts looking at her and knowing I let her see me at my worst, that I let her down, that I lost her.

I'm fucking tired of it all. I try so hard, I give it my all everytime, but there's always something missing. There's always a cloud hanging above my head that stops me from really showing people how much I care about them.

I'm so tired of trying over and over again and letting everyone down. 

I just want it to end. I have a little bit of money saved up, I'm going to move out soon. My parents think I'm going into my second year of university, but they don't know that I got kicked out.

I'm going to live it up for however long my cash lasts, I'm going to ride a high, and when it's done, when I have nothing else left, by the end of this year. I'm going to end it.

I wrote letters to everyone in my family, to my roommates, to her, I want them to know that none of what happens is their fault. This is just me giving up, again, this is just me not being able to live like this until death takes me.

I can't tell if depression won, or if by the end of this I'll finally have peace knowing I don't have to suffer anymore.

So I've been best friends with this dude christian for about 2 and a half years now and we were as tight as 2 straight guys could be. We've told eachother everything over the years and hes like a legit brother to me. He kept me sane when I was going through some really dark moments. When I all I did was look in the mirror and hate myself and everything about me. he kept me up and made me feel like I was worth something. 

But aside from all that he was the first person to introduce me to weed at about 18 and that was all we did. It became our thing we'd meet eachother at like 11:30 at night go to this dugout at the baseball field and just get stoned out of our minds play music and just vibe out. We've had so many adventures and near death situations I cant even count. One time we decided to do doordash together and I was getting on the highway at about 40 mph (way too fast) and we spun out hit the grass and did a full 360. If a car was behind us we'd probably be dead. But there was never a dull moment like we would just be laughing joking about anything and everything we were so freakin close. And not only that but we would never argue with eachother like most close friends if there was ever a misunderstanding we talked it out right then and there and most of the time things that would cause friends to drift apart for a while would take us a matter of 30 seconds to solve because we were so dead honest about everything. He is family to me and I'd take a bullet for him.

 You get the picture. Let's skip to the present.

depression,"First time poster, struggling a bit since this pandemic. A little context about me for everyone. I‚Äôm really sorry for the length of my post as I‚Äôm on mobile. 

My dad passed away about a year and a half ago out of nowhere. We were all so surprised. It was the perfect opportunity for my family to decide I cannot be apart of them anymore because I chose to not be religious. I was forced to be my entire life and as soon as I was an adult and could think for myself, I was done with it. My family unfortunately doesn‚Äôt believe in that and completely kicked me to the curb after my dads passing. I haven‚Äôt had complete closure yet so I feel a lot of my depression stems from this. 

Since his passing, I‚Äôve moved from my home country (spouse visa). I was struggling to fit in, in my new country and then the pandemic hit. I feel like I‚Äôm so lost here. I can‚Äôt drive (nobody will insure me because of nationality and age), I obviously can‚Äôt get a job so my husband is paying for everything, I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I just feel so unwanted here. And I feel incredibly lonely. 

I‚Äôm struggling so much with my depression for the past 2 or so months. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression from a young age and it‚Äôs never seemed to quite leave. It‚Äôs always weighing on me in the back of my mind. 

I just feel so misunderstood by a lot of people in my life. People that haven‚Äôt gone through trauma, people that haven‚Äôt had depression, I just feel they really can‚Äôt relate to me. I feel like my sadness and hopelessness is weighing on my husband. I know he loves me so deeply but I worry that he feels he didn‚Äôt sign up for this. Nobody wants a wife who cries so much, feels so awful constantly, doesn‚Äôt care to have sex as much as him. He wants that happy, not a care in the world, girl he met so many years ago. I‚Äôve just been through a lot since we met and as much as I want to, I can‚Äôt be that woman for him right now. 

I want to be able to just settle down in this country but I feel so uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt even talk without someone staring which just leads me to worry, then spiral, as I‚Äôm sure some of you know how that goes. I‚Äôm not working, I hardly have any friends. The thing I used to look forward to the most was going to have my nails done because at least someone would talk to me. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for here by posting. I don‚Äôt know if I even want advice. But damn it feels good to just tell someone. Anyone. I feel so lonely here. I wish my depression would stop. I hope my husband doesn‚Äôt push me away because of it. I just feel sad today and want to talk to someone that won‚Äôt judge me or ‚Äútry and fix me‚Äù the entire time.

When do i carry the stigma depression and when is it okay to randomly feel bad and be unable to do anything?
I always thought it was normal, when i started thinking about it as ""it might not be normal"" things got worse, but i am not sure if i can go back the road by just accepting a big sad from time to time.
Some say just eating healthy doing workouts socialising and setting a goal helps and it does, for two weeks and there we go again straying further from the silver lining, away from the path i want to go.

Then I became pissed because I am literally in tears in my bed and he is saying stuff like this, it hurts. I just needed help and since he is the only one I am comfortable with, I came to him.   
I finally fell asleep and woke up 6hours later, stealing xanax that he is keeping so I don't overdose, but he noticed it and took them. He is still pissed at me and isn't asking how I am doing and just not interested at all. It hurts.

I miss it. I miss the structure. It‚Äôs the one place I feel like I can actually get better.

My mental health has been getting worse and worse everyday. I keep having really intrusive thoughts that are similar to the likes of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do x then y will happen‚Äù or something where I‚Äôll think abt doing something and if I don‚Äôt do it I‚Äôll think abt it for hours.

Thinking like this is ruining my life. I stopped taking my antidepressants (they weren‚Äôt helping at all anyway) and my GERD meds (which I need to be on bc I have really bad GERD) because one night I thought to myself ‚Äúif you ever take these again you will v*mit‚Äù (I have emetophobia).

I have 3 therapists atm. 2 in home and 1 out patient. They all suggest I might have OCD as a lot of my family has it and I match the symtoms. I‚Äôve been avoiding my psych though bc I‚Äôm afraid of talking to her after skipping my meds for months.

I have a virtual ap with her on the 25th.

depression,"I mean. Im tierd of people not getting what this is. Most people confuse Aphaty with depression. But let me tell you how I see it with my own eyes. Im not here looking for help. Im here to help others if I can.

Depression is like,feeling that you don't belong anywhere. Like... You go to school,you wake up,and you don't wanna go. And it is not because you're getting bullied,or because you can do something more fun than school. It is because in school,you don't feel like you belong there. You feel miserable. But you're strong,so you tell yourself ""i can go through with it,after school things will get better once I graduate"" You go to college or work but you don't feel like you belong there as well. One day you quit your job or you get fired or whatever. And then you're like ""now what?"" like ""I couldn't find my place anywhere. And I just feel empty."" . So now i gotta find myself a job. Well I don't want to go to work. So my choice rn is to either starve to death now. Or work,and die miserable because i didn't do what I wanted to do. That's what it feels like. Like you just don't want to live in a world like this. Like it is just not your place. You don't belong anywhere.  Thats why many depressed people think about suicide. They just want to find a place where they belong. For example: You got some money and you go ahead and buy yourself a new car. You get a Ford. But that Ford just doesn't suit you. You don't like it. So what do you do? You return it and you get a different car. But what if that's life we are talking about,and not a car? Depression is like war. You either win or you die trying. The thing to fight it is to find a place where you belong. And something to fight for. And if you can't well. I won't tell you to kill yourself. But I won't tell you not to. That's something that you decide. And many people might say ""you didn't give your own life,you don't have the right to take it"" . Well... when was the last time you suffered like this to fucking tell me what I have the right to do or not. Or ""Killing yourself is selfish"" It's selfish? Then when was the last time you did something for me? Something that will make me feel better? It is really easy to say shit like this. When you don't know the feeling of being in a crowd and feeling alone. Or to just not find your place. Somewhere you feel like home. So no I don't feel ugly,worthless etc. I feel empty. And no I don't want someone to fucking come and hug me,or kiss me or tell me that it is going to be okay. I just want to find my place. I just want to fill that emptyness and feel happy again. So if you know someone with depression. Don't tell him that it is going to be okay,because he/she heard it like a 1000 times. Just make sure that he/she knows that there is someone for him/her. And if you have depression. Then fight with fangs and claws because let me tell you something. You survived where many people putted a gun in their mouth and pulled the trigger. And that makes you strong. So fight with it.",What depression feels like.,KingEnenra,2020-06-19 02:14:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbs4qo/what_depression_feels_like/,0,0.79,5,4,588

Honestly, I cannot imagine living, growing older, getting a job, starting a family. I know it's too late. I've wasted my teenage years pursuing something I considered valuable. Now I see, it never was. I'm alone, without friends or family.
What's left? Suicide? If only I were strong enough to commit. I've often fantasized, planned, simulated. But I always snap out of it and get distracted. I don't want to be distracted. I don't want to pretend anymore. I've begged so many people for help. Any help. Nobody responded. Well, it's over. Or at least it will, if I won't get any help soon. 

Why is life considered something positive? It's just pain. Neverending pain. But it's the uncertainty that keeps bringing me closer to ending it all. I'll never know what my life could be if I lived it slightly differently. Only one thing is certain. My existence is insignificant. Nobody will miss me, since nobody cares about me anyway. Sure, there will be crying, condolences. But only for a day, to keep up good appearences. That's all that mourning is.

Honestly, I'm not convinced suicide is the best way out. I mean, I've tried once. But I didn't let anybody notice. Was I scared? Embarrassed?

Haha... It's that foolish hope again. But there's got to be a reason not everybody dies of suicide. I just don't know what to do. Nobody notices me. Nobody helps me. I'm alone. If I won't get help immediately I'll truly lose any possibilities for a decent life.

I feel like I should only talk to him happy and whatnot because I want to keep him happy, same goes with the other people I talk to I can talk to them as friends but can't randomly message and be like hey I feel like shit again, and I feel this is just from "" the thoughts you have when you're sad "" that you normally wouldn't think or feel otherwise. such as the only people who I could I ended up messing up our friendship and now they've left me.

depression,"Earlier today, girlfriend \[22\] of 2 years broke up with me \[26\]. We were really good and honestly came off like two peas in a pod. Well last week, I started having this weird feeling about something. Instincts and gut were screaming that something was wrong. I didn't push it or bring it up often, but I had that constant nudge. We lived together and no issues then bam, suddenly it becomes distant. I ask her if everything's okay and she reassures me that it is when I do. Well, today, I brought her to work and brought her some lunch to her job and she breaks it to me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore.  No cues or anything, just sorry bye. She got her stuff and left the apartment after work.

depression,"hi reddit. so. time i told someone this.

&amp;#x200B;

two years ago, because i did something really, really stupid, i missed out on a scholarship. a pretty big one. kinda huge. id been working towards it all my life, and then, because i was 17 and stupid, missed out. i was told later that i was guaranteed to have gotten it. it felt like a gut punch.

&amp;#x200B;

i just started my second year in college. im lucky, my parents pay my tuition, though its not easy for them. i know how lucky i am. truly. but i cant get that failure out of my mind. im consumed with regret, and guilt, and shame. i hate myself, and sometimes wake up genuinely believing i cant go on because of how worthless i feel. i keep thinking about the money, and feel like i want to throw up. i constantly compare myself with those who did get the scholarship, and feel like a spoilt, unworthy freeloader. my self esteem is basically non-existent. i think about killing myself all the time, but just cant do it- i like uni, i like being me, i like being alive. at least when im not thinking about that. it just hurts, so much. im sorry if these dont sound like real or rational problems, but goddamn it hurts. 

i did pretty ok my first year, good grades, threw myself into work and uni life so i wouldnt have to stop and think about all of this. it went by in one exhausting flash. but my first semester in second year was spent in total isolation due to covid. basically just me, in a strange city, alone in a room, unemployed due to layoffs, with nothing to do but study and obsess. i had a total breakdown. i kept bursting into tears and feeling so empty inside id just sit on my bed for hours staring into space, lost in the past, thinking about all the things i hoped to add to my cv to ease that feeling to guilt this term and feeling like nothing could ever give me hope again. i came very close to hurting myself.

depression,"i‚Äôm 15 years old and i‚Äôve struggled w depression anxiety and sexual frustration for ever. recently something happened that made me lowkey happy for the first time in a long time. i got invited to the mall by a girl i met online. before you call me stupid,  i knew that this girl was real and not a catfish and she was cute, she thought i was cute too. like i said she invited me to the mall and while we were there we had fun and flirted a lot. i was pretty happy. then she saw these dudes and went up to them and asked for their socials. she then started to flirt with them and somehow ended seeing some kids cock. wow. stupid me, i stayed w her and still flirted. she saw another group of dudes and got their snaps. at the end of the day, whatever i got a hug and that was all. fine. that hurt tho, if i‚Äôm being honest.

i‚Äôve been off my meds for a year a half now (i think) and honestly i wish i still had them. not for the purpose of taking them because i‚Äôd flush them down the toilet anyway because all they did to me was make me sleepy and gain weight, don‚Äôt know if it actually made me feel better. i want them so i can have a capsule of pills ready to OD on. now i have to actually research what pills actually work so i can die successfully lolllll. do i need to be like rediagnosed or something? 

nothing gives me enjoyment like it used to when i was younger. maybe it‚Äôs my fault that i don‚Äôt go out, but when i do, i still come home to the same gut feeling of wanting to die. i still hate myself. still cry myself to sleep. and then i lock myself in my room and play video games, watch shows, or scroll through social media that increases my hatred of living until i come out occasionally to binge eat unhealthily. i have texts either left on delivered or read because i‚Äôve never felt a real connection in such a long time. everyone‚Äôs just a big blurb in my life and it‚Äôs hard being a people pleaser. i‚Äôm dissociating from everyone, including my friends and family. especially thanks to quarantine! it‚Äôs bad, but i‚Äôm just..comfortable this way, you know what i mean? 

there‚Äôs absolutely NO drive in my life. nothing exciting that i‚Äôm looking forward to. no relationships to keep me going. no motivation to move and keep going.

my therapist probably is disappointed in me, not a new feeling though. i hate that i‚Äôm so selfish that there‚Äôs other people suffering too with way more worse reasons like they‚Äôre literally homeless, which makes me even more depressed. like wow i am really just that fucking stupid. there‚Äôs just nothing to strive for. the clubs i‚Äôm in? no enjoyment anymore. the times i hang out with my friends? no enjoyment anymore. the video games? the relationships? the laughter, smiles? no real enjoyment. i‚Äôm living in an empty shell of a girl who used to enjoy, well, living. there‚Äôs no one i can really express to anymore that won‚Äôt treat me differently.

Some days it just comes out how sad I am and how I‚Äôve contemplated suicide. The urge has grown stronger and stronger. Because people just keep using me. 

My roommates don‚Äôt pay utilities and always have an excuse. All bills ar win my name so unless I want it to go to collection under my name, unless I want my credit hit, unless I want to be without electricity and water and even the phones are all on one plan under me.

This is the man that dumped me for finding out he was cheating. This is the man that robbed me of thousands because he didn‚Äôt want to return items after the breakup that I left at his house. This is the man who he and his mother lied and manipulated me into aborting our child because ‚Äúhe was on medication for his chronic illness‚Äù but turns out the meds would have done nothing and I aborted out of fear because they kept lying to me. 

I decided to be his friend because I figured he did all those horrible things because he had recently been diagnosed with cancer. 

I decided to be a better person and just be his firmed and be there for him during his own tough times. 

And when I came to him today, telling him I wanted to quit, that my friends always use me and no one cares. That I was just exhausted from living, 

He told me ‚Äúyou need to take some antidepressants, and find some help. This is and everyday thing for you and it‚Äôs come to a point where I know it‚Äôs fake and you do it for attention‚Äù

depression,"I'm worried that I wont ever find a medication that helps my depression, anxiety and OCD. This is going to be really long-winded, sorry.

Here is a little backstory, I guess. I should mention that 4 years before I was actually diagnosed with depression I had started abusing prescription painkillers that ultimately turned in to a 10 year struggle with addiction. I have been clean from illicit drugs (heroin and cocaine was what I was doing before I quit) for almost 5 years, but I am still in a drug treatment program. So keep in mind I was also abusing drugs during this time.

Anyway, I'm 28. I was formally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD after I graduated in 2010, after my two best friends were both killed in a car accident. I took Lexapro and klonopin for many many years with no real side effects but I never felt that it helped, I just didn't care enough about myself to try other things. I quit taking Lexapro at some point, and didn't take any kind of anti depressant for a long time, up until 2015 when I started going to a new doctor. I took Wellbutrin for a while, got up to 300mg but didn't think it was helping, so I quit taking it after 4 or 5 months.

Fast forward to this year, I started going to a new doctor and she prescribed me whatever the generic version of Lexapro is. I took it one time. I had THE WORST reaction to it. It was the worst panic attack I have ever had combined with a weird metallic taste in my mouth and I would get waves of this weird ""cold"" discomfort and then I would get really hot. Needless to say I didn't even bother trying to take it again. I went back and was prescribed 150mg Wellbutrin, took it for about 5 months, told my doctor that I didn't notice a real difference, so she suggested adding Zyprexa 5mg to help with my anxiety and my OCD. I haven't been taking the Zyprexa long, but I'm not expecting much. I also take Gabapentin for panic attacks and to help sleep. I cant be prescribed benzos because of my drug history.

TLDR: Taken a couple different medications for depression, anxiety, and OCD. Never noticed a difference when taking them. Scared that I'll have to jump from pill to pill trying something new and will never find something that helps. Would like to hear from others about how long it took to find a winning combination. Thanks.  

\*Edit: I'm also curious to know that if anyone that takes Wellbutrin gets crazy bad headaches from it. I have a history of migraines, so I am familiar with what it feels like when one is coming on, and that's what the headaches that I started getting after starting Wellbutrin feel like.

depression,"Life is depressing. I find it very difficult to function normally in our society. Every year that goes by the further I slip into this void. Life consumed by darkness. Shutting myself away from it all. None of it makes me happy... Its like i'm broken. 

So for the last few years I've been isolating myself. Fear and depression control me. Anxiety keeps me from being social and out going. Not to mention i'm a complete WRECK rn.. 

I don't take good care of myself. I don't see a point to. Why should I care what people think when they will be gone out of my life in a few months or so. The people who never left are my true friends and I have very few that I can actually bet on. Other than these people, I just don't care.. 

When it comes to work, im not lazy. I work really hard and my anxiety MAKES me work hard because I want to be valuable in the eyes of my peers. However, the expenses of life are to great. Working for 40+ hours, week by week. Just to stay where your at and be able to get back to work week after week. I cannot save any money to save my life. Ive had jobs making 13 an hour, ive had jobs where I was making 1000+ a week, I've had jobs making 300 a week. It does not matter. Money never sticks around. Between bills, necessities, entertainment and anything else you pay week to week or month to month there's just nothing left.  

I like having something to do and its even better when I got good people around I enjoy. But the problem is its still a life of treading water. Everything in our society is designed to make the vast majority of us debt slaves to have a decent life. They want you to be an employee. You think your gonna get this new job and you make a financial plan to save something and it never goes the way you thought it would.  Maybe today your tires blows up, or tomorrow you break your ankle. Anytime things are going good, shit happens. Nd 90% of us could not quit our jobs RN and be good for more than a few months tops. Yet we spend more than half of our waking time doing something we don't want to do for someone who's capitalizing off of your labor. Nd all of em tell you some fairy tell shit about how to be successful and wealthy, like any of us can just up and start a business and BOOM. 

Like it don't take a SHIT ton of collateral already saved up and all the kinks are ironed out as far as licensing and insurance and all that shit. Talking bout fear is why people don't take risks, MONEY is why people don't take risks, the lack of money.  

The cold hard TRUTH is none of us are really meant to be successful and retire. Were meant to be AS PRODUCTIVE as possible for whatever the minimal amount of compensation is at this time.

Give it a decade, he will be like Weyland-Yutoni. I mean fuck it its america right. If he wants to be a greedy fuck let him be a greedy fuck. Lets ignore companies like ford who actually do profit shares and bonuses for their employees. Theyre one of the few companies that actually profit share and give huge 4000 dollar bonuses to EVERY employee multiple times a year sometimes. 

Nd trust me Ide love to go work for ford but I cant because I cant quit smoking weed. I cant stop smoking weed because its the only thing that allows peace inside me. I cannot sleep without weed, cannot feel good without weed. My depression, 10x worse. Anxiety? 10x worse. Infact, not having weed has caused me to literally quit jobs at the drop of the hat. 

I just dont see a point to life you know? You either spend your life as a debt slave, going from one thing to the next, one problem after the other. Stressful event after stressful event. Nd you go NOWHERE but back to work, cause your shackled to all your various payments OR your a minimalist. 

Who is constantly struggling for money, constantly asking for help and paying people back, literally going day by day just trying to get by. 

Both of them are depressing life styles to me and it makes me wonder whats even the point? 

Whats the point of living in this world. I don't understand how everyone isn't blowing their brains out. 

All were doing is sacrificing the time we have in this world for other people to go out on vacations and buy condo's. We work so they can save up for a bigger house or a new car. People who will retire as millionaires. While almost all of their employees will more than likely spend the majority of their life working for a weeks pay thatll never save over in the long run. 

I realize this isn't most peoples problems, these are mine. Most people wont be able to relate to what im talking about or understand. Trust me im not proud of myself rn. I havent been in some time. Ive tried so many times to fix myself with pure discipline. Nd I cant... Living makes me want to die pretty much no matter what, the only comfort I can find is wrapped in a grape flavored wrap. Nd I know thats a sad life. Theres nothing you could say that could hurt me more than I hurt myself. I just dont know what to do. Nd im scared one day, ill end up committing suicide. Like I feel like im already on the edge and ive been living there for prolly atleast 4 years now. I used to be hopeful.. I never expected to be this way when I was growing up. Im failing at everything. Im lingering in this world. Im not living. 

Idk how to put it. I just want the pain to stop. I dont want to feel so bad anymore. Nd theres just nothing out here that helps.",What is the point,Anonymustardboy,2020-06-19 02:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbs74q/what_is_the_point/,1,1.0,5,4,1093

depression,"21M - I've had mild depression for like, 8 years now. Shit sucks man. Also diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

Background:

Grew up in a poor neighborhood, dealt with some (admittedly minor, but still affected me greatly) bullying (I didn't handle it well). When I turned 13 I was isolated from the world, even from my parents to some extent. When I did open up, I was told to ""get over it"" (but they have become more understanding and supportive as time has passed, thankfully). Wasted my teen years away playing games and not getting out and socializing, was bullied online and in real life for being poorly educated. Parents fought and argued quite a bit (some really, REALLY bad shit went down) which increased my anxiety. I went to a shitty school where I was breaking down crying in class while a bunch of rowdy kids were yelling and screaming constantly (I am really sensitive to noise, so that wasn't too fun). I literally refused to go because I couldn't bear it. Went to online school, which was actually good for me, but again, less time spent socializing and more time alone. Learned all of my stuff from there and research on the internet. Ended up eventually moving to a small town, moved in with my uncle. Eventually he kicked me and my parents out. Had to spend a few nights in a hotel with hardly any money. Thankfully to our efforts we were able to get us into an apartment complex. Currently have bills, credit card debt, and all this other mental shit going that's been stressing me out and now I gotta focus on finding a job. Things have gotten better, but I still feel shitty on a day to day basis. I know this will probably pass, but damn I just have to talk about it sometimes, you know? I've been so silent on all of these horrible feelings I've had, I just have to talk about them sometimes. I stay silent so long because I developed a hardworking, no-bullshit, and no excuses attitude growing up around the people I did.

&amp;#x200B;

How my depression makes me feel:

\-No energy

\-No motivation to get tasks done or try new things

\-Things that brought me joy before now hardly bring me, if any, joy at all

\-A lot of self isolation, due to lacking motivation to form social connections (it's hard to where I live, don't have a license yet and not a lot of social activities here, especially for young people. So I'm kinda stuck at this location for a bit).

\-I sleep like pure shit. Always wake up not wanting to get out of bed, have a hardass time falling asleep.

\-Always selling myself short. Always talking myself down. Negative and uncomfortable thoughts. Therapy has helped get rid of these.

depression,"I'm really hurting right now.  I'm on a family trip.  This week my therapist and one of the only friends left in my city told me to enjoy my trip, mentioned how fortunate or wonderful it was I could go.  I had a lot of anxiety on the flight because I possibly let someone cut in front of me in line to board and someone behind me said something passive aggressive about it.  I felt like I couldn't tell anyone because it didn't feel real, I felt like I was panicking for no reason and there was no reason I couldn't just stop panicking.  Two hours after I arrived, my mom was talking with my dad when I walked in, and she was crying and said she didn't feel like I loved her and that she was hurt because she had raised me and now I didn't want to be around her.  Over the years I've been spending gradually more time with my sister and aunt and less with my mom because they encourage me to be myself and celebrate my self expression while she criticizes and judges me.  She also said not to tell my aunt.  She was really upset, so I agreed.  When I was next with my aunt, she independently told me about a lot of trauma in the family, caused by family, that I didn't know about.  I don't feel like I can tell my sister about this because I've been chatting with her a lot over quarantine, leaning on her for support especially recently.  And family things are always stressful, and she hasn't arrived yet, and I don't want to prolong or worsen her stress.

depression,"       I realize that I can hope for things to get better all I want, but it won't really make a difference. Cold hard reality steps in and makes me realize none of this will change, at least without an exorbitant amount of effort and motivation which my depression has sapped me of completely. The sad thing is that in my mind suicide feels like a more desirable outcome than things getting better. It just feels so much easier at this point. Maybe I'm just lazy, but to me that just is another reason that I deserve to die. The world doesn't need people like me. Maybe I'd be doing everyone a favor by removing my lazy self from this world. It's not like I really contribute anything...

depression,"Hi all. 

This is something I‚Äôve been dwelling over for a long time. I hate my life. I hate my job. Not new for this subreddit I know. I went to University, dropped out over some misplaced fear of failure. Now I‚Äôm stuck in a dead end retail job. Without intending to brag at all, I‚Äôm rather intelligent, or so I understand. I have a constant fight with my ego. That I don‚Äôt deserve to be stuck in a supermarket, that I‚Äôm better than my colleagues. Then that I deserve to be here for my failure and I‚Äôm human just as them, the same. I‚Äôve written a few things, got plenty of drafts out, that authoring may rescue me from this life. But the world of potential authors is so saturated, I doubt I would even stand out. 

I read. A lot. Especially on the lives of ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô ones. It‚Äôs hard to read about Washington, Napoleon, Nelson, Frederick Douglass etc. And look at my own life and consider it worthwhile. Twenty-four and stuck in retail...I‚Äôd love to join the Army or Navy, as an officer, start to climb the ladder. But I have a fianc√© I love very much and I would be too fearful of her roaming to leave. I trust her, there‚Äôs just this intense fear.

Every day that I start at 4-5am, I think to myself, I could just leave a note, tell my family not to inform the emergency services so as to not waste their time. Put on my walking gear and just going. Getting some money out of a cash machine to survive for a bit, sleeping in the wilderness, taking my favourite book Cosmos. I‚Äôd be to scared to commit suicide in the wild. I wouldn‚Äôt want some poor innocent person to find me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve put it off for so long, I don‚Äôt want anyone to suffer that situation. Especially not family. I just want to go and see at least some serenity of the world, away from all the hustle and bustle. 

My plan was to hang myself. As I‚Äôm about to drop, dial an ambulance and they‚Äôll send one. It just feels so selfish. I tried, but my belt snapped...good job I didn‚Äôt call them. 

The worst part about suicidal feelings is the feeling of being trapped. You don‚Äôt want to live and you don‚Äôt want to cause people upset by leaving. It is such a huge dichotomy in feeling that can‚Äôt be compartmentalised.

depression,"Good evening people of Reddit, specifically those who follow r/depression. 
I am Peter and I am a person who suffered/suffers with SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder. Aka Seasonal Depression. 
So you may be asking, who tf cares, get to the point but I would like to share my perspective when it comes to depression and how to make it more bearable/tolerable. Keep in mind I am not here to CURE you as much as that would be amazing, like I mentioned before I continue to suffer from SAD for 4 years now. What SAD exactly is, is that during the months of winter, (for me at least) depressive symptoms emerge and eventually blossom into a season of depression. Last year, my depressive symptoms emerged during mid-September and lasted for 6 months up until April of this year. Specifically March 14. Pi Day. So peterlovespie has two meanings now. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know what you all are going through, as one of my favorite quotes says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ALL in the SAME game, just different levels; dealing with the SAME Hell, just DIFFERENT devils‚Äù which is very very true. Even with depression we all have different ways to cope, think, and that‚Äôs all fine. There‚Äôs no two depressive episodes that are EXACTLY the same. Much like snowflakes. But my symptoms included numbness, shortness of breath, a side of anxiety, insomnia and much much more. However, I did have an outlet to let out my innermost thoughts out there when I either didn‚Äôt have friends to be with me or I didn‚Äôt go to them because I was scared. Scared of being judged, laughed at, or even worse trying to understand then have them try to help me to make things worse. I wrote poems in my early stages. (If you‚Äôd like me to share them, please let me know in the comments) and then after a month or two. I shut down. I couldn‚Äôt get myself to get up, write a poem, eat, sleep, ANYTHING. So, I get why we‚Äôre perceived as lazy. But I know WE‚ÄôRE NOT. Furthermore, my friends started to take notice of my behavior shift and tried to help out but as the aforementioned fears state, it made matters a bit worse. But, I did open up to my closest friends but they didn‚Äôt really do much but give advice which is the last thing I needed to hear. Fast forward to April, I started to  get back into the groove of playing piano again and soon enough my season was up. I could finally see the colors that my mind turned into grayscale, feel the warmth of an embrace, I know most of you are either suffering right now or know somebody who is suffering and to you I say, there are 3 types of people with depression need:
1. A friend to shut up and listen
2. A friend to give them space when needed
3. An accountability friend that checks up on them maybe once a month

If there‚Äôs more, lmk in the comments but that‚Äôs basically all I need to get off my chest. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: Depression really sucks, and you WILL get through this.

depression,"My girlfriend is depressed. I feel as though I've exhausted all of our options, and I don't know what else to do. I've gotten her to make a habit of meditating, she's continuing to try medication, we've gotten her off of alcohol, nicotine, and weed, she's gone to therapy, I've now enrolled her in online therapy, and we talk at least once a day about it in addition to every night wherein it is followed by her crying herself to sleep.

I love this girl with everything in my being. She is truly the greatest person I've ever met, I've never talked to anyone who is a better fit for me. And she loves me intensely too, and she shows that every day.

Today she told me that she was upset but she didn't want me to know because she feels guilty for the toll her depression takes on me. Of course, she's right, it does take a heavy toll on me, but I feel incredibly guilty that she felt she needed to hide her feelings to spare mine.

I don't know what else to do for her.

1. Is it possible that she will never recover from depression, and that this will be our lives for the next 60 years? I can accept this if it is the case. Her with depression is a million times better (for me) than any neuro-typical person I've ever met.
2. Should I do more to help her, or do I need to step back for both our sakes?

Truth is, the past couple of years have been mentally and emotionally draining and i couldn't find happiness or satisfaction in anything. I was dealing with an emotional and mental break down all by myself. I couldn't talk about it with anyone and i didn't know if i was depressed. All i know is, i lost interest in everything.

depression,"I've always been depressed most of my teenage life. Everytime I manage to find or work something good for me, the world takes it away from me. This isn't just about the events of 2020 and how everyone has gotten hit hard. This is about my whole life. In the 17 years that I've been alive.

My parents are Muslims, they were born in Morocco from extensive families with no money, my father brought them to Denmark, where me and my sister were born. They both worked hard from poverty to a normal and quiet life for all of us. I was the firstborn and my sister was born 1.5 years later. We lived in a nice and friendly town, my father worked in the capital that was a hour drive away (or so it felt like a hour drive, could had been 30 mins). I had a lot friends there and really good teachers, I did my homework in time with good results and I was a pretty normal kid, my best friend lived in the neighbourhood and we would always visit each other.

Our normal yearly schedule was that my father worked all days except Monday and Tuesday, he was Co chief of the restaurant and kept it going when the owner wasn't there. Every summer, we would go to Morocco where all of our families were coming aswell and come back before the next school year, we always slept at our grandparents home. Eventually, my parents saved and built a house in Morocco next to my grandparents of my mother's side new home.

But then shit hit the fan, I reached 4th grade I think at the age of 10 and my parents suddenly decided we were gonna move out. I later found out that my mother was depressed in Denmark and wanted to move out, she was a housewife.

We moved to M√°laga, Spain. I was forced to abandon to all my friends and I didn't even have the strength to say I was moving, my teachers said that for me. I only managed to keep contact with one person, my best friend.

I was forced to learn a new language in a new cultural setting, the kids there were terrible, not even the clown of my class in Denmark could compare to them. I had not made a single decent friend ever.

In the 2 years we lived in M√°laga, we moved between two flats and changed two schools. My father still worked in Denmark, staying there for many months and coming to visit us for a few weeks. I had not made a single friend and I repeated a grade. 

A little explanation to Spains school system, there are 3 different grades for age groups, primary (x-12, ESO (13-16 meaning secondary) and bachelor (17-18). Primary had 6 years, secondary had 4 and bachelor had 2.

Since I moved, I kept contact with my best friend and we only played one thing together, Minecraft. I didn't own Minecraft until I was 13, we always played in cracked servers together, almost everyday. That's all I could do. 

We moved again, this time to Melilla, because it was so close to our home in Morocco. I only attended one year there in one apartment. I was 12 and attended 5th primary, I was supposed to attend 6th but my vocabulary skills could not keep up, halfway through the school year, the school placed me down to 4th primary just so I could manage, I was put with kids 2 years younger than me. 

After that, we moved AGAIN. This time, to Barcelona... Or so we though, we spent a few weeks in Barcelona at my aunts home from my fathers side, my parents tried to look for a home and school that spoke castellano, because in the province of Barcelona, they spoke catal√°n. We never settled there and drove the roads of Spain again, we finally settled into the right city. Granada. 

I should thank you for reading this far, because while this part will be the best, it's also the worst. 

Our first year in Granada was alright, I skipped 6th primary because of my age, I was put into 1st ESO with linguistic help. I found my strong points and weak points in the curriculum. I developed a disgust for Spanish literature and Geography History. We moved between two flats in the first year, I should also say that my contact with my friend has declined by ALOT. This was due to lack of Internet for many months and its removal many times. 

I had become 13 and my hormones and shit started, in my first year, I still didn't make real friends but I made ""friends"". The bullying still continued though, but I started to stand up to myself and got branded a chivato (a snitch). 

The teenagers of Spain are by far the most toxic and insensible people I've ever seen. And they all get away with it. I started getting into fights. 

After my first year, I swapped school for my 2nd ESO, nothing changed and I was still surrounded by douchebags and fake friends. While still failing at the same subjects. But I made my first friend, a kid from Ecuador. I had never had such a good friend since Denmark, we played together Cod and visited each other. But nothing last forever I guess, instead of me being the one moving out, it was him. I stopped contacting him after 2 years. 

3rd ESO, age 14. My mom placed me in the best school of the city and we had just finished renovations for our new flat that my parents had a loan to buy for. 

I loved this school, its very building had the sense of freedom Denmark gave me, although not completely since its still got fences and shit, but still much more breathable. I passed my first few weeks there enjoying and meeting people, I thought I could make things different here. Guess not really. Did I fail to mention that my mom didn't come with us from our last summer vacation? It was me, my sister and my father in the first few weeks of that schoolyear. 

My father went to Morocco to talk things out with my mother, left me and my sister home alone for a few days with cash and food. I was 14, she was 12 and attended 1st ESO on my school. When my father came back, he packed our things one day after arriving and we went to Morocco. 

There are 3 terms in Spains schoolyear, one lasting 3 months. 

My parents were divorcing, and it was fucking messy. We spent the whole first term there, my parents put us in a private Moroccan school, we had to pay for fucking everything when Spain offered it for free. I was forced to attend a school system that had 3 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening, we rode a private cab every fucking day and there was even school in the weekends. 

My father became so fucking obsessed with keeping  everyone together, he had us involved. And it hurt my sister a lot. At the end of it all, my mom took us back to Granada, and my father lost his job trying to keep things together by the next year.

I failed 3rd ESO, I got back to it by the 2nd term, never had the will to put effort after that shit of a divorce, but hey, I found my first friendgroup, a real friendgroup. I had found my love for anime and this friendgroup, although mostly consisted of girls, shared that love of anime and videogames. Particularly 3 friends. 

In all these years, I had been so alone and gained no social interactions, I found it always hard to start convos and surprised how easily accepting they were of other new people and how they grew friendlier faster than what I could. 

I repeated 3rd ESO along with 1 of those 3 friends. Turns out I found this one friend to be relatable, she had her parents divorce at the same year as mine, her mother was from Morocco and although she didn't move around, she never had friends until 1st ESO where she met the other 2 friends. As the repeat year passed, I grew to like that girl but later understood that friendship is better.

Life was hard after the divorce, the debts we owed the bank started pilling up and my father had financial trouble to help along, but I mother saw it as an excuse. She never brought us in, she was always defending herself, but now she became just as dumb as my father was. She revealed to my sister, that my father had married another woman and had a son, the woman died after birth and he left the firstborn in a orphanage, I was never the firstborn. She revealed this to my sister first, after that to me. I was confused, my sister started hating my dad. It would only be years after I realize, my mother is the one who truly caused the downfall of my sister. She never had a reason to reveal that. To this day, I haven't talked about it with my dad. 

I found my profession, I wasnt fully sure but I wanted to do something with art, I started drawing since I moved to Melilla, it helped me cope and I had grown to become good, I was always the best one in class until I met that girl,whose art was much better than mine.

I passed 3rd ESO and went into 4th ESO, I decided I wanted to do bachelor of arts and get into the art school of Granada. I made a lot more friends that year and learned more about them, I became more open but still had to deal with douchebags. I also learned that girl had a half brother just as old as my half brother, only difference being they live together with their common mother. I found the coincidence to be fascinating, as if the cosmos brought two people of the same background life together. 

Me and that girl both wanted to go to art school, we both applied and got denied. We had both given up hope, my mother didn't though. She went to a place where all the school applications is handled and applied me there, after summer, me and my sister were sent to Granada alone, my mother would come two weeks after. She had told me to go check on my application, I didn't want to because I knew J wouldn't get accepted. I lied and she ended up going herself, they told us we would be contacted once the schoolyear started.

In the time that me and my sister were homealone, my sister was prohibited from leaving alone or having friends over, I let her have some fun. Biggest mistake ever. The only reason I allowed her was because I had been sneaking my laptop out of my mother's room every night before she went to sleep, so I could use it for some time when I was grounded from it, my sister knew that and took that as a favor.

I should say this, at the end, my parents sold the flat and split the cash, my mom didn't want to split the cash, she wanted 75% for ""us"", my father knew better that she has become a money hogger. And took the 50% himself. My mother rented a new flat and my father bought me a new PC for my career. 

Once the schoolyear started, it was my first day of bachelor of socials. My friends were still in the same school, that girl came to class a bit late though. After I came home that day, my mother got a call in the evening, I was accepted into the school of arts. 

Day 2 of the schoolyear, we spent the morning doing paperwork and all that, day 3 I went to my school to get myself removed and say goodbye to my friends, I also found out the math teacher was a complete douchebags who thinks i should had informed him that I didn't come to school at day 2. Glad I ain't seeing him. I only regret not saying goodbye to that girl, I thought that it would only hurt her if she found out that I got in and she didn't. Since she was the one who informed me about that school of arts. 

My time at the school of arts was marvelous. You don't get a better chance to make new friends when everyone doesn't know each other. I made real friends I could trust and there was never a single douchebag ever. It was a paradise. 

Shit hit the fan again. Worse than anything. 

My sister made a new habit, going to the library almost everyday. After a few days, I suspected something and told my mother, my mother spied on her somehow and grounded her. She wasn't going to the library, she was hanging out with her ""friends"". 

It was only 2 weeks before a convention for weebs and gamers. Something me and my sister attended every year for the past 4 years in Granada. She was banned from going there and my sister got mad. 

The day it happened, she ran away from home, after I came home and learned about what she did, we went to look for her. We came home with no luck and she didn't even wait at the door. Next morning she came home and was grounded harder. 

It was only a matter of time. One day I came home from school, we were waiting for my sister, she usually takes 5 min tops to come home after me. She didn't come, I got a call from a classmate of my previous school where my sister is still attending. She found her in the nearby playground, drunk, without her sweater on. Ambulance took her to the hospital.

We went there, my mother almost fucking fainted and cried her eyes out. I was fucking shocked, I already had bad relations and fought with her a lot but I never expected her to go bad bitch like this. 

Worse of all, that school had 3 yearly meetings informing about dangers of alcohol, sex, and other shit to students. This has been taught 3x every year and she was always there. 

I spent in the hospital the entire evening, waiting for her to get sober. She had intoxicated herself with vodka. A boy came saying he was with her, he looked old but claimed to be the same age, I trusted him. I also looked old but was younger than people though. 

He explained what happened and she had drank vodka. He spoke with police and was let go. My mother knew he was lying. 

I went home alone, barely managed to catch the last metro of the night. I sat on the couch and saw myself see that everything was a fucking lie to my sister. 

My sister was allowed to go home, and they both came home. We didn't ask her anything, we just let her rest. 

By the next day, she said she couldn't remember anything, that it was all a blur. I had made contact with her friends and the school, she had been skipping school. 

The questions started and thus, our family was no more a family, she became violent, disrespectful, she didn't want to speak, she attacked my mom and wanted to break my new laptop. We had police come to our home 3x to knock some sense to her.

She left her Instagram open and I found everything I needed to know, yet there was more. She had been sexting, talking drugs and when to get them, all that shit. And the one friend who we knew the most and that my mother trusted, knew about this and lied to my face about ever fucking knowing. 

We brought her to a government funded institution to help smokers better themselves. She didn't want the treatment, thinking she is fine but we forced her. She was scheduled to get back next month. 

Things calmed down, but not. She was expelled and spent the rest of the term in her home, my mom did not want to look for a school until she got some treatment, when she did get treatment, there was no school that could accept her


Halfway through the first term. A new student joined my class. Turns out, the same method my mother used is the method the new kid used to get in, and it still works. I contacted that girl about it and she was excited to do it. 3 days later and she joined my class, I introduced her to my classmates and my friend group who we were already really good friends with and she fit in nicely. 

What felt like was hard to obtain friendship for me in those 3 years in the last ESO school, suddenly became so easy in the 3 months of the first term. 

My grades were good, REALLY good. I had never gotten such good grades in Spanish before, I had the best Spanish teacher ever, using methods no other teacher ever used. I got a 8 when the highest I ever got was a 5. My low self esteem for the bachelor started boosting. I was confident in my studies for once. 

I found my real profession, video-game design, I started to learn programming, slowly but surely. I was waiting the most important date to truly start, 2020 new years resolution. 

She ran away, my sister, after being trapped in our house for many weeks and only allowed outside with my mom, took my keys and ran away. The door was always locked, we never trusted her. She did not come back home that night and we found her outside the next day, lying about throwing my keychain away. My mom had decided. 

She wanted to move away, back to Melilla. 

Day after day, I tried to convince her not to, that she could get treatment and we will find a school 

I even fucking told her that its OK if she repeats the year because I FUCKING REPEATED A YEAR AND IMPROVED MYSELF AS A PERSON. 

She didn't care, all she could see was a way out, where she didn't had to deal with the law and could ""save"" my sister, but at what cost does my mom think she can save her daughter? 

The 1st term was over, and my mom started packaging, we went from finally getting rid of that debt to my mom loaning 2k euros from her brothers to move between Granada and Morocco 6x with a fully loaded car. 

Her first trip, it was new years eve, I still planned to follow through with my new year's resolutions, after my mom left and it was just me and my sister alone, she took the opportunity, found my hidden key spot while I was sleeping and left. I spent new years eve alone, thus started 2020. 

I informed my mom immediately, for my resolutions I wanted to learn game development everyday and took personal hygiene properly, I even exercised everyday. This lasted only 3 days. 

My mom came back quick, my sister returned home and went back to her room with nothing to say, I told my mother everything to do to check her, we found my keys in her sockets and tobacco in her bra. She isn't just a manipulative liar anymore, she is also an expert of keeping secrets, luckily for my mom. Those years of having no friends have taught me how people act. 

My mom took another trip with the car loaded, this time I took better precautions, kept the key and cash with me at all times, when I slept, I would put it inside my pillow, in an unreachable place. Imagine my horror when I woke up at 8 Am, to my sister standing over my bed, I knew she was looking for the keys, I told her to get out and I went back to sleep. She came back inside my room asking for the TV cable, she was not allowed to watch TV without supervision. I told her to fuck off and go to sleep. I eventually gave in, she started making breakfast and told me to go take a bath cause I was stinking, it seemed liked a normal morning. I took my keys and cash into the bathroom and hid them in the cubicles, while I was taking a bath, she slowly creeped in and took the keys then races outside, I was forced to leave my bath and wear clothes quickly, she got away. 


I felt betrayed and violated, I didn't want to do my resolutions, I reached depression once again. She eventually came back after a few days, I didn't want to let her in but I had no choice. When my mom came back, she took her with her on the next trip. 

Christmas vacation was almost over, every day alone in that stupid house felt like torture, I never knew living alone in a medium sized flat felt so exhausting, I never had the strength to write in my class WhatsApp that I was moving, not until the first day of the 2nd term. 

My friends sent me alot of messages saying how they will miss me, even the girl, I told her what happened cause she knew my sister and she was shocked. 

The very resolutions I planned to myself, the new me, was a failure immediatly.

After 7 years of moving out of Denmark all around Spain, after living in Granada for 5 years. I had finally regained my social abilities and found real friends in an environment of my own choosing that I'm happy with, only to have it all stripped away by the very same person who decided that we were gonna move 7 years ago.


The first half of the 2nd term was wasted in moving, I was stuck in Morocco with my mom wasting her time doing personal shit, she never even prioritised finding a new home in Melilla, our new flat ended up being a very small flat that my mom was paying slightly more than what we did in Granada. We managed to get WiFi in our home in Morocco, but in Melilla, we didn't have any WiFi until the very day that Spain went into lockdown. 

I spent the remaining 2nd term in depression, playing games during the weekdays and suffering with the WiFi in Morocco, which we are paying more for a speed of 12mbps when we had 300mbps for less price, with much better infrastructure and latency. 

The online games that I played usually became nothing but sources of stress after the move due to the inferiority of the new WiFi. 

I did find friends in my new art school, but that place was worse than my last ESO school, the teachers barely cared and their system was drastically different, what became a understandable and slowly enjoyable Spanish subject for me now reverted back to the same disgust I had for it for the whole of ESO. 

half of the class consisted of douchebags, and 99% of the class doesn't even draw. Only 4 out of 40 can draw and only 3 do it with passion. Inclusing me. The rest are there because they think bachelor of arts is easier to do. 

The school itself was a joke, we were sharing classes with a ESO school, whose school building did not finish building and they were ""allowed"" to operate in the school of arts of melilla. 

Worst of all, what was the reason we came here? To help my sister recover, she didn't. She stole a bottle of vodka and sold it to a homeless person, she also stored alcohol in her water bottle and hid it in her backpack. I told to my mom that day ""I warned you, once you are in it, you never leave. My sister will not recover, she will not listen, and whenever she finds the chance again, she will do it again. We moved away from the best life opportunies for nothing"" 

Nearing the end of 2nd term, exams were coming. We already had the habit of going to Morocco on weekends, the border would take hours to pass through. One day, school ended on a Thursday, I had an exam on the evening. (Did I mention they do exams on the evening??? And their exams are supposed to last 2 hours unlike the usual 1 hour? And every Tuesday, class starts one hour earlier but still ends the same time?) my mom didn't want to wait, I wanted to do the exam. She told me I could cross the border on foot and wait for the WiFi technicians to come. I accepted. 

She forgot to leave the passport to me. She took my laptop, the WiFi got installed and I did my exam. After packing up and sending a msg to my mom that I'm coming. I went out and locked the door. 

I arrived to the border on foot, turns out, there was a lot of people than normally. Little did I know, the president just announced that Spain is going on lockdown and that Morocco is closing the border on Friday. Had I chosen to stay the night, I would had been stuck in Melilla with no cash to live on and no way to leave.

The Moroccan side of the border stopped me, they normally never ask for passport since anyone who does enter Morocco is definitely moroccan but they did for me. I didn't have it and they brought me to the office, after some talking, a guard offered me Internet to call my mom. She came and picked me up.

The lockdown happened and online school began. I had to wake up 1 hour earlier just to be able to attend it. It was hellish.

I was already depressed as shit, knowing I barely escaped the border and being stuck in melilla, I knew it was gonna happen eventually but I didn't expect it like that.

Online school was a fucking mess, the 2nd term was over and I failed it.

Once the 3rd term started, timezones had changed and now I had to wake up 2 hours earlier, I was done with it.

Any class that was too early, I gave up on. I tried attending any I could, but I would always overslept and miss most classes, before I know it, I had missed so many assignments and classes, chances of me succeeding the year was impossible. I gave up, never attended or responded for the rest of the term. 


Every fucking night, I would lay awake wondering how the fuck did I get here. How did my dad abandon my half brother and if I should seek him out. How my mother came to the conclusion that her easily resolvable mental health was more important than our growth as kids. How my parents act more children than adults. 

Will I ever get out of this mess? Is my dream even still possible? Will I ever get to see my friends again? 
Will I see her, the girl who helped me cope after my parents divorced and I helped her have a chance in her dreams? 

My mom says everything she does is for us, she has given all her house cut (50k euros) to my dad for his new restaurant in Netherlands. Money that could had been used to never make another loan, money that could had paid my college expenses (2k euros).

Even in debt, my mom has had the audacity to buy a 4k TV, to make small renovations and constructions in our house in Morocco. Even a modern day US college student wouldn't do this if he had the cash. 


It just hurts so much, and everytime I try to open up to my mom about this, she makes this about herself, that she risked it all for us. 

She says she will never go back to Granada, and my only chance of getting back would be if I pass 1st bachelor and she would rent a student apartment, something expensive and that I cannot do. 


I've read a lot about people's life stories, their ups and downs, and how they always get their good ending. I don't see a good ending, I see myself having been born with all the opportunities and being dragged down to a land where labor pays worst. 

I don't know, if I ever will get the motivation to restart my learning in game development, I have ideas, great ideas but I just can't manage to stop depressing myself, I'm afraid that this cycle will repeat and that nothing will matter because my life is the same cycle of ""give me something good, give me something even worse"" 


I don't want to die, I just want to be happy. I would prefer living in a 3rd world village than what I'm living now.

depression,"Idk I‚Äôm just making this post to see if there‚Äôs any other teenagers like me struggling with academics and depression..

I‚Äôm 17 and have been trying to apply to scholarships starting this summer and they all make me realize how horribly average i am, academically. Every time i look at scholarships or study for my upcoming ACT, i get so discouraged and feel the urge to give into old habits because of the stress and the idea that i never improve. I‚Äôm fucking tired of the voice inside my head telling me i should just commit now before shit gets harder u know? I don‚Äôt want to commit but i hate being depressed.

All of my peers around me seem to be enjoying their lives on social media, probably no fucks given about college since their wealthy parents are paying for their education. That‚Äôs one of the reasons i deleted social media because it‚Äôs just another way for me to compare my lonely ass life to everyone else with friends and stuff. 

The only thing keeping me from suicide is my younger siblings. I don‚Äôt want them to grow up with that pain of having an older sister who killed herself. I also can‚Äôt leave my mom who depends on my help. I just don‚Äôt want to fucking be here i wish i could just disappear. 

Sometimes things feel hopeful when i listen to music and ride my dad‚Äôs bike. I wish i could listen to music and ride my dad‚Äôs bike for eternity.

Also FYI not saying that stress from academics is the only thing that makes me suicidal or depressed. There‚Äôs so much more i could talk about but thats just the main thing currently that has made me feel discouraged especially when no one talks about it and preparing for college is depicted as some inspirational eye opening bonding thing. 

I also don‚Äôt mean to come across as another American kid who undervalues the importance of education. I come from a family of immigrants who have worked hard for everything. The stress of success makes me feel so anxious. I‚Äôm very grateful for all i have but my depression is making everything so unbearable.

depression,"(I haven't been on this sub before so idk if it's discussed here more often or if it even happens to everyone but I have basically never heard of people talk about this aspect of depression) Seriously, before I had depression I didn't have the slightest idea that it would effect your memory and every time I mention my fucked up memory people are always suprised. I can't think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life. I can't explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff i've said or done and I can't properly remember it myself.

Edit: everyone probably doesn't have this and it's not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect. Like some people have said it all just blurs together. I think it has something to do with how you don't really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them. I mean I can't remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so don't know what's that all about but it's kind of a relief that im not alone with this.

depression,"I have been driven to give life a shot out of the shame of being a burden and destroying the lives of people around me after spending an entire year practically bedridden unable to motivate myself to move. I managed to get out of my bed but I haven't been the same. 

There is a deep sadness within that is kept at bay through a constant balancing act and I know that if I slip it'll consume me again. I set up goals and they distract me with the so far false notion that I will find myself and a joy in life if I only manage to do it. If you do this thing, you won't have to suffer anymore, life will have meaning  and you won't ever feel this way again. I tell myself over and over.

On paper it has worked out great! I moved out on my own a few years ago, a prestigious education with a bright career ahead of me! I started lifting as well and after several years of strict programming and diet my physical health is better than ever- as a result of self punishment for my self percieved laziness. I still hate my body but now instead for what it symbolizes rather than for what it looks like. I have physically manifested the fake persona that I live every day, every time I interact with anyone. This perpetual hamster wheel that I am seemingly unable to escape.
I have only been motivated out of fear and self loathing and I don't think I will ever be able to break loose.

The same goes for my personal relationships. I met this wonderful girl and we were together for a while and even then I felt like I couldn't be myself.
The person she loved was a fraud and a front that is completely fabricated, the jokes I tell bring me no joy, I am completely quiet and somber on the insise. I just told them so that you would spend more time on me, my opinions weren't genuine, they were twisted to become pallatable versions of my thoughts. I just said what I thought she wanted to hear, only being capable of bringing myself to be honest when I felt that it would be beneficial which makes me sick. It's like I calculated risk and then decided whether I could actually say how I felt or not. 

As in every aspect of my life my own terrible point of view and behaviour leaves me feeling isolated even from those I love.
I shouldn't be surprised that it didn't last and I miss her a lot but I can sincerely say that I think she is better off not having me in her life.

I spoke to several psychiatrists when I was younger and still living with my parents but as per usual I didn't really give it a shot and they just put me on SSRI's which had absolutely no effect, no notable side effects even. I consider going to see someone profesionally a lot but I honestly don't think that there is anything they can do for me as I fear I might just be fundamentally broken to some unknown capacity and I don't even know why. It's like I woke up one day when it first started having lost all sense of meaning and I've just been grasping at straws trying to retrieve it ever since.

I don't even know what the point of all of this was, it probably doesn't come off as particularly coherent but maybe somebody else has felt the same way about their situation.

depression,"I have suffered from depression for a lot longer than I have been diagnosed. I started meds late last year hoping to make a difference after trying many other methods. Right now I am in a depressed state, I think a work event triggered me but not really sure but I know that I have been pushing away those I love and being rude to them, like I dont have a filter. I dont care about what they have to say or what they want to do and I just want to be left alone which I have expressed to them. Hearing them laugh or sound like they are enjoying life makes me even more upset. When I first started my pills I found they assisted and I would get upset and want to avoid everyone but would wake up the next day and be fine, now this feeling doesnt want to go away and although I feel bad for how Im treating those close to me I also feel like I cant stop and part of me feels like it wants to be unhappy. I put on a face when I go out or communicate with those other than my boyfriend to try and make it seem like everything is okay but its getting harder to do that but I really dont want to seem like a b****. It‚Äôs summer and I do want to enjoy life but at the same time when I see others enjoying life I get this horrible feeling inside and dislike them and feel a hatred towards them. Honestly just not sure what to do at this point, I dont want to be so negative but I cant control it, or I subconsciously dont want to.

depression,"Depression isn't always crying your mascara off in the shower and playing sad songs in bed. Sometimes it's not wanting to talk to anyone for days, not taking a shower for ages; or, at other times, it is desperately needing to be around people. Sometimes depression is having no appetite even though you haven't eaten anything since yesterday and sometimes it's eating everything in the fridge until stomach bursts out (look it up; I ain't making shit up). It's keeping secrets from your loved ones because you don't want them to look at you like you are broken. 

No, depression isn't a beautiful monochrome Godard movie. Depression is lonely, dark and scary. And committing suicide is not being coward, it takes every broken cell in your body to take away your own life. So all those people who think they are an expert in giving trashy internet advices, should stop judging people who commit suicide by saying they are cowards, or degrade them. It is easy to pass comments sitting in your comfortable bed and not having the slightest bit of idea what depression does to a person.

depression,"
- I‚Äôve been thinking about us so much the past month. I‚Äôve been also suppressing emotions and looking the other way when it comes to our mental stability and how toxic this is becoming because i wanted to be with you. I want my bestfriend. I want my girlfriend. And i kept teetering between both of those much lately. As much as i love and need my bestfriend, i still can‚Äôt see my life progressing without my girlfriend. You‚Äôve been in my life for so long. I can‚Äôt lose you. You‚Äôre irreplaceable. I know this must hurt you too. Break ups bring up the worst in everyone. The ugly sad hopeless side of every person. It‚Äôs sometimes portrayed as hatred towards the former partner. Sometimes it‚Äôs portrayed as a competition between both partners and who‚Äôll end up feeling better or I don‚Äôt fucking know and i hate these kind of people. Sometimes seeking revenge or trying to inflict pain. When i think about it, i feel disgusted. I see it as the equivalent of stabbing someone. The motive is similar; wanting to inflict pain, seeking revenge, hatred, abuse and such. Verbal abuse might not show on the victim unlike physical abuse. They‚Äôre so different and i surely can‚Äôt compare one to the other, but verbal abuse is just a road to physical one. I guess what i‚Äôm trying to say is that i know your motive isn‚Äôt bad nor mine. But the ugly part of me that comes after break ups isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôll like. The ugly side of you that comes after break ups, I‚Äôm not ready to see. The problem with your ugly side is that people think it lasts for a month or something then you pluck up the energy and get right back on track. I know it‚Äôs hard for you and I know how tough it is. I know you hate being grumpy. I know you don‚Äôt like yourself when you‚Äôre sad so you go back to your comfy place and that place is a positive loving caring extrovert. That‚Äôs hard. I know it‚Äôs not that simple. I know it takes a lot of energy and it drains you till you actually find something. That somethings grows and you start to like it and like your life a little because you found something you want to grow; your love for that something. You start feeling better and sometimes that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre okay. But one thing i found in common between all the times you were okay and not forcing positivity, is that you get rid of the remains of your relationship. You never want to destroy the relationship and you always want an amicable exit. And that‚Äôs it. An exit. That‚Äôs when you get better but i‚Äôm not gonna come here and convince you that this is about how i know what‚Äôs the best for you. I‚Äôm just saying this is my observation and i also wanted to say that this isn‚Äôt what i wanted to say. I‚Äôm trying to say is that i can‚Äôt stand that ugly side of yours because it‚Äôs also so nice to see from the outside. If I didn‚Äôt know you I would‚Äôve thought you‚Äôre doing better. You‚Äôre doing okay and you‚Äôre happy. You are radiant. When you want positivity, you naturally radiate positivity. My ugly side is jealousy and obsessiveness. I never got jealous because my argument was i have you. You‚Äôre my girlfriend. Now i have nothing. And it builds up. And it burns me from the inside. I take a negative approach bas with a good outcome. I distract myself with work and important stuff. I eliminate my social life. I go to my own shell. I deal with my own problems. Then after a while, after getting better, i start looking for someone who‚Äôs still willing to be my friend. I tell him/her what happened and i slowly build up my social life again just to crash it later on. I‚Äôm not a positive person. I like to be happy. I would love for that to happen but i won‚Äôt do anything to be happy at the time i‚Äôm getting over someone or generally depressed. So in this time, I‚Äôll just he obsessing over you, from close distance which will drive you crazy and later on cause a whole lot of heat between us which leads to me deeply hurting you even more and even furthering you more from the idea of us if i wanna be that guy. You know how cheesy i am so you get me right?
- I can‚Äôt stand hurting you anymore. You‚Äôre the most important person in my entire life. You‚Äôre my lovely sweet bestfriend. You‚Äôre my whole world literally and it‚Äôs not worth trying if you‚Äôre not there to cheer for me and pat my back. You‚Äôre so supportive. I just can‚Äôt make you cry by my mistakes anymore. At least when you cry that i‚Äôm not there anymore is better than crying because i‚Äôm such a stupid asshole dick. Right? At least you won‚Äôt hate me right?
=Are you cutting me off?
- No. Yes. I dont know. We‚Äôll see. I just can‚Äôt stand feeling this way and i‚Äôm feeling this way because i‚Äôm starting to feel jealous which trust me is the beginning of half of our fights. It all starts here and builds up and goes off and you end up not being able to talk just because it got so complicated. It all starts here. This is the point where you‚Äôll try to reach two months from now but you won‚Äôt find the words. It‚Äôll be because i got jealous and obsessive just because i got overwhelmed by the fact that you‚Äôre not my girlfriend and life will move on. I tried going on fb today for the first time. I found you tagging me a couple of times and a couple of old reacts. I swear to god it took a minute to get triggered by something so bad I deactivated facebook. This is the kind of things i do and is okay but not in this situation because we‚Äôre bestfriends. We‚Äôre talking and we‚Äôre hanging out. It‚Äôs either i delete you or my social media and obviously it was an easy choice. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs this whole conversation is about. I turned my head away and suppressed my anxiety and feelings in general. I looked away. That‚Äôs what i do best. I hid. This is the toxicity i‚Äôm talking about and I‚Äôm sure on your end there‚Äôs similar things that happen. But to be fair, i‚Äôm on the wrong. I convinced myself that i was right and i am right if we werent still bestfriends. I convinced myself that this is what i have to do for the sake of our friendship. We‚Äôre killing each other. By the time we save the friendship we will no longer be. I really need this friendship ya rana and i‚Äôm willing to deal with my own emotions and not torture you with these details but it will yield a spark that ignites a fire between us and it‚Äôs not the nice kind of fire. We‚Äôve been burning for months and all we did was throw gas at ourselves. We were burning and we had the tanks and surely we won‚Äôt burn each other so we spill it on ourselves. While standing close to each other. Thus, creating a bigger flame. Im fucking using big words up in this bitch that‚Äôs how you know i care. I‚Äôm doing metaphors and idioms. Where is my fucking idk nobel ? I hate hurting you. I hate not being around you and you know it‚Äôs better for me to stay close.
- I mean first of all you are literally my world. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to login anything since we talked but i just wanted to find nice memes to tag you. The past couple of weeks where the worst weeks of my life and i compare them to that depressive episode back in sophomore. And that year i lost a lot. I mean it. But this two weeks felt heavier than losing my mom to a stranger. My car and self esteem to an accident. My friends. Even my grandma. And that time was horrible too because there was unresolved issues between us not because all the drama. You‚Äôre my entire world and i always knew it and i always denied it because i was fucking scared. I was fucking scared that we‚Äôll come to a day where you can‚Äôt be my world anymore. I always knew it and when i say i denied it i dont mean that i said you weren‚Äôt nor acted as if you weren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre never in the same place. You move around alot and you have a lot of friends and connections everywhere. You are genuine and caring towards all of them and you put me first im not gonna deny that. I‚Äôm going to be 100% honest. I dont want to be competing with someone else. I dont want to share my place with anyone else. I‚Äôll still be your bestfriend. And you have mariam you know? I want to feel special. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you make me feel special but i wanted another kind of special. I swear to god i always did and that was the issues i had to deal with before we got together. I build barriers so i wont let myself fall for the fact that you‚Äôre my world. Because as big and huge i am to you, it always feel like i‚Äôm sharing with someone. I might have the biggest share, but when someone new came along, (as new friends i‚Äôm still talking about before we got togther), you get distracted for a little bit. I miss when i was the guy you told your friends sbout. I miss you taking me out with your friends and the whole ‚Äúmeen seif da‚Äù phase. I felt so special bas now i feel like it aint anymore but it‚Äôs just s constant that you cant let go because i‚Äôve aleays been there. I see nothing special now about me which makes me obssesed and jealous that‚Äôs why i build barriers. That‚Äôs why i invented aw got so attached to ‚Äúda seif‚Äù. It was an argument we used to used and i build a home and a comfort zone henak. Delwa2ty hatta ‚Äúda seif‚Äù, we lost the rights to it. All the times i felt like there‚Äôs an issue i had with you were always the times where there was someone new, new friends, new people. All of the times were just because i got jealous and mad. I knew all along that you were special and i was special to you. But i always want my own place. So being just your bestfriend is someplace i was 5 years ago. When we were texting after finals. Im so sorry but I can‚Äôt go back to not being comfortable around you. I can‚Äôt care now about how you see me because i‚Äôm in a shitty place already. I can‚Äôt be your bestfriend. And i cant what we used to be before getting together. You‚Äôre my sister but i cant see you like that anymore. And even if somehow we did see each other again as a family, i dont think anyone would accept that which is the second reason why it‚Äôs better for me to stay close. I can scare anyone off by just being there. Which will have negative effect on me too and will put you in a difficult position. And i can dwell over you as much as i want. I dont mind just seeing you grow and seeing you happy. I‚Äôve been watching you grow for the past 6 months and my god nothing brought me much joy. Nothing on earth brought me joy as much as seeing you grow and be better and lately maybe you hit a rough patch on some aspects but in other aspects you‚Äôre doing fucking amazing. Progress isn‚Äôt just not linear. Progress isn‚Äôt just one aspect. You might seem like you‚Äôre failing in something but generally you‚Äôre doing fantastic. I can‚Äôt be around you without eventually hurting you. I cant be around you without getting hurt. And i‚Äôm sorry if i seem inconsiderate. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt see how much youMre already suffering and i know your life doesnt revolve around me and there is so much other shit that goes in your head. I know this is coming off as one sided. It is. This is me telling you i dont want to be a bad person. I dont want to be hated. It‚Äôs all about me. Im self-centered. I even say that to make everything revolve around me. And that‚Äôs my biggest flaw. I try to put myself in the other‚Äôs shoes but i dont really. You‚Äôre an amazing girl. And i love you. I cant find anyway out of this. I cant be with nor without you. My life is horrible khlas.

depression,"I‚Äôve tried writing this about a hundred times. Every time I begin writing, I end up deleting the post because what‚Äôs the point of writing this? Nothing‚Äôs ever gonna change. 

I guess I‚Äôm writing this now just to finally get it all off my chest. If I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt think I have a lot left in me, but hey maybe someone here will be able to help. 

I first realized I had depression in 7th grade. I realized that it wasn‚Äôt normal to always be sad; and it definitely wasn‚Äôt normal to have constant thoughts of killing myself. Fast forward 7 years and I‚Äôm still having these thoughts every single day. It‚Äôs easy to say now that I should‚Äôve tried to get help in the last 7 years but the truth is I don‚Äôt know who I would talk. I have a terrible relationship with my family (I think the fact that they‚Äôve never noticed that i‚Äôve been depressed these last 7 years is indicative of that), I don‚Äôt have any friends that I‚Äôm close to, and I don‚Äôt have money for therapy. I‚Äôve only ever told one person and that ended up making my depression 100x worse but that‚Äôs a story for another day. 

Life went on and I learned to live with it. It didn‚Äôt really affect my life, and I was great at hiding it. During the day I would be the happy guy that always had a smile on his face, but every night i‚Äôd be crying myself to sleep. That‚Äôs pretty much how all of high school went. 

Anyways this last year I felt like my depression was progressively getting worse. I began losing hope that I was ever gonna get better. And then, in a desperate attempt to put some hope into my heart, I decided to fall in love with a girl. And not just any girl, my closest friend. I fell super hard and put all my hope that everything was gonna be okay some day into her. I guess my depressed mind mistook every signal that was there and thought she liked me back so I decided to be honest with her and told her about how I felt. Not only did my plan backfire and she said she didn‚Äôt like me back, she also said it would be best if we took a break from talking. 


So yeah that was a week ago and now I have nothing left. I have no friends and no one to talk to. My depression is at an all time high. I literally can‚Äôt function anymore. I wrote a rough draft of a suicide note, planning on finishing that up later. So yeah that‚Äôs where i‚Äôm at right now. No more hope. 

I would just end it all right now but I‚Äôm too pussy to do that cuz ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to burden my family‚Äù and blah blah blah. I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, i‚Äôve never been this low.

depression,"All of those things happened this year.

My life was pretty bad: abused and beaten when I was a kid, which led to me not sleeping and going to school, which led to me getting bullied and getting bad grades, which led to me getting abused and beaten again. 

I had gotten over it all... at least thats what I thought. After my mother (the one who abused and beat me the most) died, I started having issues again. 

Those issues destroyed my motivation to keep going with my life and made me kill the relationship I had with my girlfriend. To make it worse, my grandmother (the one who took care of me for years) had a stroke, a heart attack and underwent surgery all in the same week. 

I have been sleeping constantly for weeks now. I wake up to eat some leftovers, go to the bathroom and lie down again. 

I stopped talking to everyone that I know, not that it makes any difference, as they didn't even notice I was gone. My birthday came, only got a few messages from random people. 

My entire life has stopped, but I dont have any motivation left to keep going. I feel worthless. 

I wrote this because I needed to write down my thoughts somewhere and think a bit before I lose the little energy that I randomly got.

then i had a best friend, and then i had a boyfriend...i was so happy, i felt like i could die right then and there, i wouldnt give a flying fuck, everything was perfect, i had a best friend, i had a boyfriend who loved me, my life was going right...but then he left me...i...

i was not enough...

and then, my best friend turned into a very toxic person and i had to go...

now im alone again

why do i always end up alone? why couldnt i be enough? why couldnt someone love me too?

i dont understand what is wrong with me...why does everything always go wrong? what am i doing wrong?

sometimes i wish i was cuter, or thinner, or smarter, or funnier...i wish i was better, cause even if i try a 1000 times, i dont think i'll ever get it right again

depression,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons.

So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director.

Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else (i only stayed at community college before doing mortuary school online ) because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety/Depression so i didn't get to join a frat/ meet girls at parties/ etc on campus . The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day( my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist). I have had some big and small anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this.I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse.

I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS,everyone and my twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS/MS due to my Anxiety/depression over the last 6-8 years. I feel like i can talk to guys easier then girls, i don't talk/text to a lot of girls which is fucking 0 girls.

Also i use tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday/ puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety/depression. i don't know that why girls on tinder don't reply to me or stop talking to me after 2 messages but most likely my speech impediments. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off for my speech and anxiety. i told everything to My mom/my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds ( i signed up for a gym before covid came), i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too, (slept 2-3 hours last night). i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too. I just want a normal life since i am at my fucking wits end right now too.

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. My speech is only affected too. What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ?

depression,"I can feel myself falling back into the bottomless pit of depression but I'm trying So. Fucking. Hard. to avoid it. I went and got a haircut, visited my mom, folded laundry and thought I did a pretty good job even if I wanted nothing more than to stay in bed. My husband came home from work and immediately started pointing out things I didn't get done. He got over it almost immediately but the problem is, I didn't. My brain is incapable of letting anything go and it'll be another sleepless night thinking of every failure I can remember from my 24 years. 

This weeks breakdown has been sponsored by the asshole driver who hit my cat on Monday. He was my unofficial emotional support animal and the loss of him has left me feeling utterly alone. As a mom and wife it feels like no one cares about you as a person. It's always how's the baby, what's for dinner, why is (insert stupid house chore here) not done? Never asking how my day was, if I need help with anything. I'm over here proud of myself for getting the laundry put away in a timely manner and here comes the world screaming its not good enough. My cat didnt care about any if that. He was just happy to see me and appreciated whatever amount of attention and effort I could give.

I'm trying so so fucking hard to keep my head above water but at this point it feels like just delaying the inevitable and prolonging the suffering.

I just, don't think I want to live anymore. Everyday I'm depressed, everyday I feel like I burden people with who I am. I can't go a day without just feeling so damn depressed that I completely shut down. I've been trying therapy (although not recently) meds and all that jazz. It hasn't helped much, if it does it is only temporary. I just don't want to live my life this way anymore, trying to make change but never having anything to show for it.

I alps don't want to drag my friend down anymore or my family. I know constantly having to vent is tough on her and I try to keep it from my self, it's difficult to just not sound depressed when she asks what's wrong though. I feel like I'm going nowhere.

I feel im destined to be this shut in loser who'll never found love or a real purpose in life. It doesn't seem like it could happen and honestly, why stick around for it? Why have hope it'll be okay when anytime I've had hope it's turned sour. I genuinely do not want to do this anymore.

depression,"So, I've had depression since I was young (according to my therapist), but it always came in small bursts. 2 years ago I decided I was going to kill myself, I'd just had a huge fight with my mom, broken up with my gf of 3 years and was kicked out of my parents house with my dog.

So there I was walking down the street with my dog thinking about how to do it, I'd read about a guy that almost died from drinking an entire bottle of soy sauce (Great Idea right?!). So there I was about to walk into the supermarket when my dog started whimpering like craaazy, almost as if he knew what I wanted to do, I tried to ignore him but he started yelping frantically. That snapped me out of it, I was being selfish and was going to leave this poor boy alone in this world... I was all he had, since then I decided to try therapy and it helped a lot.

Fast forward to today I moved to Canada and started a new life here along with my doggo, however suicidal thoughts coming back, friends and family are far away and quarantine isn't helping.

I've always been the type of person that hates asking for help I feel like I should be able to do anything on my own, I am also kind of an introvert so reaching out feels awkward as fuck to me.

Just fucking damn. I had really been hoping we were both wrong, and we could still be, but honestly I doubt it.

I've been doing research lately into everything I can about bipolar and the partner's role in their treatment and everything, and I've been thinking back to my own experiences in therapy and with medication, and the idea of him going through all of this, and, subsequently, also affecting me sucks so much.

I gave money, so did everyone. And I was glad to do so, everyone was glad to do so... But the selfish part of me thinks ""no one would do that for me. my parents wouldn't even know who to ask"". 
Next week is my friend from college's birthday. Her mom called me to invite me to a suprise birthday party. No one would come to mine. My parents wouldn't even know who to invite.

Not every pills are deadly. I am only gonna say this.

Strangely, I am calm. When you try two times, and even lost my stomach in the process, couldn't get to just die. I should had the courage to end it in the gruesome way, but I am a baby and I don't like pain. Got discharged from the ward after cleaning me, they took weeks and got the 72 hours hold. Thank god I live in a rural town with bigots that don't really care about mental health. I would be homeless soon, so even if they are going to ask me to come, they would not find me.

Who would thought that after a suicide attempt, life could get shittier than ever?

there‚Äôs so many times when i just look in the mirror and i just hate the person that is looking back at me i hate her and i just wished she could be normal. i just cry for being who i am. there is a part of me that loves myself but the hating always takes over.

His parents do not know this and all of us are very overwhelmed with the situation. We've gotten him to get drug help a few days ago but just today he tried to kill himself by taking 5xanax and drinking a bottle of vodka.

I've had depression and anxiety for like 11 years and PTSD for about 7 years (due to a violent assault and rape...both separate incidents, 6 years apart). All the recent bullshit in the world has got me feeling hopeless. Looking back on my life, I was always at least good at pretending to be happy/faking it. Currently, I feel like our country is so fucked. I feel like I am surounded by inconsiderate,  bumbling-ass, boorish, idiotic assholes. 

I am a teacher, so my job at least gives me some purpose, but it feels like it has gone by the wayside with all the online stuff. Also, I am in a super low paying district which doesn't help with feelings of burnout. I know I am fortunate to 1. have a job and 2. have the ability to work from the safety of my own home. Fuck though...all of this has me feeling crazy. Fuck the virus. Fuck racism. Fuck homophobia. Fuck transphobia. Fuck the bi-partisan system. I'm over all of it.

I feel like the world is turning to shit. My attitude is rapidly spiraling downward. It is becoming increasingly difficult to fake being ok and nice. I feel like a big shitty phony when I pretend to be nice to people. I almost always have something shitty going through my mind with any interaction with anyone. I am slowly getting shitty with customers (general public) who I find irritating during my summer job.

I'm lighty medicated. I see a counselor on a regular basis. I just feel like this isn't me. I feel like a grumpy, numb, asshole whisp-husk of a person. I'm 31. I feel like I shouldn't be so goddamn jaded and shitty.

depression,"And in its depths, I found myself again.

Caught in an ever entangling web. The momentary glimmer of hope seemed to grow more and more distant with time. Was any of this real? I often asked myself. Still banging my head against a wall.

A few moments of peace is all that I had desired. Though, despite casting several illusions of growth, stasis seemed inevitable.
There was always something expected of me. And these expectations only grew.

So much so, that soon I started expecting things from myself. I fought hard to convince myself that I could live upto these expectations. But is living worth it? Even if I fulfill these, the next set will already be knocking on my door. Where do I stop then? When do I stop? Is there even a halt?

I wish I were strong. As strong as everyone around me. But the truth is, I am not. I get scared easily. I try to hide my weaknesses by helping others overcome their's. In the hope that someday, I'll gather the strength to overcome mine. But that doesn't seem right lately. A new problem, somehow always finds it way to me.

I am tired of pretending. I just want to be happy again. Be passionate again. I don't want to be caught up with worldly struggles. Sometimes, I don't even feel like existing. But I know a lot of people care for me. And I don't want to see them hurt. But I don't want to hurt myself either. I wonder if the world would be better if I didn't exist.

Everytime I see people mourning suicides, questioning the motivations of the doer, telling them that it wasn't an act of strength, I flinch. What do you know? It takes immense courage to decide to let go of yourself. Even more than living. When the uncertainty in life increases beyond the uncertainty in death, the act of letting go serves as one last attempt at grasping for hope. In believing in the beyond.

Even for someone as expressive as me, sharing what I feel is difficult. Even with the people who care the most about me. What will it achieve? Can I even be helped? I have ambitions too, I want to live too, I have tried to actively change too. Just because my efforts aren't visible doesn't mean that they don't exist. I try. I have tried. I am just tired now.

It's an ongoing struggle to come to terms with everything that's happened and with no way to process it, I have a bad habit of shutting down everything and becoming an emotionless zombie. I start to ignore critical chores and tasks, bills pile up. I don't do anything but write in my book, and sleep it off to pretend that everything okay for once. It's happening again, but I can recognize it now. 

Things aren't going well here. I have tried to forgive my sister in the past for hurting me, and forgive my parents and myself for hurting others, but in some ways than others, I had yet to even let go of the anger I held onto for years, and it's biting me in the ass. Instead of dealing with the problems like I should be, I get angry quick, and lest, i accidentally hurt someone. 

I really want to get better. I really want to stop hurting. Its a big step to even come to terms that I have feelings, because of the many years I was told not to deal with them by my peers and my family. I could go on for hours about it, but I am pretty sure you guys didn't want to hear it right now. It's a coping mechanism to write instead of dealing with how I feel, and I have definitely slipped back into it again. I feel like I messed up, and I don't want to come to acknowledging that I messed up again yet, even though I know I have. 

I'm not close to taking my life anytime soon, but I know that if I keep it bottled up inside for long enough, I'll think the same way again.

depression,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right spot, so please point me in the right direction if it isn‚Äôt. 

Long story short, I (21F) had a decent childhood. Lots of good times, but my parents had a shit marriage and I never really got along consistently with my dad. He moved out (without saying anything) when I was 11 and lives across the street with his mom (close distance, but still didn‚Äôt contact or see me for months at a time). There‚Äôs too much detail to get into why we don‚Äôt get along but our relationship has been on a steady decline and practically nonexistent for years. 

Now here‚Äôs my new issue- I‚Äôve been opening up to my boyfriend about everything recently because he‚Äôs witnessing my parents‚Äô and my family dynamic first hand (we moved in with my mom because of rona). He‚Äôs offering a different perspective that isn‚Äôt sitting with me, and it‚Äôs making me depressed and angry. He says he sees that my dad is mentally ill (which we all believe, but he won‚Äôt get help and therapists and doctors that we‚Äôve made him see have literally given up on him) and has good intentions most of the time, but it comes off totally wrong. Again, can‚Äôt go into complete detail, but it‚Äôs basically showing me that my mom might not be so great either and my dad isn‚Äôt as bad as I thought. 

I have no idea if he‚Äôs right. I almost don‚Äôt want him to be right. If he was, Ive spent years throwing away my relationship with my dad and have wear rose tinted glasses when looking at my mom. 

I‚Äôm just so confused. I don‚Äôt want him to be right.",Getting a new perspective on my family relationships is making me depressed and angry,squidlygrace,2020-06-19 02:09:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbs1ws/getting_a_new_perspective_on_my_family/,1,1.0,2,14,287
depression,"I'm sorry that this is so long. I have not talked to a therapist in years and I am too afraid if being a burden to my friend's by reaching out to them. I have a lot on my chest.

I just want to say first of all I didn't have the worst relationship with him. But it was not good either. Whenever I have late night conversations with my brother and we end up talking about him it usually ends with us concluding that he was abusive, but he meant well. And as far as shit fathers go we fared pretty well considering how much worse we could have had it. 
My father's passing definitely affected me way more than my brother. I was 14 and the older one and I had way more memories of him. He was also a lot harder on me than he was with him. He never hit me over ""nothing""but he would always freak out over the mildest things. He once chased me with a knife and slapped my ass with the honing rod for sharpening knives and dragged me to my room. My crime was asking too many questions while he was cooking and just being mildly annoying. He later apologized to me but he made me apologize back to him and promise to not be annoying ever again. I was 7. Kids are just naturally stupid and annoying

I thought that the reason he was a hard ass was because he was an immigrant from Mexico who had it rough living in a really poor area and that trauma stuck with him. And it didn't help that he was an older father who unexpectedly had me at 50 and was too set in his ways to accommodate a kid. But I realized it didn't matter if he grew up rich and had me at 27. His problem was that he was never emotionally mature and he was not going to suddenly have it when he was old enough for the senior menu at Denny's. 

The realization that my dad probably wasn't doing the best with what he had came only in the past few years. I hang out in a diverse crowd but over half of my close friends are Latino. We kind of like to play games where we see whose parents were the worst because usually Latino parents are angry. I realized he wasn't a normal Mexican father when my friends stared at me in silence and wide eyed and told me that he was crazy. What set that off was telling them that my dad would compare me negatively to other kids and would tell me that the kids at school were talking bout how unimpressed they were with me behind my back. The other thing was that he would make me stare at myself in the mirror because I had chapped lips and told me that I was a shame for it. 

Me and my brother didn't live up to his standards. He wanted us to be the best in class and told us that when we grow up the only thing that mattered was that we went to college and made at a minimum $100,000. He would hit me the most whenever I did homework with him. He would make everything a lot harder and I was scared of setting him off. Usually after a long night of him getting upset with me and making me cry he would apologize to and give me a shoulder massage when I didn't want him anywhere near me. And he would still expect me to boost his ego by asking me to compliment his ""teaching.""

Summers were also bad. Instead of hanging out with friends I was indoors doing ""homework"" assignments that he made up that were redundant and taught me nothing. And when he looked over my shoulders it was like walking on egg shells like with REAL school work. He especially lost his shit over a kids word search packet. I was not solving it fast enough for his standards so he got really upset and started screaming at me and hitting me. I literally thought about asking him for permission to be a kid during summer break. Also he never placed this amount of pressure on my brother.
I know it is a cliche to blame your parents for how you turned out but I feel like I can definitely blame him. My self-esteem is non-existent. I'm almost 30 and I never dated anyone seriously. It's not a fear of commitment or anything. I still don't think I'm worthy of being loved. And deep down I am scared that I will be a shitty significant other like my dad was. He never hit my mom but he did speak down to her and he held her back because he never had a consistent job and was mostly useless. I'm worried that I will be the same way. 
I still want to be a dad and a husband eventually. But to be a better one than my dad I have to be comfortable with myself. I can blame my dad for destroying my self-worth but I have to take responsibility for never trying to do better. I'm not ever going to forgive him but I am ready to recover.",This weekend is Father's Day.

In high school I was a manipulative   piece of shit and made everything about myself and pushed everyone away, even tried to make my crush at the time break up with her boyfriend, real despicable shit I regret and haunts me to this day. I hate who I was and I've tried to hard to distance myself from that and be a better man and for a while I really did. In college I had a perfect life, made friends and I got lucky and got the best girlfriend in the world, and I now I failed her. She feels neglected and like i dont make her a priority. I know it's a tough balancing act but since I've moved back with my parents they've always stopped me from seeing her, they dont mean to (I hope) but they're emotional abusive and everytime I go to visit her they give me shit for it make my life a living hell or stop me from doing it and its put a massive strain on our relationship, not just my parents but my fear of them. I pushed my girlfriend too far and we've had a really bad fight and I dont feel comfortable and I cant go to my friends for help because we're in all the same group chats and I dont want to turn them against her.

Things started getting worse and worse and worse and then suddenly it came to an abrupt halt, and I stopped having bad thoughts, but instead I just had no thoughts, and no emotions. That was a few weeks ago and it stayed like that for a while, but when school ended I feel better kinda. I get some joy out of things, although its limited. I don't feel like shit all the time, and my mood is generally okay. But where did it go?  Is it normal to have such a mundane thing like school make you depressed but be fine when it stops? I couldn't do any school work as hard as I tried and I felt awful for so long, and now its gone. Was I just faking it so I didn't have to do work? I really feel like all my depression was faked right now. 

Maybe school is the cause of my ""depression,"" or at least some of it and I'm fine when it ends. Maybe because I already have a hard time doing work, I get bad grades, which make me feel bad, which makes me distracted and harder to do work, so I get worse grades, i get in trouble for it, and its just a cycle of that. and when school ends, I don't have that type of stuff to worry about, so maybe school is the only reason for depression if I ever actually had it. 

I still have some of the other stuff I had when I was ""depressed"" though. I hate talking to people, I hate touching people, I constantly don't do stuff or miss out because of stupid fears of what other people will think of me, although that stuff sounds like something else. Maybe I have depression and anxiety but the depression is caused by school, and anxiety something else.

depression,"First time ever writing, I know there‚Äôs a lot wrong with it

From a young age, women, men and the whole society are branded into a certain group of people. There‚Äôs the popular, the anti-social, the gamers, the geeks, the list goes on. I often think people don‚Äôt mean to do this but come on the whole concept of life scares people, so they think fitting into a group of people is easier then fitting into the world but do they really fit in‚Ä¶? 
I think they want to believe they do, the world needs to realise the pureness of each individual and realise the crushing pressure we put on young individuals to fit in. Forcing a girl to fit in to the popular group so she mask her feeling and covers her face to live in a life that isn‚Äôt her, we force the boys to learn all the football terms and all the latest game so there in the cool groups and so they try to mask the fact they don‚Äôt like who they are anymore.
The story is closer to my heart then I like to think, Girls are always told from a young age weather from the bullies or my inter demons that they don‚Äôt belong, THEY WONT BELONG, WE WONT BELONG.
the fact that a young girl from around nine years old has to now start watching over her shoulder sat at the school dinner table in case the school bullies are coming over, but what will she get called today, freak, nerd.
No not that today, that the girl could handle, she‚Äôs used to that, it feels like that vocabulary is normally, it‚Äôs just everyday life. But no, today wasn‚Äôt like the rest of them, the school bullies walked straight past without a word, without a stare, the little innocent girl was relieved but didn‚Äôt show it, just so the bully‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt notice and circle back around like angry vultures. The girl almost felt bad that maybe they have found someone else. But that‚Äôs the lesson the world teaches us from such a young age is that we look out for our selfs.
The little girl was silly to think it was over, three o‚Äôclock strikes and the bullies are stood out the school gate, this was the magic age when a young girl gains the independence to walk home by herself, however this little girl was no long glad of this independence, she felt unsafe.
The girls, the bullies, the vultures whatever you want to call them, followed the innocent girl home, shouting horrendous names at her; chubby, ugly, weirdo, freak the list went on but when the names turned into action, then she got scared. 
She learn to run as fast as she could that week, she needed to be home where she was safe. The young girl had to learn to put a brave face on and wait until the door was closed to break the wall down and let out the tears. 
Two weeks went by and nothing had changed over than the young girl changing her emotions, she was no longer scared but no, not of the bullies, she was no longer scared of dying.
That day the vultures got braver that normally and waited outside the young girls house, she didn‚Äôt know where to go, what to do, her safe place was gone. They stood verbally abusing her until she broke down the the floor, that‚Äôs when a spying eye from across the road saw and spooked them, the girl didn‚Äôt have a clue who all she knew was she was grateful.
Later that night the young girl broke down on her mother‚Äôs lap after visiting grandparents because she couldn‚Äôt handle the pain of being locked with a demon in her own head. This was no normal day, it was way from it, this was the day she was sexual assault by her own grandfather.
The young girl didn‚Äôt feel innocent or pure anymore, a tiny nine year old girl didn‚Äôt  feel she had a life left to live anymore, she begged her mother to make the pain and the heart ache go away, she was too afraid to tell her mother about the grandfather so she simple said she didn‚Äôt want to go for a while so she didn‚Äôt upset them with how she was feeling. Her mother did anything and everything a mother of a child could do, we spent endless weeks confronting the parents, the teacher but it was no use, that‚Äôs because the girls was branded as popular, popular girl tend to have the motto, we were just having fun and even better there parents motto was girls will be girls. 
So after months of fighting and failing the little girl was home schooled, the most important years of primary and she missed it, the trips, the prom, the friends. The girl didn‚Äôt care about this she had too much going off at home, a young nine year old girl had too much going on how can that be right, how can that be a possibility in the world we live in, when did this world become a place I don‚Äôt want to be in.
The girl sooner after becoming homeschooled had to go through seeing her grandparents again where the same tragic events kept having over and over for months. 

Fast forward a couple of months and nothing has changed other than the girl has to cry herself to sleep, not knowing any other way to cope or any other way to deal with the pain or the past. But this was no ordinary night, this was the night before she goes to high school, the new start for her, all this girl can think about is weather she‚Äôs branded the freak for life.
So the morning comes and she didn‚Äôt know what to think, but her mother was excited so she had to be, she didn‚Äôt want to cause anymore pain or heartbreak to anyone. She walks into the overwhelming hall and everyone the same, young, scared, nervous and in that one moment she‚Äôs not scared or overthinking, this was a fresh start for her to move on.
The young girl thrived, she meant friends, real friends, not like the ones that stabbed her in the back, the real kind she couldn‚Äôt believe she was capable of it. 
That next two years went so quick building so many memory‚Äôs with amazing people, there was just one person in her life that was not so amazing or pure, her grandfather. Even though she managed to get out of endless visits due to homework or after school clubs, she was forced to go this time as it‚Äôs been to long without seeming them. The girl was forced into a shed in the corner of her granny‚Äôs house and abuse physical and emotional. After an hour there‚Äôs an knock at the door saying home time. The tears of relief roll down her face. The girl couldn‚Äôt handle the feeling of being used or scared or broken anymore. So she does the only thing she knows how to and goes hope to her safe space and cry‚Äôs, this time was different she had a best friend who she trusted to talk to and to calm her down.
The next day the young girl got called out of lesson to the guidance counsellor. When they muttered the worlds ‚Äútell us about your grandfather‚Äù. She couldn‚Äôt believe this moment had come she was let out of the cage, she was angry for her friend speaking out but always relieved it was over. Later that night the young girl had to speak to her family and authority about everyone, the authorities didn‚Äôt believe her as her grandfather had a way with words, but her family did, even in the darkest moment of her life they stood by her.
From that day she and her family never spoke to what She calls her past again, she thought it was over that it would all be better but it wasn‚Äôt she was left with the demons in the head, he came with a roller coaster of emotions and panic attacks.
The girl learn to mask her feeling and buried them deep down where no one could see, instead of bullies, she battled the worse enemy ever...herself. 
What the girl didn‚Äôt remember was she was not alone no matter how alone she felt, a couple of weeks later the girl was found killer in an abandoned bullied she had been raped and murder, she went to that building because that was the only thing she knew that was the only thing she felt like she was useful for, that she was needed for, she couldn‚Äôt handle the feeling of being ashamed anymore, she was now at peace maybe not with her self but with her demon inside. 
The true realisation is that if we didn‚Äôt have the type or groups of people we wouldn‚Äôt feel like we need to change our selfies, we wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to stand up for our self‚Äôs, we wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to ask for her when inside were screaming for help.

depression,"Although I had friends to hang out with my first few years of college, I really got a semblance of genuine feeling for the potential meaning for certain friends. My last year, it was finding love for the first time with a new girl in the group as well as bonding with a few others. I felt myself drifting from others. It ended poorly with this girl in my opinion from my own end in terms of the emotional and other consequences for me. Although I hung out with this group later on after being better on my own, the same feeling wasn't there since I changed in perspective compared to older friends. I've always drifted alone and assumed on and off that my life is an unreliable uncertainty in terms of my desires and feelings. I moved to a different city and had fun with people who got to know the changed me and matched up with the ideals of my growth. I moved back home and no longer feel that connection through not having stayed in touch through text or call. If we were to meet in person, there are only so few that I would genuinely perhaps enjoy the company. Within those few, I have emotional hurt associated with the memories of the past. I want to fade into a fantasy and develop myself solo and develop my hobbies and skills and assume that this is a new phase where maybe I don't get as close anymore to people and friends. I still feel hurt and am not ready to open or interested in initiate the steps to open up. I'm the same person, changed, but I'm getting older. Maybe I have feelings for some people but neither party is reaching out and I'm choosing to soak in this feeling of bitter sadness at innocence and closeness that may have felt very real in the past. I know that no one loves me or that I'm not capable of the normalcy of staying in touch with the many people you meet throughout life. My connections very rarely peak but they tend to fade for reason of distance or whatever not. I'm trying to understand that if anything, my life will pass without pure love of feeling at home with people who can relate to my perspective the older we are getting. 

&amp;#x200B;

That intimacy is gone and I have closed myself off and am cold and am severely out of practice of empathy and socialization. Whenever I come back, I'm going to be sad that my past is out of touch once again as I go through different phases of life without having someone to stand by my journey. Maybe this is an exaggeration but I know that I feel deeply about it and Ill let the other person forget about me so that I can fade away to being this ghost of a human once again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also growing older in the uncomfortable sense of neglecting my desire for a feminine lightness to my life that a relationship with a girl could bring. I've avoided it all my life. It's too painful to comprehend something that I don't want to imagine since it sounds like heaven and one of the peaks of human experience but knowing what I know growing up since a young age, I know that this is not for me or out of touch for me. I can dream and try to emulate it through temporary moments of euphoria but I know fundamentally, to ignore this intensely because id never let myself get that far or close with anyone again.",lost the closeness to all my friendships and avoiding dating for life,galaxyfloating,2020-06-19 00:37:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbqmhu/lost_the_closeness_to_all_my_friendships_and/,0,1.0,2,12,606

depression,"Hi all, I'm writing this out for a couple of reasons. One is that I want to see how I am feeling compares to your experiences and two as a record that I can look back on (I think writing things down helps so much but rarely do I do it).

So here it goes.

As a background I've been diagnosed with dep and am an meds.

Felt pretty much ok on Monday, not great but ok. A little stressed from work but nothing that I couldn't handle. A few things happened later on in the week some work related stuff (said I didn't want to work for someone and it got out to them) and some personal stuff (felt that a friend had started to become distant for some reason). On Wednesday I really noticed a shift in my mood, became low and irritable, started to withdraw. Flatemate had a friend over but I hid in my room (my thoughts were that I am such a looser that I am ashamed to be in the presence of normal people).

Thursday was worse, a really struggled to get out of bed, couldn't concentrate on work, started to feel there in no point in the work I do. Again there were guests over, but I hid. Withdrawing from workmates and housemates. Suicidal ideation again. Feeling so angry with myself and the world. Nearly in tears (I never cry).

I've pretty much stated in bed all day today. I dont want to talk to friends. Some moments of felling better, but the clouds return pretty quickly. I think the approaching weekend isnt helping. I am lonely and ashamed of how lonley I am. I just want to be normal and have a normal life. Thinking about getting old alone - what's the point when you havent made memories with anyone? I have plans fo rending it when that time comes. It is a comforting thought to me that I can 'opt out'. All the 'good stuff' I was thinking about myself and my futures only just a few days ago seems like lies now and that I was delusional for ever believing it.

I guess what Im asking is if this has happened to you?

depression,"I've suffered from depression for years. Diagnosed when I was 16 but I suspect it was festering for at least several years before that. Also 99% sure I have ADHD but can't get a diagnosis or treatment for that because I'm not a disruptive five year old boy.


I want to die. I don't have anything to live for except not hurting my parents... but I'm starting to think they hate me being alive as well. I'm a burden. I can't do anything right. Every time they tell me they love me or hope I feel better soon it just feels like meaningless platitudes... like that's what they have to say because they're my parents. Rationally, I know that's probably not true, but it's getting harder and harder to believe that.


I moved back in with my parents just before lockdown started in full force in the UK. At first it was pretty good, my mum especially made a big thing of fussing over me and looking after me. Then I got furloughed after working from home for a couple of weeks and things started to go downhill. I still thought I was doing okay until about four or five days ago when I went from ""mildly to moderately ehhh"" to barely being able to get out of bed, crying multiple times a day for little/no reason (e.g., my parents didn't say hello when I went downstairs to grab a drink = they must hate me and wish I wasn't there), and having no motivation to do anything, even play my favourite games.


I've been terrified of saying this to anyone because it feels like a fast track to being labelled as schizophrenic, but it's like there's a voice in my head. It's callous and cruel. It tells me to kill myself over and over every single day, just a constant stream of abuse. That I'm stupid, worthless, useless, fat, ugly, just kill yourself, nobody would miss you, you have nothing to live for.


Just before this latest slide into deep depression, I was following up on some job prospects that would take me out of London (where my current permanent address and workplace are) back up north to Leeds, closer to my parents and in an area where property prices are much saner. I thought it was the start of getting my life properly on track and getting to a place where I could be happy. Now I don't think I can ever be really happy like normal people are. Even if it all worked out and I bought a house... I'm useless at cleaning thanks to executive dysfunction and just being a slobby bitch. I have this image in my head of a beautiful Instagram-worthy house but I know really I would never have that. I don't deserve to own a house. I don't deserve anything.


There's something deeply, deeply wrong with me that I don't think can be fixed or even managed so that I can function properly long term. I've tried medication but have enormous problems remembering to take it (tried alarms, reminders, everything) and the constant on-off-on-off makes me even worse. I've been to counselling when I was at uni but was shoved out the door the second I admitted to the mildest improvement in my mood and then when I inevitably needed help again I was put on a six week long waiting list.


The only counsellor I feel has ever helped even a little was an old guy I saw in sixth form who basically let me spend an hour a week in his office crying and saying very little while he made small talk and didn't judge me for struggling. I really doubt I'd ever find that in the NHS (because, understandably, they need to free up spaces for people who can actually be helped) and I can't afford private therapy.


At this point, my only solace is hoping I can one day get a big lottery win or some other improbably windfall that would let me buy a house in the middle of nowhere so I don't bother anyone and nobody bothers me and I can just be alone without having to worry about work or socialising ever again.",I don't think I'll ever be happy,mollymostly,2020-06-18 15:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbh23s/i_dont_think_ill_ever_be_happy/,5,0.86,10,7,701

depression,"So, I am a 22M going through depression and I really need a job. I have only internships to put in my CV, I studied hospitality. I already lost an year (I took 4 years to graduate instead of 3). I struggled with loneliness and severe social anxiety, due to my awkwardness and lack of passion for life, for the last 3 years (I moved from my country of origin to pursue my dreams) + use of illicit substances. I was depressed last year too, but everything was going well, I had a career project, I was finally content with my life and academic performances, until the quarantine came up. I feel like my ""wings"" have been cut off. So back to square one, I was diagnosed with depression again, and ADHD to put the cherry on a cake. I had 2 interviews, and for the first one it was for an MBA at the same school I graduated from, the recruiter ""gently"" told me that I look stressed and that she can see I have no experience in taking interviews. The second one was for a retail job and it was online, I fucked that up as well, as I cannot concentrate at all. My father thinks I am only a  spoiled lazy brat, but I really want to change...just there is no ""body"" reaction. I don't know who I am anymore. 

So, fellow redditors who found a job while depressed how did you do it ? My lack of self confidence levels are going through the roof, how an I supposed to strive in this world? I am lost.

But here's what I've found out, when i think about suicide and life or death situations, i feel like someone shot heroin in my veins, it feels THAT good . Anticipation of Violence&amp;Danger feels euphoric to me, i don't want to hurt anyone or myself but this line of thinking is very ""motivating"",  the anticipation of mortal danger alone is rewarding enough to make me do the things i need to get my life back on track, the irony is so funny i can't help but laugh.  My brain is offering me a Cocaine tier high in exchange for putting myself in extreme danger. Perhaps, suicidal people don't really want to off themselves, maybe they just want a near death rush to feel better?  I know, i do.

I believe these are consequences to Sensory deprivation. we are a social species  and our survival rate outside groups is low, our brain compensates for it by anticipating death. I suppose, acting out and being hyper-aggressive got our lone wolf ancestors succeed.

I have had mild depression for years that got very bad after having my second child. My antidepressants were switched/dosage adjusted 6 times, with no improvement.

I had doubts I had BP2 because I have never experienced anything that resembles hypomania. I figured my doubts were just denial. 

I finally had an appointment yesterday and questioned her on what led to my diagnosis. She said it was because I said I had signs of early psychosis??!?? I have never had any symptoms like hearing/seeing things that aren‚Äôt there, paranoia, jumbled thinking. She revised my diagnosis to unipolar depression.

depression,"tl;dr: How do I kill my jealousy when meeting new people who have their shit mostly together.

I'm at a point in life where I feel very behind. So naturally when speaking with new people I meet online I feel as though I've entered a minefield of sorts. The minefield being that I want to avoid them telling me about goals and achievements thus far in their life. Whether it be, that they have a partner, or have a good job or even that they've started a family. I'm good at pushing through the initial sting of jealousy, but when every person you meet seems to have much more going for them than myself, it weighs down like a ton of bricks.

I get it, jealousy is a big no-no. I don't wear it on my sleeves, I feel it, but I keep it buried, but it tears me up like a son of a bitch. I want to start connecting with more people in life to drag myself out of this crummy mindset, but I'm really not looking forward to being reminded of how much I let pass me by in life. I've done pretty much nothing for the last like 8 years, I'm 24. I still manage to keep it together, but I feel as though I am going to start cracking and give up all the way. This is not fun, the jealousy is pure shit, it's my goddamn achilles heel. 

I'm not jealous of the fact someone has a partner, i'm jealous they've got the get-up-and-go to get one. Not jealous of the jobs they have, but the fact they can get up and go do them day-in-day-out. It's people's drive i'm jealous of, I have zero.

depression,"Hi All,
I had depression and social anxiety(severe) for for almost 15 years. Last 8 years, I had continuous excessive stress for  and my depression has increased too. I didn't seek any professional help. I had a long list of symptoms and for last few years those symptoms were really affecting every aspect of my life. I'm specifically concerned with memory loss, not able to study, brain fog, being numb and feeling disconnected from reality.
My short term memory is especially bad and in some days it's worse than others. I noticed that it's specially bad early morning when preparing for going to work, I almost don't remember anything in those times. My longer term memory isn't great either, for my work I need to keep studying new technologies, but no matter how much I study I keep forgetting. Also, I forgot almost all my childhood an high school. Probably I can only come up with few names. I used to have very sharp memory. 
Also I'm almost always having brain fog and often a headache. Sometimes I get sudden relief from brain fog and suddenly I feel the huge difference between clear mind and having this brain fog. This affecting me so much in getting and memorizing new ideas. And this makes feel like numb and walking corpse.
So now would you please share with me the expected time that it will take for those symptoms to heal if I seek professional help?

depression,"Greetings,

I'm looking for an advise. I'm a 17-year old guy from Europe. I've been suffering from depression and social anxiety for 1-2 years now. Recently I started looking for help and eventually I found a therapist. We talked about therapy options. She suggested antidepressants (ssri) and a cognitive behavioral therapy. But I'm unsure about it. My mental health problems definitely destroy my life and I need to do something about it but I've read some bad things about antidepressants. I don't really care about side effects like nausea or loss of sexual drive but things like increased suicidal thoughts scare me a lot because I had a few suicidal thoughts so far and I'm quite happy about the considerably small amount. Also some people claim antidepressants don't work for teenagers. My mom isn't to happy about antidepressants either but I'm the one in charge so it's my decision. So I decided to ask the people of reddit if they have some advise. I'm really hoping there are some people willing to share their experience with antidepressants.

I started getting therapy a few years ago and when i asked for it from my mam she went and found me the ""perfect"" therapist.
It wasnt in bad faith but she got me a therapist i could literally be friends with, that she knew i could relate to.
This was a bad idea if i had known thats what she was doing i would of intervened.
The only thing I've gotten out of my therapy is being able to talk about thing that bother me to another living person (I have never spoken to anyone else about my problems it makes me very uncomfortable) beside that ive been the one doing  all the work, i only discuss things I've already figured out for myself because she never asks about specific things she only ever says ""so how are you"" at the start of our sessions and i feel like it would be less awkward for me to get into all of my shit if she felt like a therapist instead of an adult friend.
Recently its started to feel more and more repetitive.
Im scared to talk to her about it because i like her and i dont want her to think she's a bad therapist but i think she shares to much stuff with me(she's mentioned that she herself goes to therspy and i know a fair bit about her family dynamics) and even though it's usually not that personal it makes the sessions feel more like a discussion with a friend rather then a therapy session and i usually leave never having discussed what i wanted to. 
I know she cant mind read and that i have to make an effort but i already do that and i need help with talking about things its my biggest struggle thats why i go to therapy in the first place.
Im just terrified if i talk to her about this she'll react badly and if that happens i think I'll just completely spiral.

depression,"I overdosed on ibuprofen last year and I‚Äôm still trying to process exactly why I did it. It was the day before the SAT, and I had a firm belief that the SAT would just confirm the fact that I wasn‚Äôt as smart as everyone said I was; imposter syndrome. I didn‚Äôt take enough to kill me, but I had full opportunity to do so. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone for 12+ hours and it took my parents 4 days to find out it happened. I didn‚Äôt receive any counseling for that specific event. All it was was pain and feeling numb, yet happy, yet scared because I didn‚Äôt know when I was going to die. 

I don‚Äôt consider it to be a suicide attempt because I took exactly the amount to be considered an overdose, not more, not less. I don‚Äôt consider it to be a suicide attempt because I could have taken more of the medication and I could have taken different kinds of medication, but I wanted no one to really know what I had overdosed on; there were 4 pills left in the bottle and I refilled them with pills from a new bottle so that no one would notice anything different. 

I feel like my old therapist failed me for not talking about it. She pretended like it never happened. I don‚Äôt think my new therapist even knows.

depression,"So the guy I formally called my best friend (he‚Äôll be M), for a while, had a thing for my sister (she‚Äôll be H) and she had a thing for him. I personally never felt comfortable with the whole thing it made me feel more like a third wheel and that if anything went wrong, it could ruin everything.

Well, for years he would constantly promise me that nothing happens and, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my best bro, I think a relationship between us would feel kind of weird.‚Äù

My sister on the other hand, who already has a nasty attitude, has always been more demanding of a relationship with him, treating me like the bad guy when I say no. She even went as far as to use the, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my brother‚Äù, or, ‚Äúyour his best friend‚Äù argument against me, saying I don‚Äôt care.

Well, early last year, I did say yes. However, I only said it just because f how sick I was of the whole thing (I really regret that). For a while last year, H did end up in a relatively happy relationship with another boy and they even made it past six months. Despite all of that, she still kept whining that she wasn‚Äôt with M and even he was acting kind of rude about her being in a relationship (especially after he broke up with his girlfriend). He would tell her that her boyfriend that he looked suspicious and even blocked her on Snapchat for being in so much pain. After she broke up with him (which she wasn‚Äôt too upset about), she immediately got int a relationship with M. When he talked about it with me, he assured me that he didn‚Äôt intend to hurt me or anything like that, so I said okay. At the time, I was hurt after he made a promise that he wouldn‚Äôt do this. I only said okay because I didn‚Äôt know what to say, aside from this, I was depressed about school and the fact I wasn‚Äôt working, so I felt dead by the time he told me.

Throughout the relationship, it felt super awkward; as if they kind of forced each other to do this. Aside from that, there were several days my sister would be in tears because he forgot a date (normally fell asleep or just decided to stay in). Well, by January of this year, after getting fired from his job, he decided to just join the marines on a whim, which came as a shock to me and my friends. To my sister, however, she was devastated and, of course, tried to pressure me into solving this, as if I‚Äôd know what to do. Well, after a month of him training with them, M became a little more neglectful of the relationship which made my sister feel even worse. Well, one day they were going to go out together, but he of course forgot, and when she asked him why, he just told her, ‚Äúthings change, okay!‚Äù She was broken up about this and, of course, demanded I fix everything despite me wanting to study for a test I had to take in a couple of days. When I texted him about what he said and how I was shocked to see this side of him, he immediately snapped at me, even saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not her little puppy, so I‚Äôm not going to do everything she wants me to do!‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sticking my guns, even if it‚Äôs against my best friend!‚Äù That day was awful; the guy I called my best friend saw me as some sort of obstacle in his way and my sister, who I didn‚Äôt want in a relationship with him in the first place is demanding me to fix everything, even spamming my phone when I wasn‚Äôt textihin her back every 1 minute, so I couldn‚Äôt even have a single moment to myself that day. 

After that incident, M constantly kept spamming me with texts about how sorry he was and how the relationship with H might not have been a good idea. He kept trying to meet up with me, but kept forgetting the days we were supposed to meet up or just oversleeping, because of how much he‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen training (and staying up all night playing COD with his Xbox live friends). 

A couple of weeks after the incident, he finally broke off the relationship because he didn‚Äôt want any pressure of a relationship while he‚Äôs with the marines, which left H feeling even more devastated while she kept crying out about how ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fair‚Äù the breakup was. M told me that he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt her, but that he felt she was a little too needy and obsessive (he‚Äôs honestly not wrong there, unfortunately) and that it would be too much for him to handle. He was telling me that the reason he went out with her for what was essentially less than six months (both of their previous relationship lengths) was because, ‚Äúshe was a sweet girl (meh, not really)‚Äù and that after his break up, he wanted to simply give this girl who liked him a chance. That answer, I realized when he told me wasn‚Äôt so much a lie, rather just an exaggeration to more so fit his own narrative. As long as I‚Äôve known him, it makes sense since he‚Äôs done this to suit his narrative on any topic he may have a specific opinion on and doesn‚Äôt want to be proven wrong on. Regardless, he promised me once again, that he would never do this again.

As of late May, he‚Äôs been saying that he‚Äôll get together with me, and that we‚Äôll plan some hangout together, but he keeps missing them because he has other obligations, or sleeps for another 9 hours. Fine, I get it, he‚Äôs busy with the marines, but it hurts knowing he would do this to me time and time again, especially after he constantly says he wants to make everything up to me. Despite the fact that we are in a group chat together, he still hasn‚Äôt talked to me directly in a month, which I don‚Äôt feel good about. It‚Äôs only worse because I‚Äôve noticed him and my sister are talking again, having these long conversations together. 

I was scared of this, but I found out that as of last week, they‚Äôre starting to see each other again, which pisses me off to no end. H got into a huge argument with my parents about the whole thing. Although I do think my parents are somewhat ridiculous sometimes, I agree with them when they say that M wasn‚Äôt faithful to her and was hurting our friendship. She hasn‚Äôt been on good terms with them over this whole thing, and spent all of last week posting on her own social media‚Äôs about how she the victim in this whole thing; talking about how she and M are truly in love with each other and that they‚Äôre only mad at him because, ‚Äúhe was late picking me up one time‚Äù, while dancing around the whole entire conflict so she can rewrite it as someone who just wants a fairy tale love with the love of her life and that the ones telling her it‚Äôs a bad idea are the bad guys.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said that I wasn‚Äôt devastated all over again. However, I think at this point I‚Äôm just going to let them take responsibility for their own mistakes and won‚Äôt even consider them wrapping me in their own mistakes. I‚Äôm thankful that through all of this, my mom has been so supportive of me; reminding me that I shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this and that I should just focus on myself.

Me and my mom believe respect is something to be earned but I still give him respect because he is my dad. He used to physically abuse me as a kid for even the smallest things like speaking out of turn or forgetting to turn the water faucet off.

depression,"Hey everyone,

I am a non-depressed individual who has been spending the last several months learning about mental health. I am not completely sure how depression works just yet, so my apologies in advance if anything comes off as wrong or hurtful.

It seems like there are two *levels* of depression: underlying, ongoing depression and major, isolation depression. Obviously, people can experience both intertwined and that is waaay overgeneralizing it, although after reading through many posts and articles (especially ones with a relationship in the middle), it seems like the first level can be managed okay on its own (using ""managed"" lightly because I know it is difficult enough) and the second level is not manageable by being filled with unpredictability on its own.

This leads into my question: are you able to sense when a major episode/slump is coming? This also transitions into my next question: if so, is this why depressed individuals tend to push others away as an act of protection? I know depression can be confusing to process by itself, although I have come across many of the ""pushing away"" stories and wonder whether the depressed individual is often keen on what is happening or will happen, so they preemptively make the decision to save others from the hurt while undergoing an episode/slump.",Can you sense when a major episode/slump is coming?,EnergizedNuke,2020-06-18 21:51:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hbnucp/can_you_sense_when_a_major_episodeslump_is_coming/,2,0.75,2,9,214
